        "MONICA: Well put it back.",
        "MONICA: Here, let me try.",
        "MONICA: Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.",
        "MONICA: No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.",
        "MONICA: [carrying an ice cube tray] Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. Alright.",
        "MONICA: Really? I'm perfectly comfortable. [one of the guest opens the refrigerator] Hey, hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next. [she opens the refrigerator and leans into it]",
        "MONICA: No, I will not cave.",
        "MONICA: Ross.",
        "MONICA: [to Ross] Looks like he's playin' baseball.",
        "MONICA: Whatever.",
        "MONICA: So, wait, you really did like my cookies?",
        "MONICA: Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier.",
        "MONICA: Honey, I'm sorry.",
        "MONICA: So how was Joan?",
        "MONICA: How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?",
        "MONICA: Hello, Mr. Heckles.",
        "MONICA: We're not doing anything.",
        "MONICA: Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.",
        "MONICA: Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.",
        "MONICA: Mr. Heckles.",
        "MONICA: That's terrible.",
        "MONICA: What can we do for you?",
        "MONICA: Well, what about his family?",
        "MONICA: I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!",
        "MONICA: Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.",
        "MONICA: It doesn't go with any of my stuff.",
        "MONICA: You don't have any stuff.",
        "MONICA: No.",
        "MONICA: Mmmmm.",
        "MONICA: Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?",
        "MONICA: Hide the Lamp.",
        "MONICA: Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?",
        "MONICA: Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.",
        "MONICA: Phoebe, tell her!",
        "MONICA: Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.",
        "MONICA: You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.",
        "MONICA: You are not a freak. You're a guy.",
        "MONICA: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.",
        "MONICA: No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.",
        "MONICA: You made it!",
        "MONICA: No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.",
        "MONICA: That's fine.",
        "MONICA: Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.",
        "MONICA: Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't cry. Why is he still crying?",
        "MONICA: Maye it's me.",
        "MONICA: There's my little boy. (Ben starts crying again)",
        "MONICA: He hates me. My nephew hates me.",
        "MONICA: What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?",
        "MONICA: That is so funny. Let me see that. (throws the ball out the window)",
        "MONICA: Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi-- ",
        "MONICA: No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special. ",
        "MONICA: No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and--oh my god.",
        "MONICA: Oh my god.",
        "MONICA: Is your tongue swelling up?",
        "MONICA: All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital.",
        "MONICA: Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot.",
        "MONICA: Jacket now.",
        "MONICA: Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.",
        "MONICA: My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally. ",
        "MONICA: That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?",
        "MONICA: Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!",
        "MONICA: Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts.",
        "MONICA: That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.",
        "MONICA: Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?",
        "MONICA: Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?",
        "MONICA: No. But I remember people telling me about it.",
        "MONICA: Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.",
        "MONICA: That was you?",
        "MONICA: Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he's not crying.",
        "MONICA: I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.",
        "MONICA: Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?",
        "MONICA: Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.",
        "MONICA: Well, didn't you?",
        "MONICA: I can't believe you didn't tell me.",
        "MONICA: What have I not told you?",
        "MONICA: Wait a minute, who told you? [turns to Chandler who's looking sheepish] You are dead meat.",
        "MONICA: Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple.",
        "MONICA: That is wild.",
        "MONICA: Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.",
        "MONICA: I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.",
        "MONICA: Hell, I wanna see Joey.",
        "MONICA: All I say is, she better get the job.",
        "MONICA: You know, it still smells like monkey in there.",
        "MONICA: Rachel, that's all we do.",
        "MONICA: Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? [Rachel gives her a look from hell] That's fine.",
        "MONICA: I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross.",
        "MONICA: Guys, you got your hair cut.",
        "MONICA: This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?",
        "MONICA: It's just an expression.",
        "MONICA: Phoebes, you know what I'm thinking?",
        "MONICA: No, although now that's what I'm thinking.",
        "MONICA: Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?",
        "MONICA: Why not?",
        "MONICA: No you're not.",
        "MONICA: Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.",
        "MONICA: Please, just a little bit off the back.",
        "MONICA: Rachel, how did this happen?",
        "MONICA: Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.",
        "MONICA: My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't--but this is about your horrible mistake.",
        "MONICA: You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.",
        "MONICA: I promise.",
        "MONICA: What? I didn't say anything.",
        "MONICA: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.",
        "MONICA: How who wears it?",
        "MONICA: Demi Moore is not a he.",
        "MONICA: That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.",
        "MONICA: Oh my god!",
        "MONICA: She's the actress who was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost.",
        "MONICA: I KNOW!",
        "MONICA: Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.",
        "MONICA: Thank you. My hair is very amused.",
        "PHOEBE: I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.\nMONICA: And the fact that they're both monkeys.",
        "MONICA: [reading] 'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'",
        "MONICA: This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.",
        "MONICA: I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.",
        "RACHEL AND MONICA: Yeah.",
        "MONICA: Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.",
        "MONICA: Excellent!",
        "MONICA: Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.",
        "MONICA: And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't. [throws water in his face]",
        "MONICA: Ross, there he is.",
        "MONICA: Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.",
        "MONICA: Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot.",
        "MONICA: The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?",
        "MONICA: Rachel, he like, totally changed time.",
        "MONICA: Oh, yeah.",
        "MONICA: He could hear me.",
        "MONICA: Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook.",
        "MONICA: So what'd he say?",
        "MONICA: Well, thanks anyway.",
        "MONICA: Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...",
        "MONICA: Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself.",
        "MONICA: What did you say?",
        "MONICA: Ya know, you had no right to go out with him.",
        "MONICA: You sold me out.",
        "MONICA: Yes you did. Absolutely.",
        "MONICA: Did you just flick me?",
        "MONICA: Quit flicking [flicks]",
        "MONICA: You flicked me first.",
        "MONICA AND RACHEL: Ow. Ow. Ow.",
        "MONICA: Uh-huh.",
        "MONICA: OK.",
        "MONICA: Yes.",
        "MONICA: Fine,",
        "MONICA: I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? [he nods] Can you beat up that guy?",
        "MONICA: This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.",
        "MONICA: Well, what made you make the exception for me?",
        "MONICA: Say you're sorry.",
        "MONICA: Say it.",
        "MONICA: Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.",
        "MONICA: Say you're sorry.",
        "MONICA: What're you gonna do?",
        "MONICA: You don't have the guts.",
        "MONICA: I'll help you fix your sweater.",
        "MONICA: I'm sorry that I made you stop seeing him.",
        "MONICA: I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves [pulls Rachel's gloves out of her purse]",
        "MONICA: Well, bye for me too. [kisses him]",
        "MONICA: OK.",
        "MONICA AND RACHEL: Oh, no no no no no.",
        "MONICA AND RACHEL: No no no no.",
        "MONICA: But no. Maybe if I were baking.",
        "MONICA AND RACHEL: Bye-bye.",
        "MONICA: Great.",
        "MONICA: Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing.",
        "MONICA: A salad? Really I, I could do something a little more complicated if you like.",
        "MONICA: You got it.",
        "MONICA: Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.",
        "MONICA: Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.",
        "MONICA: That's your call.",
        "MONICA: Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.",
        "MONICA: They'r alright.",
        "MONICA: No really, they're OK.",
        "MONICA: Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.",
        "MONICA: I'm outa here. [Monica leaves]",
        "MONICA: Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me.",
        "MONICA: Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent.",
        "MONICA: No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.",
        "MONICA: Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few debloons.",
        "MONICA: Hi.",
        "MONICA: So, what's this.",
        "MONICA: Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?",
        "MONICA: Oh, God forbid.",
        "MONICA: Where have you been?",
        "MONICA: No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.",
        "MONICA: Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it.",
        "MONICA: Because they made me.",
        "MONICA and ROSS: In the bank.",
        "MONICA: Anything larger back there?",
        "MONICA: You have dinosaur checks?",
        "MONICA: Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful.",
        "MONICA: Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then.",
        "MONICA: Hey, you got me, put it in.",
        "MONICA: You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.",
        "MONICA: Over here dad. [he pans over and we see a torso taking up the whole screen]",
        "MONICA: Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.",
        "MONICA: Oh, you look so great.",
        "MONICA: Oops.",
        "MONICA: Shoot, I think I got mayonaise on you.",
        "MONICA: Oh, dad, turn it off.",
        "MONICA: Dad, it is not. What's with the red light?",
        "MONICA: Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper.",
        "MONICA: I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.",
        "MONICA: If you're not going then I don't want to go either.",
        "RACHEL, MONICA, ROY, and CHIP: Bye.",
        "MONICA: I can't believe you did that.",
        "MONICA: Mom, I'm hungry.",
        "MONICA: Alright.",
        "MONICA: Hey.",
        "MONICA: A mirror?",
        "MONICA: Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.",
        "MONICA: Cache? Jaunty?",
        "MONICA: Hey.",
        "MONICA: Oh my God, it was incredible.",
        "MONICA: Rachel you have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It's about how women need to become more empowered.",
        "MONICA: It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard.",
        "MONICA: No.",
        "MONICA: Yes. But all the other ones.",
        "MONICA: Isn't it.",
        "MONICA: Hey.",
        "MONICA: You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?",
        "MONICA: Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh!",
        "MONICA: I wa-",
        "MONICA: And I would have to say pah-huh.",
        "MONICA: Do you not remember the puppet guy?",
        "MONICA: And his puppet too.",
        "MONICA: Who?",
        "MONICA: Oh.",
        "MONICA: Woah, woah, woah, let's go back to 29.",
        "MONICA: Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.",
        "MONICA: One hour? You are such a leaf blower.",
        "MONICA: We didn't order cake.",
        "MONICA: You're right.",
        "MONICA: We're good.",
        "MONICA: Are you sure this time?",
        "MONICA: There is no alley behind Macy's.",
        "MONICA: So on this road trip, did you guys win any money?",
        "MONICA: Nice.",
        "MONICA: What about the part where he has rabies?",
        "MONICA: Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.",
        "MONICA: Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.",
        "MONICA: Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.",
        "MONICA: Ok. [Richard walks in] Hey, why don't you ask Richard?",
        "MONICA: I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?",
        "MONICA: C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.",
        "MONICA: So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag. [walks off]",
        "MONICA: Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay.",
        "MONICA: Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him?",
        "MONICA: So'd you guys have fun?",
        "MONICA: Really?",
        "MONICA: So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?",
        "MONICA: Ross.",
        "MONICA: Look. [they look at Joey in the kitchen with a cigar in his mouth, looking at his reflection in a spatula] Joey, do you know we can see you from here?",
        "MONICA: You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.",
        "MONICA: So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?",
        "MONICA: You're meeting Richard?",
        "MONICA: Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys.",
        "MONICA: With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?",
        "MONICA: So you watched the movies huh?",
        "MONICA: Alright, you wanna feel better?",
        "MONICA: Ok, here, watch this.",
        "MONICA: So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.",
        "MONICA: There's a game?",
        "MONICA: Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.",
        "MONICA: Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.",
        "MONICA: Oh, then go Vassar.",
        "MONICA: Ok, then just go.",
        "MONICA: Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.",
        "MONICA: It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?",
        "MONICA: I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.",
        "MONICA: Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.",
        "MONICA: Did you like it?",
        "MONICA: Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?",
        "MONICA: [enters] Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table.",
        "MONICA: [grabs the other two bars on Richard's side and scores] Score! Now can we go?",
        "MONICA: Um-hmm.",
        "MONICA: Nighty-nite.",
        "MONICA: [her and Richard return to her place] So are you ok?",
        "MONICA: Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.",
        "MONICA: Yeah, well they suck too.",
        "MONICA and PHOEBE: Hey.",
        "MONICA: I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.",
        "MONICA: Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.",
        "MONICA: Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.",
        "MONICA: Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.",
        "MONICA: No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.",
        "MONICA: OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.",
        "MONICA: Happy birthday dad.",
        "MONICA: Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.",
        "MONICA: Are we still on that?",
        "MONICA: I'm a twinkie.",
        "MONICA: Oh, this is so hard.",
        "MONICA: Maybe we should just tell your parents first.",
        "MONICA: God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.",
        "MONICA: Alright.",
        "MONICA: You remember that video I found of mom and dad?",
        "MONICA: Well, I just caught the live show.",

        "JOEY: No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.",
        "JOEY: That's how they do pants. First they go up one side, they move it over, they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?",
        "JOEY: What? That's not? Oh my god.",
        "JOEY: Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...",
        "JOEY: I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.",
        "JOEY: Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.",
        "JOEY: I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.",
        "JOEY: Well... I'm helping out down at the NYU Med School with some... research.",
        "JOEY: Oh, just, y'know.... science.",
        "JOEY: [sigh]... It's a fertility study.",
        "JOEY: Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.",
        "JOEY: We make fire. Cook meat.",
        "JOEY: Oh, OK.",
        "JOEY: I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.",
        "JOEY: What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?",
        "JOEY: Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have s*x with me.",
        "JOEY: Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.",
        "JOEY: Hey!",
        "JOEY: The country?",
        "JOEY: Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?",
        "JOEY: He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.",
        "JOEY: Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.",
        "JOEY: We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man. [Joey gives Ross a hug]",
        "JOEY: Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.",
        "JOEY: Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I--",
        "JOEY: Then you do. Heh, heh.",
        "JOEY: What do you mean?",
        "JOEY: Not following you.",
        "JOEY: [to Rachel]: That book got me through some tough times.",
        "JOEY: [pats Chandler on the leg] That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.",
        "JOEY: Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.",
        "JOEY: The country.",
        "JOEY: He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.",
        "JOEY: Heh, heh. It was nothin'.",
        "JOEY: [panicked] Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.",
        "JOEY: Sure! Why not?",
        "JOEY: How do you mean?",
        "JOEY: Shhhh!",
        "JOEY: She's still asleep.",
        "JOEY: Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?",
        "JOEY: Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!",
        "JOEY: It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.",
        "JOEY: I know! Neither did I!",
        "JOEY: Seven hundred bucks!",
        "JOEY: Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.",
        "JOEY: What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? [Joey closes his eyes and walks around with arms spread.]",
        "JOEY: Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.",
        "JOEY: Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.",
        "JOEY: No, my first fan mail.",
        "JOEY: Oh my god, I got my very own stalker.",
        "JOEY: Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?",
        "JOEY: Ah, the stalker.",
        "JOEY: Let's get out of here.",
        "JOEY: OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.\nCHANDLER: That's how radio stars escape stalkers.",
        "JOEY: She's comin'.",
        "JOEY: Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?",
        "JOEY: Erica.",
        "JOEY: Yeah it is. . . what?",
        "JOEY: Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites.",
        "JOEY: No one.",
        "JOEY: Good, otherwise my watch would fall off. [laughs hysterically]",
        "JOEY: Alright, just one. [she licks his hands rather emphatically] Wow, you're good at that.",
        "JOEY: Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.",
        "JOEY: But that's what...",
        "JOEY: Hey I- [she cuts him off with a kiss]",
        "JOEY: That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! [she starts nibbling his hand] Hey. He-hey.",
        "JOEY ON TV: Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God.",
        "JOEY: Oh my God, quick turn off the TV.",
        "JOEY: Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.",
        "JOEY: Hey Erica, c'mon in.",
        "JOEY: Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up?",
        "JOEY: Who?",
        "JOEY: It's not what you think, that was...",
        "JOEY: Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.",
        "JOEY: Somebody wanna help me out here?",
        "JOEY: 'Cause it's a television show.",
        "JOEY: I'm not Drake.",
        "JOEY: Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you.",
        "JOEY: Right. Goodbye Erica, good luck in Salem. Take care",
        "JOEY: OK, alright, the people who threw the water.",
        "JOEY: This is amazing.",
        "JOEY: I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies.",
        "JOEY: Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey. [guard lets them in]",
        "JOEY: Woah, dude, burn.",
        "JOEY: Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he?",
        "JOEY: Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me.",
        "JOEY: Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin', is he lookin'?",
        "JOEY: Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh.",
        "JOEY: You're blowin' me off for a monkey?",
        "JOEY: Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.",
        "JOEY: Oooh.",
        "JOEY: Yaaahhh. Ahhh, candles. What'dya thinks gonna happen here tonight?",
        "JOEY: Forget about it.",
        "JOEY: So, assistant to the director. That's a really exciting job, I mean, you must have a ton of cool responsibilities.",
        "JOEY: So what're you guys gonna eat?",
        "JOEY: Ma?",
        "JOEY: Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off.",
        "JOEY: Are you naked in there?",
        "JOEY: Huh, you uh, you always wear panties?",
        "JOEY: Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.",
        "JOEY: Well, let me see.",
        "JOEY: Alright, alright. [climbs up in the next stall and looks over at Chandler] Woah, someone's flossing.",
        "JOEY: Chandler's wearing panties.",
        "JOEY: Can't help you, I'm not wearing any.",
        "JOEY: Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.",
        "JOEY: Hey, hey, and I'm in the movie.",
        "JOEY: One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me and boom, I'm dying on the gurney. Oh Ross, Marcel just finished his last scene if you want to go down there and say goodbye.",
        "JOEY: Aaaaagggghhhhh.",
        "JOEY: Aaaaagggghhhhh.",
        "JOEY: Aaaaagggghhhhh. Mommy",
        "JOEY: Hey.",
        "JOEY: Nice, nice. Hey I got somethin' for you. [hands Chandler an envelope.",
        "JOEY: Eight hundred and twelve bucks.",
        "JOEY: Well, I'm makin money now and this is payin' you back for head shots, electric bills, and so many slices of pizza I can't even count. I love ya man.",
        "JOEY: Hey, this is a little extra somethin' for uh, ya know, always bein' there for me. [hands Chandler a jewelry box]",
        "JOEY: Heh, what d'ya say?",
        "JOEY: Isn't it? And it's engraved too, check it out.",
        "JOEY: Put it on.",
        "JOEY: Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything. [gets the bracelet from the drawer] You put this on, you're good to go. [puts the bracelet on Chandler] Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet.",
        "JOEY: You have any idea what this'll do for your s*x life?",
        "JOEY: If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.",
        "JOEY: Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?",
        "JOEY: You know what the. . . [sees Chandler on his knees, holding the couch cushions]",
        "JOEY: Hey.",
        "JOEY: How come you have two?",
        "JOEY: Get out.",
        "JOEY: Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.",
        "JOEY: [pulls out a VCR tape] Hey Monica, what's on this video tape?",
        "JOEY: What is with your nose?",
        "JOEY: Some girl ate Monica.",
        "JOEY: Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.",
        "JOEY: Hey.",
        "JOEY: Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?",
        "JOEY: Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.",
        "JOEY: Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache.",
        "JOEY: Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee.",
        "JOEY: Anybody want a croan.",
        "JOEY: So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?",
        "JOEY: No, can we get back to me?",
        "JOEY: Alright. Cab driver number two?",
        "JOEY: But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?",
        "JOEY: But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.",
        "JOEY: I'm sorry. See ya.",
        "JOEY: What is it?",
        "JOEY: See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.",
        "JOEY: It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.",
        "JOEY: Oh my God.",
        "JOEY: Look at this, how did I spend so much money?",
        "JOEY: Ahh.",
        "JOEY: My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do.",
        "JOEY: What?",
        "JOEY: That's a two line part.",
        "JOEY: So what.",
        "JOEY: Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic.",
        "JOEY: Yeah.",
        "JOEY: Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.",
        "JOEY: Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'",
        "JOEY: Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.",
        "JOEY: Look, I don't wanna hear this right now.",
        "JOEY: Well don't just say.",
        "JOEY: Ok.",
        "JOEY: I don't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray. That was huge. Big things are gonna happen, you'll see. Ross, you still there?",
        "JOEY: Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go.",
        "JOEY: Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show.",
        "JOEY: I fell down an elevator shaft.",
        "JOEY: What?",
        "JOEY: All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks.",
        "JOEY: What?",
        "JOEY: Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything. ",
        "JOEY: And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.",
        "JOEY: No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day. [gets up and leaves]",
        "JOEY: Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose.",
        "JOEY: They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.",
        "JOEY: Thanks Ross.",
        "JOEY: I went.",
        "JOEY: I didn't get it.",
        "JOEY: What?",
        "JOEY: Huh?",
        "JOEY: [movers removing a glass parrot] Oh, not my parrot.",
        "JOEY: I can't watch this.",
        "JOEY: Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register.",
        "JOEY: Thanks Ross. I really like that bird though...I'll take the dog though.",
        "JOEY: Hello.",
        "JOEY: I know I would.",
        "JOEY: Hey no problem.",
        "JOEY: Na, na I'm ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is...",
        "JOEY: A little foos?",
        "JOEY: What happened to the foosball?",
        "JOEY: He paid a lot of money for it.",
        "JOEY: Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky.",
        "JOEY: Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over.",
        "JOEY: Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.",
        "JOEY: No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.",
        "JOEY: Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?",
        "JOEY: I don't know.",
        "JOEY: How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?",
        "JOEY: [Monica walks back in the kitchen] Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.",
        "JOEY: Hey.",
        "JOEY: Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What's the matter with you, he's parking the car.",
        "JOEY: Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. [With money in his palm] Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats [shakes his had and passes the dollar].",
        "JOEY: No problem. Hey Chandler",
        "JOEY: Ok.",
        "JOEY: He-he-eyy. [Shakes his had and passes the dollar]",
        "JOEY: Ok. He kept my dollar.",
        "JOEY: How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?",
        "JOEY: Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.",
        "JOEY: Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks.",
        "JOEY: Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.",
        "JOEY: We're the guys.",
        "JOEY: Man you are incredible.",
        "JOEY: Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with.",
        "JOEY: No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads. [Chandler starts kicking him below the table] I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here.",
        "JOEY: Oh yeah.",
        "JOEY: Nooooo.",
        "JOEY: Not a dad.",
        "JOEY: Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?",
        "JOEY: What?",
        "JOEY: Yeah, so.",
        "JOEY: Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.",
        "JOEY: Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?",
        "JOEY: Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.",
        "JOEY: Hey.",
        "JOEY: Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch.",
        "JOEY: Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?",
        "JOEY: So where you gettin' it?",
        "JOEY: Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?",
        "JOEY: Can you believe this place?",
        "JOEY: Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.",
        "JOEY'S CO-STAR: Hey.",
        "JOEY: Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.",
        "JOEY'S CO-STAR: Thanks. You want it?",
        "JOEY: Huh?",
        "JOEY'S CO-STAR: Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one.",
        "JOEY: Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?",
        "JOEY'S CO-STAR: Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the kitchen.",
        "JOEY: Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.",
        "JOEY: Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.",
        "JOEY: Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.",
        "JOEY: I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.",
        "JOEY: What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.",
        "JOEY: Well that's how I feel.",
        "JOEY: Well then maybe I will.",
        "JOEY: Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.",
        "JOEY: Hey.",
        "JOEY: Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened. . .",
        "JOEY: I know. Yeah.",
        "JOEY: No, we're alright.",
        "JOEY: Plastic spoons. Great.",
        "JOEY: These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.",
        "JOEY: Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.",
        "JOEY: I'm movin' out like we talked about.",
        "JOEY: Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.",
        "JOEY: Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.",
        "JOEY: Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?",
        "JOEY: Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.",
        "JOEY: Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.",
        "JOEY: Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?",
        "JOEY: Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it.",
        "JOEY: Yes! And the table is mine.",
        "JOEY: Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?",
        "JOEY: Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.",
        "JOEY: Naa, you keep it, you need the practice.",
        "JOEY: So, I guess this is it.",
        "JOEY: Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again.",
        "JOEY: Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care.",
        "JOEY: Alright, no peeking. No peeking, no peeking, no peeking.",
        "JOEY: Alright open your eyes. [opens his eyes to see two black leather recliners and a big screen TV]",
        "JOEY: Huh? Days of our Lives picked up my option.",
        "JOEY: I know.",
        "JOEY: Uh-huh.",
        "JOEY: Whichever one you want, man. Whichever one you want. [Chandler starts to sit in one of the chairs] Not that one.",
        "JOEY: [sits down] Ohh yeah, that's the stuff.",
        "JOEY: We dare.",
        "CHANDLER and JOEY: Woah, hey, yo. [Rachel and Ross move]",

        "JOEY: Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?",

        "JOEY: Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.",
        "JOEY: No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.",
        "JOEY: No, that means nothin to me.",

        "JOEY: Eddie.",
        "JOEY: Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. [looks for the mail on the table by the door, it's not there] Where's the mail?",
        "JOEY: You don't keep it over here on this table any more?",
        "JOEY: Huh.",
        "JOEY: No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me.",
        "JOEY: So how you two gettin' along?",
        "JOEY: Great, well, I'm happy for ya. [picks up the orange juice carton and it's empty] Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice. There's no juice f or the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice.",
        "JOEY: Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man.",
        "JOEY: Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?",
        "JOEY: Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.",
        "JOEY: [sings] It may not be a bed of roses.",
        "JOEY: Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.",
        "JOEY: All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.",
        "JOEY: Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.",
        "JOEY: No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.",
        "JOEY: I did do it, I'm a professional.",
        "JOEY: See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother. ",
        "JOEY: Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.",
        "JOEY: Come on, I need your help here.",
        "JOEY: You see this, this is a friend.",
        "JOEY: Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?",
        "JOEY: Yeah, that makes sense. (looks at Ross)",
        "JOEY: Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much. (Chandler ignores him) Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone.",
        "JOEY: Aww, Rach, I think you look cute (kisses her on the cheek, then looks at Ross) And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon (goes to kiss him).",
        "JOEY: Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him (runs out)",
        "JOEY: (entering) Man, I got this close to him (holds up his fingers) and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on?",
        "JOEY: Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.",
        "JOEY: Aw, man I'm sorry (starts rubbing Chandler's shoulder). This must be very tough for ya, huh (and starts comfroting him looking for a kiss).",
        "JOEY: Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....Hello? Hello? (picks up a statue of an Indian and walks into\nhis room)",
        "JOEY: Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.\nEND",
        "JOEY: Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?",
        "JOEY: Oh no, what happened?",
        "JOEY: Yeah, I've had it.",
        "JOEY: But don't you need experience for a job like that?",
        "JOEY: Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.",
        "JOEY: Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.",
        "JOEY: Ha-ha. [Scott leaves] Are all you processors dorks?",
        "JOEY: Hey.",
        "JOEY: Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.",
        "JOEY: Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.",
        "JOEY: Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?",
        "JOEY: I figure my character has kids.",
        "JOEY: Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.",
        "JOEY: Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.",
        "JOEY: You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.",
        "JOEY: Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.",
        "JOEY: What a phony.",
        "JOEY: Sir.",
        "JOEY: Yeah Bing, what's that about?",
        "JOEY: This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.",
        "JOEY: Joseph's good, isn't he?",
        "JOEY: Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.",
        "JOEY: Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.",
        "JOEY: Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.",
        "JOEY: 'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.",
        "JOEY: Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.",
        "JOEY: What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.",
        "JOEY: Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.",
        "JOEY: Karen.",
        "JOEY: Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.",
        "JOEY: Really?",
        "JOEY: Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.",
        "JOEY: It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot. [Chadler pushes him out the door by the face.]",
        "JOEY: You guys, can we please not watch this all right.",
        "JOEY: (on tv) Oh, you said it Mike. (rips open the carton and spills\n      milk on the counter) Aw! There's got to be a better way!",
        "JOEY: Can we please turn this off?",
        "JOEY: (on TV, finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is\n      easy. (starts to poor the milk) Now, I can have milk everyday.",
        "JOEY: (entering) Hey!",
        "JOEY: Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't\n      show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first\n      good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the\n      message?!",
        "JOEY: How is it you?",
        "JOEY: Yep, that's my audition.",
        "JOEY: Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her\n      that I missed my chance.",
        "JOEY: Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to\n      friends, she only talks to agents.",
        "JOEY: What, what are you doing? What are you doing?",
        "JOEY: Hang up, hang up. (reaches with his good arm, but Phoebe grabs\n      it and he tries to reach the phone with his other arm but can't\n      because of the sling.)",
        "JOEY: I love that movie. (Joey is using it as a pillow)",
        "JOEY: I'm sorry, it just felt nice.",
        "JOEY: Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing\n      stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.",
        "JOEY: Hey, you know about that?!",
        "JOEY: Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I\n      understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than\n      one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much\n      like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of\n      heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of\n      bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of\n      commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed\n      guy there ever was.",

        "JOEY: It's okay, these things happen.",
        "JOEY: I'm, I'm okay. See. (tries to smile, but fails horribly)",
        "JOEY: No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had!\n      Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it\n      personally.",
        "JOEY: They actually said that?",
        "JOEY: No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents\n      always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went\n      another way', but this, I can use this. (in a very bad Italian\n      accent) I canna work on a new accent.",
        "JOEY: Okay, shoot.",
        "JOEY: I didn't get it?",
        "JOEY: Okay, what else?",
        "JOEY: Oh.",

        "JOEY: Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she\n      is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb\n      brains out.",
        "JOEY: You do, thanks.",
        "JOEY: Wait a minute.",
        "JOEY: Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get\n      out of being my agent.",

        "CHANDLER: Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.",
        "CHANDLER: Who said anything about Christmas?",
        "CHANDLER: So whaddya got there Monica?",

        "CHANDLER: Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?",
        "CHANDLER: Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.",

        "CHANDLER: Sure. (My god, that's a big head! It didn't look this big in the office. Maybe it's the lighting. My head must look like a golf ball at work.

        "CHANDLER: I so am.",
        "CHANDLER: Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track.",

        "CHANDLER: Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. [Joey walks in behind Chandler]",

        "CHANDLER: Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?",
        "CHANDLER: OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that.

        "CHANDLER: There was no fish when she dropped it off.",
        "CHANDLER: Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie...[puts his hand on Eddie's shoulder] Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon? [picks up the fruit an tosses it to Eddie, it hits Eddie in the chest and falls]",
        "CHANDLER: So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.",
        "CHANDLER: Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.",
        "CHANDLER: Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.",
        "CHANDLER: Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.",

        "ROSS: No? What happened, big guy?",
        "CHANDLER: (TO ROSS) 'Big guy'?",
        "ROSS: It felt like a 'big guy' moment.",
        "ROSS: Yeah, I mean- I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it- feel like your shot..?",
        "(ROSS AND CHANDLER LOOK AT EACH OTHER AND HUG AS WELL)",
        "ROSS: She is a kook.",
        "ROSS: What are you guys doing?",
        "ROSS: Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.",
        "ROSS: This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.",
        "ROSS: Hi, honey.",
        "ROSS: Hello to the rest.",

        "ROSS: Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.",
        "ROSS: My mommies love me. That's clever.",
        "ROSS: Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.",
        "ROSS: It's breast milk.",
        "ROSS: Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?",
        "ROSS: No!",
        "ROSS: Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.",
        "ROSS: I did not freak out.",
        "ROSS: Because it's breast milk. It's gross.",
        "ROSS: No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just don't think breast milk is for adults.",
        "ROSS: That would be no.",
        "ROSS: You've tasted it? You've tasted it.",
        "ROSS: Oh, you've tasted it.",

        "ROSS: Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.",
        "ROSS: No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!",
        "ROSS: Mmm hmmm.",
        "ROSS: Uh-huh.",
        "ROSS: This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.",
        "ROSS, CHANDLER & JOEY: Yes!",
        "ROSS: Would it matter?",
        "ROSS: I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?",
        "ROSS: If you wanna call that a reason.",
        "ROSS: Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.",
        "ROSS: Excellent!",

        "ROSS: What's the matter?",
        "ROSS: What?",
        "ROSS: Carol, what's the matter? What happened?",
        "ROSS: Oh my god.",
        "ROSS: It's ok. I'm sorry.",
        "ROSS: I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.",
        "ROSS: Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.",
        "ROSS: Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.",
        "ROSS: Any time. [He doesn't want to let her go]",
        "ROSS: Yeah, can't help but.",

        "ROSS: (on phone) Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.",
        "ROSS: Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?",
        "ROSS: I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.",
        "ROSS: That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.",
        "ROSS: Go over there and tell that woman the truth.",

        "ROSS: It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird.",

        "ROSS: Hi everyone.",
        "ROSS: [pulls Rachel aside] I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.",
        "ROSS: Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.",
        "ROSS: Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have s*x tonight so. . .",
        "ROSS: Pop it in.",

        "ROSS: Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.",
        "ROSS: That's all right, Rache, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica, Chandler, Joey. Everyone, this is Julie.",
        "ROSS: And bus.",
        "ROSS: You gotta hear this story.",
        "ROSS: But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.",
        "ROSS: Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby.",
        "ROSS: Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.",
        "ROSS: Hey, Rache, can I get some coffee?",
        "ROSS: Thank you.",
        "ROSS: I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?",
        "ROSS: It was you, pal.",
        "ROSS: Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.",
        "ROSS: I didn't order lemonade.",
        "ROSS: But--",
        "ROSS: How is that the silver lining?",
        "ROSS: Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.",
        "ROSS: Hello? Hi.",
        "ROSS: Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either. Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y--",

        "ROSS: Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by \"bye!\"",
        "ROSS: What's goin' on?",
        "ROSS: Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?",
        "ROSS: Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that. You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking \"Oh my god, I'm with Rachel\". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. Was there a second of all?",

        "ROSS: I'm going to China.",
        "ROSS: Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the bo--it's--it's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary [hands a sheet of paper to Monica]. Um... here's a picture of me... [hands it to Monica]",
        "ROSS: [to Monica]: Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?",
        "ROSS: Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.",
        "ROSS: Oh. [pause] Hey, who's Carl?",

        "ROSS: Fine, just stop thinking about me.",
        "ROSS: Can't do it, can you?",
        "ROSS: I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?",
        "ROSS: Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.",
        "ROSS: No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.",
        "ROSS: I know.",
        "ROSS: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?",
        "ROSS: [pause] No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?",
        "ROSS: Well, start looking.",

        "ROSS: I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.",
        "ROSS: Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.",
        "ROSS: Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.",
        "ROSS: Hey guys.",
        "ROSS: Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.",
        "ROSS: Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.",
        "ROSS: Oh my God, what happened?",
        "ROSS: I can't believe this.",
        "ROSS: Well, ya know, someone should have called me.",

        "ROSS: But you already told me everything.",
        "ROSS: Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey.",
        "ROSS: Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.",
        "ROSS: Well, there goes my whole belief system.",
        "ROSS: That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin.",
        "ROSS: Hans...Hans...Yo evil twin.",
        "ROSS: Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's right here in New York filming Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan.",
        "ROSS: I know.",
        "ROSS: This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.",
        "ROSS: Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?",
        "ROSS: Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together.",

Right now, what, I'm takin messages from guys she, she meets at the movies?

        "ROSS: Wha, OK, now how do you know that?",
        "ROSS: Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.",
        "ROSS: Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them.",
        "ROSS: No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella.",
        "ROSS: Would you look at that guy, I mean how long has he been talking to her. It's like, back off buddy she's a waitress not a geisha.",
        "ROSS: [Rachel, laughing, puts a hand on the guy's shoulder] Look at that, look at that, see how she's pushing him away and he won't budge. Alright, I'm gonna do something. [walks up in the middle of their conversation] Excuse me, are you Rachel?",
        "ROSS: I'm Ross Geller. Wha, I'm, God in your add you said you were pretty but wow.",

        "ROSS: I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?",
        "ROSS: Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want him for more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen , I mean, I feel like-",

        "ROSS: Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg.",
        "ROSS: Buy mommy.",
        "ROSS: Have a good time. Ok, Ben.",
        "ROSS: Yeah.",
        "ROSS: Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.",

        "ROSS: Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.",
        "ROSS: Thank you.",
        "ROSS: Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.",
        "ROSS: Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off.",
        "ROSS: What're you doing?",
        "ROSS: Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb.",

        "ROSS: Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.",
        "ROSS: Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.",
        "ROSS: Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.",
        "ROSS: Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.",
        "ROSS: Huh?",
        "ROSS: [enters] Ok, what the hell happened back there?",
        "ROSS: Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.",
        "ROSS: C'mon, what, you never think about our future?",
        "ROSS: No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.",
        "ROSS: The big book of childrens' names.",
        "ROSS: Yeah.",
        "ROSS: Ok fine.",
        "ROSS: We're not done.",
        "ROSS: Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.",
        "ROSS: Good, 'cause I love you.",
        "ROSS: Yeah.",
        "ROSS: Well that's the first time we've said that.",

        "ROSS: A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? [to Rachel] Hi.",
        "ROSS: No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?",
        "ROSS: I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'",
        "ROSS: Alright, shall we?",
        "ROSS: Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it. [opens door] We're here.",
        "ROSS: Hi ma.",
        "ROSS: Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.",
        "ROSS: Dad, you really don't want to do that.",
        "ROSS: Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.",
        "ROSS: Mon, Mon, are you OK?",
        "ROSS: Yeah.",
        "ROSS: Eww.",
        "ROSS: Ohh.",
        "ROSS: Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?",
        "ROSS: I'll take that dad. [grabs the bat]",
        "ROSS: You got a tattoo?",
        "ROSS: Lemme see. [looks]",
        "ROSS: Well it's really. . . sexy. I wouldn't have thought it would be but. . . wow.",
        "ROSS: Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?",
        "ROSS: Hey, save us some pizza. [they go off to Rachel's room]",
        "ROSS: Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck.",
        "ROSS: This screen is amazing, I mean Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.",
        "ROSS: Hey you. [they stand together in front of the TV.]",
        "ROSS: Oh you know, pretty much the usual, uh, sun shining, birds chirping.",

        "ROSS: Bye guys.",
        "ROSS: I told you there was going to be sub-titles.",

        "ROSS: Oh.",
        "ROSS: Mon.",
        "ROSS: Mon.",
        "ROSS: What, what.",
        "ROSS: And that's, that's funny why?",
        "ROSS: I, I know it's big, I just didn't know it was uh, ha-ha big.",
        "ROSS: OK, my hands were no where near your butt.",
        "ROSS: No see now, now I can't because uh, I'm feeling too self conscious.",
        "ROSS: Nuh, uh, the moment's gone.",
        "ROSS: That's romantic.",
        "ROSS: No.",
        "ROSS: No.",
        "ROSS: No.",
        "ROSS: That was 14 hours ago.",
        "ROSS: Oh. Listen, have you ever been uh, you know, foolin' around with a girl and uh, she started laughin'?",
        "ROSS: Yeah. I don't know, I've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know. And I just want it to be perfect and right and. . . why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint?",
        "ROSS: Hey.",

        "ROSS: Oh, I promise, what.",
        "ROSS: Who's Richard Burke? Doc, Doctor Burke? You have a date with Doctor Burke? Why, why, why should that bother me? I, I love that man, he's like a uh, brother to dad.",
        "ROSS: Doctor Burke is sexy?",
        "ROSS: [his beeper goes off] It's the museum again, can I, oh.",
        "ROSS: [on the phone] Woah, woah, woah australopithicus isn't supposed to be in that display. No. No. No, n, homo-habilus was erect, australopithicus was never fully erect.",
        "ROSS: Oh look, I can't believe this. Look, homo-habilus hasn't even learned how to use tools yet and they've got him here wi, with clay pots. Why don't, why don't they just give him a microwave? I'm sorry, I'm sorry this is taking so long, ya know, I, I, it's just it's longer than I expected, we will have dinner.",

        "ROSS: What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.",
        "ROSS: Hi.",
        "ROSS: I know it is pretty unbelievaaaaah.",
        "ROSS: We're not alone. [A church youth group is outside the display watching them]",
        "ROSS: Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?",
        "ROSS: Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?",
        "ROSS: Yeah.",
        "ROSS: I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.",
        "ROSS: Hi honey, how did it go?",

        "ROSS: Really?",
        "ROSS: All right.",
        "ROSS: What?",
        "ROSS: You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares.",
        "ROSS: That's who.",
        "ROSS: Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?",
        "ROSS: Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery....game?",
        "ROSS: I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.",
        "ROSS: Oh, here, I, I'll get it for ya. Whad'ya want?",
        "ROSS: Scotch. Alright, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass.",

        "ROSS: Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom. Stay clear of the salmon mousse.",
        "ROSS: Oh, mine too. Isn't that neat, scotch neat. Would you excuse me? [walks out in the hallway, Mr. Greene is walking out of Chandler and Joey's apartment] Hey, hey, where you uh, sneakin off to mister?",
        "ROSS: No. no.",
        "ROSS: No, um, see 'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir.",
        "ROSS: All righty roo. [closes the door] What a great moment to say that for the first time. [goes to get the cigarettes and glasses]",

        "ROSS: Neil Sedaka wears them.",
        "ROSS: Ohh, big smoker. [Packs the cigarettes and flings one on Mrs. Greene in the process. Finally gets one in his mouth and it look really out of place] Big big smoker. In fact I'm gonna go ou into the hallway and fire up this bad boy. [as he walks into the hall, he comes face to face with Mr. Greene]",
        "ROSS: Yes. [pulls them off and hands them to Mr. Greene] I was just warming up the earpieces for you.",
        "ROSS: [pulls the cigarette off his upper lip and hands it to Mr. Greene] Yeah, yes it is, I was just moistening the tip.",
        "ROSS: I'm getting ready for the water skiing. [Mr. Greene opens the door which pulls Ross in] How are you doing?",
        "ROSS: Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.",
        "ROSS: On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.",
        "ROSS: Freakish.",
        "ROSS: Oh yeah.",

        "ROSS: Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat.",
        "ROSS: Because it's a special hat. [Chandler looks at Ross funny] See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler...",
        "ROSS and CHANDLER: [both enter looking down] Hhhiiii.",

        "ROSS: Hi.",
        "ROSS: What?",

        "ROSS: You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.",
        "ROSS: Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat.",
        "ROSS: Thank you Gunther. We didn't want to have to go and do that.",
        "ROSS: Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice. [flicks the ends of the big bully's tie]",
        "ROSS: I know.",
        "ROSS: Let's, let's take this outside? Who talks like that?",
        "ROSS: Yeah.",
        "ROSS: Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight you guys.",

        "ROSS: No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.",
        "ROSS: Yeah, sure.",
        "ROSS: No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.",
        "ROSS: Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take?",
        "ROSS: I think we proved our point.",
        "ROSS: Cannot feel my tounge.",
        "ROSS: Yes, and that's why we're here.",
        "ROSS: Woah, ho-ho, whad'ya got there, a weapon?",

        "ROSS: Really?",
        "ROSS: Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.",
        "ROSS: Animal s*x, animal s*x? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk s*x?",

        "ROSS: No. You're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now, OK, you're not... rommmates anymore.",
        "ROSS: No, there is no way he was a velociraptor. No Tony, look at the cranial ridge, OK. If Dino was a velociraptor, he would have eaten the Flintstones. Yeah, yeah. [Monica comes out of her room] Oh, were you takin' a nap?",
        "ROSS: Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line. [gets the other line] Hello. Oh yeah she's here but uh, can she call you back? OK thanks. [hangs up the other line] Call Joanna. [back on with Tony] Hi.",

        "ROSS: Why, why, why can't you stand me being here? I don't, I, we're just, ya know, we're just havin' fun.",
        "ROSS: Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids.",
        "ROSS: You hated me when we were kids?",
        "ROSS: Why did you hate me?",
        "ROSS: And that wasn't fun for you?",
        "ROSS: I can't believe you hated me.",

        "ROSS: Over my dead body! (Joey looks at Chandler)",
        "ROSS: (entering from Rachel's bedroom) Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good! (turns around, and under his breath, to the rest of the guys) Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good.",
        "ROSS: So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.",
        "ROSS: What's she look like?",
        "ROSS: Get out!",

        "ROSS: Hey, there. ",
        "ROSS: Are you all right?",

        "ROSS: Okay, good luck (kisses her and leaves)",
        "ROSS: I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'",
        "ROSS: Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad.",
        "ROSS: (standing up) Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that...",
        "ROSS: Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.",
        "ROSS: Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis. (da-doom-chesh) (to drummer) What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me (looks for the da-doom-chesh, and doesn't get one) Cheers.",
        "ROSS: (runs after her) No, Rach!",
        "ROSS: Marenge,",
        "ROSS: Everybody!",
        "ROSS: (seeing her also) Yeah, 'cause life's just that kind.",
        "ROSS: All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes (kisses Joey).",
        "ROSS: [enters] Hiii.",
        "ROSS: Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox.",
        "ROSS: Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it.",
        "ROSS: You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.",

        "ROSS: I'm shipping out tomorrow.",
        "ROSS: Alright you know, why don't I just meet you upstairs. [Drops her on the couch and walks out holding his lower back.]",
        "ROSS: (to Chandler) Are you intrigued?",
        "ROSS: There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi (Ben is\n      holding a Barbi doll) What's ah, what's my boy doing with a\n      Barbi?",

        "RACHEL: Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for \"Smelly Cat\".",
        "RACHEL: Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.",
        "RACHEL: Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying.

        "RACHEL: I think it's sexy.",
        "RACHEL: Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have s*x.",
        "RACHEL: Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?",
        "RACHEL: I'd wait.",
        "RACHEL: Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more.",
        "RACHEL: Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have s*x with, with another man. That just means it's working.",
        "RACHEL: More than jewelry. [Rachel struts off, extremely pleased with herself]",

        "RACHEL: Great, people having s*x, that's just what I need to see.",
        "RACHEL: Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.",
        "RACHEL: No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.",
        "RACHEL: Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?",

        "RACHEL: Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.",
        "RACHEL: Maybe you should put it off.",
        "RACHEL: I know, yeah, sorry.",
        "RACHEL: Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that.",
        "RACHEL: Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen.",
        "RACHEL: And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.",
        "RACHEL: Ohh, God.",
        "RACHEL: Oh my god. Oh my god. Excuse me. Emergency! Excuse me!",
        "RACHEL: Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you?",

        "RACHEL: And the chicken poops in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.",
        "RACHEL: Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?",
        "RACHEL: Yeah, sure.",

        "RACHEL: Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.",
        "RACHEL: Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.",
        "RACHEL: I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here.",
        "RACHEL: Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?",
        "RACHEL: Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.",
        "RACHEL: Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.",
        "RACHEL: I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.",
        "RACHEL: At his apartment. Is this juice?",
        "RACHEL: I know, I know I'm a pathetic loser.",
        "RACHEL: Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?",
        "RACHEL: I'm glad it's not a problem.",
        "RACHEL: How is she?",
        "RACHEL: I'm ok.",
        "RACHEL: When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, then 50 feet of crap, then me.",
        "RACHEL: Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?",
        "RACHEL: I don't know, I don't know.",
        "RACHEL: Wait, are you leaving?",
        "RACHEL: Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all, what?",
        "RACHEL: No.",
        "RACHEL: No, I think that was the whole all.",
        "RACHEL: No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andy McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.",
        "RACHEL: You're welcome.",
        "RACHEL: Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.",
        "RACHEL: Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.",

        "RACHEL: No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens.",
        "RACHEL: Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?",

        "RACHEL: I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So what should I tell her?",
        "RACHEL: Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, I said no.",
        "RACHEL: He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.",
        "RACHEL: Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.",
        "RACHEL: And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.",
        "RACHEL: Does anybody need anything?",
        "RACHEL: That is so unfair.",
        "RACHEL: Alright, I feel that this is totally unjustified. [Monica starts making faces behind her back] She gave me the green light, I did nothing but-. Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?",
        "RACHEL: That is the most ridiculous.",

        "RACHEL: Oh that's what you want.",
        "RACHEL: Fine.",
        "RACHEL: No. [hitting each other]",
        "RACHEL: No. [hitting again]",

        "RACHEL: Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo. [she bends over and bears her tattoo right when Ross returns]",

        "RACHEL: Agh, it was the graduation from hell.",
        "RACHEL: Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.",
        "RACHEL: My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is?

        "RACHEL: It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...",
        "RACHEL: Oh ok.",
        "RACHEL: Ok.",

        "PHOEBE: Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.",

        "PHOEBE: I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just...",
        "PHOEBE: Not for you.",

        "PHOEBE: Oh.",
        "PHOEBE: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls.",
        "PHOEBE: I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.",
        "PHOEBE: Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.",

        "PHOEBE: Oh God.",
        "PHOEBE: Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?",
        "PHOEBE: OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?",
        "PHOEBE: [realizes] Oh.",
        "PHOEBE: Oh.",
        "PHOEBE: Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. . . OK, um, in Ithica. . . alright, um, Saratoga. . . Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information. [hangs up]",
        "PHOEBE: Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.",

        "PHOEBE: OK, let's go.",
        "PHOEBE: Alright, here, you have to hold this. [hands Chandler a piece of paper]",
        "PHOEBE: Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.",
        "PHOEBE: Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it. [Chandler jumps out of the car]",
        "PHOEBE: Ooh, this is it, 74. [screeches to a halt, Joey and Chandler are thrown into the plexiglass wall in the cab]",
        "PHOEBE: Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh.",
        "PHOEBE: OK, here I go. I'm goin' in.",

        "PHOEBE: No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . .",
        "PHOEBE: Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.",
        "PHOEBE: Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.",
        "PHOEBE: Yeah?",
        "PHOEBE: You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.",
        "PHOEBE: Oh, I couldn't go in.",
        "PHOEBE: Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.",
        "PHOEBE: Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?",

        "PHOEBE: Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?",
        "PHOEBE: Nah. Not really.",
        "PHOEBE: I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.",
        "PHOEBE: Yeah, I just don't buy it.",
        "PHOEBE: Ok, don't get me started on gravity.",
        "PHOEBE: Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.",
        "PHOEBE: Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!",
        "PHOEBE: Really? You can actually see it?",
        "PHOEBE: See, I didn't know that.",
        "PHOEBE: Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?",
        "PHOEBE: Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.",
        "PHOEBE: Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.",
        "PHOEBE: What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.",
        "PHOEBE: He's even kind of cute.",
        "PHOEBE: I'd call that excessive.",
        "PHOEBE: Janice? You called Janice?",
        "PHOEBE: Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.",
        "PHOEBE: Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.",
        "PHOEBE: Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?",
        "PHOEBE: I can't believe you caved.",
        "PHOEBE: You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?",
        "PHOEBE: Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.",
        "PHOEBE: Uh huh. Why is that?",
        "PHOEBE: Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!",
        "PHOEBE: You're there!",
        "PHOEBE: Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.",
        "PHOEBE: (singing) I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it. My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget.",
        "PHOEBE: (singing) Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.",
        "PHOEBE: But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk.",
        "PHOEBE: And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.",
        "PHOEBE: Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could. ",
        "PHOEBE: Really?",
        "PHOEBE: Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting. How much am I gonna get?",
        "PHOEBE: Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing.",
        "PHOEBE: Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.",
        "PHOEBE: No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. (Out on the sidewalk, singing) When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity. (Someone puts a coin in her guitar case) Thank you! La la la la la la la....",
        "PHOEBE: (singing) ... with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar player?",
        "PHOEBE: Right. My name was on there, but now it just says \"carrot cake\". So, um, so um, how many chords do you know?",
        "PHOEBE: Oh yeah, so you know D?",
        "PHOEBE: Ok, do you know A minor?",
        "PHOEBE: Ok, do you know how to go from D to A minor?",
        "PHOEBE: Ok. Um, so does your guitar have a strap?",
        "PHOEBE: Oh. Mine does. (singing) Stephanie knows all the chords. (makes a face)",
        "PHOEBE: (singing angrily) Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!",
        "PHOEBE: (singing/screaming) You're all invited to bite me!",
        "PHOEBE: Oh, hi.",
        "PHOEBE: Thank you.",
        "PHOEBE: Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.",
        "PHOEBE: No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang \"Su-Su-Suicide\", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, \"Smelly Cat\", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.",
        "PHOEBE: It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money.",
        "PHOEBE: Really? From who?",
        "PHOEBE: Yeah. Here you go.",
        "PHOEBE: No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's \"smelly cat, smel-ly cat\".",
        "PHOEBE: Better. Yeah.",
        "PHOEBE: Yeah, much better. And you know what, don't feel bad, because it's a hard song.",
        "PHOEBE: You wanna try it again?",
        "PHOEBE: Ok, there is no top. That's the beauty of Smelly Cat. Um, why don't you just follow me?",

        "PHOEBE: OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.",
        "PHOEBE: I might have.",
        "PHOEBE: Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything.",
        "PHOEBE: Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having s*x with Fun Bobby out on the terrace.",
        "PHOEBE: You have a third nipple?",
        "PHOEBE: Yeah, is there a hair on it?",

        "Originally written by Jeff Astroff and Mike Sikowitz .\nTranscribed by Mindy Mattingly Phillips.\nPHOEBE: Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like \"forget about her\" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, \"Oh my god.\" So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?",

        "PHOEBE: And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.",

        "PHOEBE: Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him.",
        "PHOEBE: Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.",
        "PHOEBE: Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'.",
        "PHOEBE: Thanks. [gets out of the cab]",
        "PHOEBE: [a little dog starts attacking her leg] Hey, hey, no, oh oh.",
        "PHOEBE: No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wanna love all animals, please no.",
        "PHOEBE: Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap. [Flings the dog off and jumps in the cab. The dog keeps jumping up to the window.] Ok, alright, we have a problem.",
        "PHOEBE: Are you crazy?",
        "PHOEBE: Yeah, I don't know.",
        "PHOEBE: I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.",
        "PHOEBE: Ok, thanks. Sorry, again",
        "PHOEBE: [innocently] What was that?",
        "PHOEBE: [enters] Hey.",
        "PHOEBE: Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow.",
        "PHOEBE: Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.",
        "PHOEBE: I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.'",
        "PHOEBE: Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok. [goes over and grabs the phone that's sitting by Monica]",
        "PHOEBE: So talk to her.",
        "PHOEBE: Hi.",
        "PHOEBE: It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose. She's a vegetarian.",
        "PHOEBE: Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast.",
        "PHOEBE: Sure, oh, is, is Frank home.",
        "PHOEBE: Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here?",
        "PHOEBE: Oh, ok, um, I mean Frank senior.",
        "PHOEBE: Ok so will he be back soon?",
        "PHOEBE: Alright, I'm, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry.",
        "PHOEBE: Um well I don't really. Just genetically. He's kinda my dad too.",
        "PHOEBE: Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?",
        "PHOEBE: Oh.",
        "PHOEBE: Stilts?",
        "PHOEBE: Wow.",
        "PHOEBE: I don't know what to do with that.",
        "PHOEBE: Yeah.",
        "PHOEBE: I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'",
        "PHOEBE: That'll work too.",
        "PHOEBE: Yeah, that'd be ok.",
        "PHOEBE: Ok, I'm in the book.",
        "PHOEBE: Alright. So um, stilts huh?",
        "PHOEBE: Ok.",
        "PHOEBE: Hey nice boobs.",
        "PHOEBE: No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.",
        "PHOEBE: Why don't you play with your roommate?",
        "PHOEBE: Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?",
        "PHOEBE: Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?",
        "PHOEBE: Oh yeah, it'll be fun. [throws a tennis ball at Eddie's bedroom door]",
        "PHOEBE: Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of us had some beers and got to know each other.",
        "PHOEBE: Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye.",
        "PHOEBE: I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him. [leaves]",
        "PHOEBE: And a crusty old man said I'll do what I can and the rest of the rats played moroccas. That's it, thanks, good night.",
        "PHOEBE: I know.",
        "PHOEBE: Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech. I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the best.",
        "PHOEBE: Ok.",
        "PHOEBE: Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.",
        "PHOEBE: Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture.",
        "PHOEBE: Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?",
        "PHOEBE: Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?",
        "PHOEBE: Why would you kill his fish?",
        "PHOEBE: Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks.",
        "PHOEBE: But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.",
        "PHOEBE: Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say.",
        "PHOEBE: [looking at a water sculpture that looks like a window with rain running down it] Hey, excellent, excellent water-table thing. ",
        "PHOEBE: Yeah, well me too, yeah. I think that's the challenge.",
        "PHOEBE: So why don't ya show us the rest of your casa?",
        "PHOEBE: Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. You are not gonna believe this. I have just been discovered.",
        "PHOEBE: Anyway, OK, now promise you won't like, freak out and say how great this is until I'm done, OK.",
        "PHOEBE: OK. I just met this producer of this like, teeny record company, who said that I have a very fresh, offbeat sound and she wants to do a demo of Smelly Cat.",
        "PHOEBE: I told you not to do that yet. And, she wants to do a video.",
        "PHOEBE: I'm not done yet, OK. God. OK, if that goes well, they may even want to make an album.",
        "PHOEBE: I'm done now.",
        "PHOEBE: Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?",
        "PHOEBE: OK. [singing] Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat [back up singers start singing smelly, smelly, smelly, smelly behind her] Oh woah, oh my God. I mean like, who was that?",
        "PHOEBE: OH!! Oh I thought they were just watching me. You know, like at, like at an aquarium, ya know.",
        "PHOEBE: OK. [singing] Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat [back up singers - smelly, smelly, smelly, really bad smelly cat, it's not your fault] OK, sorry. I'm just, I'm just not getting that everyone um, gets how smelly this cat acually is. I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the cat.",
        "PHOEBE: Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go.",
        "PHOEBE: Hey.",
        "PHOEBE: Oh, check it out, oh check it out. It's Smelly Cat the video.",
        "PHOEBE: Now OK, I haven't seen it yet so, if you don't like it, well, so what, none of you ever made a video. [puts the tape in] OK.",
        "PHOEBE: Oh my God.",
        "PHOEBE: I sound amazing. I, I, I've never heard myself sing before. I mean, except in my own head. Oh, this is so cool, now I can hear what you hear.",
        "PHOEBE: Oh, I am sorry but I am incredibly talented.",
        "PHOEBE: Hey.",
        "PHOEBE: Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video.",
        "PHOEBE: Yes.",
        "PHOEBE: Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.",
        "PHOEBE: Well, I can't work with people who would do this.",
        "PHOEBE: I mean this poor woman.",
        "PHOEBE: The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a video.",
        "PHOEBE: Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels.",
        "PHOEBE: [singing] Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Everybody.",
        "PHOEBE: Monica.",
        "PHOEBE: Chandler.",
        "PHOEBE: Rachel.",
        "PHOEBE: Uh, Ross, those are the only lines we have, sorry. OK, you guys, once more.",
        "PHOEBE: Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing (Chandler and Monica, give her a look that says 'think about it') Ooh.",
        "PHOEBE: All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.",
        "PHOEBE: Uh-huh, let's go. (they move in to kiss) Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. (they kiss rather passionately) Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.",
        "PHOEBE: (laughing) Oh my God, you look so good!",
        "PHOEBE: Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?",
        "PHOEBE: All right, stop it, you're freaking me out.",
        "PHOEBE: I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like.",
        "PHOEBE: Come on, like you never talk that.",
        "PHOEBE: Bye, good luck.",
        "PHOEBE: So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that (points at the computer screen).",
        "PHOEBE: What does she mean by HH?",
        "PHOEBE: Are you the cutest?",
        "PHOEBE: You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy.",
        "PHOEBE: It could be like a big giant guy.",
        "PHOEBE: We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.",
        "PHOEBE: Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'",
        "PHOEBE: Well at least we know she's a woman.",
        "PHOEBE: Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?",
        "PHOEBE: Oh, my.",
        "PHOEBE: She wants to meet you in person.",
        "PHOEBE: What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.",
        "PHOEBE: Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her! (Chandler runs and picks up his shoes) Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww. (Chandler runs to the bathroom, as the computer bing-bongs) No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first. (Chandler runs to the computer) No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much. (Chandler walks slowly into the kitchen)",
        "PHOEBE: Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil. I think what you have to do is try not to...",
        "PHOEBE: [enters] Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.",
        "PHOEBE: Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.",
        "PHOEBE: Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.",
        "PHOEBE: No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.",
        "PHOEBE: Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. [Sees a red bump on her arm.] Oh look!",
        "PHOEBE: Yeah? Are you sure, really. [She picks up a mirror and sees the white splotches all over her face.]",
        "PHOEBE: I, I, I'm hideous.",
        "PHOEBE: Come in.",
        "PHOEBE: Hey Ryan, what's up?",
        "PHOEBE: Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.",
        "PHOEBE: Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.",
        "PHOEBE: 'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.",
        "PHOEBE: Ohh, ohh.",
        "PHOEBE: Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.",
        "PHOEBE: Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.",
        "PHOEBE: And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... [she unveils herself right as a huge lightning bolt crashes outside. Ryan screams in terror.] Oh, I am scary.",
        "PHOEBE: I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.",
        "PHOEBE: Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.",
        "PHOEBE: That you don't stop talking about it.",
        "PHOEBE: Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. [She picks up the dice.] Here we go, double sixes, here we go... [She starts to rub the dice all over herself.] Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice...",
        "PHOEBE: No. This is what I do for luck, ok.",
        "PHOEBE: No.",
        "PHOEBE: No. Here. [Throws them on the table.] There. Ooh, double sixes.",
        "PHOEBE: Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body. [Grabs a handful of the houses.]",
        "PHOEBE: Give it.",
        "PHOEBE: Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good. [She starts scratching him.]",
        "PHOEBE: Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.",
        "PHOEBE: Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.",
        "PHOEBE and RYAN: Bye. [waving]",
        "PHOEBE: It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up.",
        "PHOEBE: Please. [Ryan pulls the cork with his teeth and spits it into Phoebe's mits.]",
        "PHOEBE: I got it. [Wipes it up with her mits.]",
        "PHOEBE: What?",
        "PHOEBE: Oh.",
        "PHOEBE: You know what, that's it, that's it. [She rips off the mits, Ryan follows her lead.]",
        "PHOEBE: Ok, I'll walk you out.",
        "PHOEBE: I know. We didn't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that. [They kiss.]",
        "PHOEBE: Bye you. [Ryan's cab drives off. As Phoebe is going back in, she sees the Central Perk sign in the window and laughs.]",
        "PHOEBE: Oh, oh! It's on again!",
        "PHOEBE: Hey.",
        "PHOEBE: Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! (they all stare at her) Okay,\n        it was me! ",
        "PHOEBE: Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean,\n        Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7\n        and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell\n        you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it. (shows\n        him her hand)",
        "PHOEBE: Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.",
        "PHOEBE: That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my\n        fault.",
        "PHOEBE: What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh (starts\n        dialing). ",
        "PHOEBE: No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. (on the phone in a different\n        voice) 'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um,\n        is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'",
        "PHOEBE: (on phone) 'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey\n        Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak\n        to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to\n        do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns\n        down the apartment, the world does not stop.'",
        "PHOEBE: (on phone) 'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition,\n        that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll,\n        what time can you see him?' (to Monica) I need a pen. (Chandler\n        hands her one, but she needs something to right on, so she\n        tilts Chandler's head over and writes on the back of his neck)",
        "PHOEBE: Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone\n        again?",
        "PHOEBE: (on phone, in 'Katelynn's' voice) 'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay\n        returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have\n        to patch you through.'",
        "PHOEBE: (in voice, on phone) 'Okay, go ahead.' (in normal voice on\n        phone) Um, hi Annie. (listens) Fantastic! (to Joey) You got\n        it. (on phone) Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work for scale?' you ask\n        me. Well, I don't know about that, (Joey clears his throat to\n        signify yes) except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are\n        such a sweetheart. I would love to have lunch with you, how\n        about we have lunch next....(hangs up phone) Op, went through\n        a tunnel.",
        "PHOEBE: It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone\n        before.",
        "PHOEBE: Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.",
        "PHOEBE: Two?",
        "PHOEBE: Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right",
        "PHOEBE: (entering) Helloo! Oh! (sees Joey and starts to leave)",
        "PHOEBE: No it's not, sorry.",
        "PHOEBE: Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in\n        those....pants.",
        "PHOEBE: Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't\n        get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",
        "PHOEBE: But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a\n        terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the\n        person who makes your face look like that.",
        "PHOEBE: Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry\n        I quit, okay, I just quit.",
        "PHOEBE: Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an\n        Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.",

        "PHOEBE: Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to\n        work on. ",

        "[Scene: Phoebe's grandmother's place. Phoebe's grandmother is sitting at the table, reading the obituaries, and crossing out names in the phonebook.]",

        "CHANDLER: Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. [Joey gets a sheepish look] You used my toothbrush?",
        "MONICA: I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore.",
        "JOEY: Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.",

        "Monica: It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh! (drops it in Ross's cereal)"
