        "Why is this car in my bedroom?",
        "When did I sign for it?",
        "Did you make brownies today?",
        "(to Phoebe) Quick, take off your dress, he won’t notice the bed.",
        "Sometimes I have bad dreams. (starts to break down, and Phoebe offers her, her hand to comfort her.)",
        "Joey, you’re this guy’s teacher. I mean how could you do this?",
        "Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I’m the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.",
        "God, look what I found in the drain.",
        "It's some of Richard's hair! (holds it close to Ross) What do I do with this?",
        "It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh! (drops it in Ross's cereal)",
        "God, what is wrong with me.",
        "I need to get some Richard.",
        "I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!",
        "What are you the memory woman?",

        "All right, I'll try not to.",
        "Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?",
        "I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.",
        "Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.",
        "(crying) So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.",
        "Uh, huh. (to Ross) Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away. (Rachel, Monica, and Phoebe leave)",
        "Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?",
        "I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad?",
        "What makes you think that I might not be okay?",
        "Oh.",
        "I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?",
        "No, I really, really do.",
        "Really!",
        "You're not just saying that are you?",
        "Was he crying?",
        "Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?",
        "I think so.",
        "(entering from bedroom) Okay, I’ll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I’m sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.",

        "I know.",
        "So, I’ll get-get back to my friend.",
        "Oh, that’d be great.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Bye! (to Chandler) Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my life.",
        "What are you doing with the lamp?",
        "Oh, well don’t take it to the same place you took the stereo, ‘cause they’ve had that thing for over a week.",
        "Hi, again.",
        "Thank you soo, much.",
        "You want some help with that?",

        "Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?",
        "Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.",
        "This place is really my Grandmother’s. (Joey starts to take off all of his clothes, while Monica gets the glasses and pours the lemonade.) I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I’m 87 year old woman, who’s afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?",
        "(turning around) Okay, here’s your pen1s!",
        "Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!",
        "So?!",
        "Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!",
        "I don’t believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have s*x?",
        "It’s okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.",
        "Pheebs?",
        "Where’s your bed?",
        "What?",
        "What are you talking about?",

        "What?!?!",
        "You can spill. In the sink.",
        "I love you, too.",
        "What? I’m just said.",
        "Hey.",
        "(all depressed) Help yourself.",
        "Phoebe moved out.",
        "I don’t understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don’t have a boyfriend?",
        "Well, I think so.",
        "I know, it is isn’t it?",
        "Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.",
        "Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.",
        "I know. Thanks. (Chandler leaves)",
        "Hey, are you okay?",
        "No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.",
        "So, Chandler, who’s on your list?",
        "First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.",
        "Hey! Where ‘ya headin’ in those pants? 1982?",
        "Why, what’s wrong with my bathroom floor?",
        "I highly doubt that. (they both go to the bathroom)",
        "I can’t live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?",
        "That’s a little more than I wanted to see.",
        "I can’t leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.",
        "You know that’s nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!",
        "What kind of karate is that?",
        "So how’s it going with you guys?",
        "Oh honey, we’re close now but you-you wouldn’t believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and....(Phoebe shakes her head like she doesn’t understand) That’s where the waistband actually goes over your head.",
        "Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.",
        "Oh, how do you play the shadow game?",
        "I just asked you.",
        "No, that is what the game is.",
        "What’s the matter?",
        "He’s retiling my floor. (they both run to the bathroom)",
        "Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.",
        "It’s beautiful! It’s like the first bathroom floor there ever was. (Chandler tries to go to the bathroom) Whoa! Are you going in there for?",
        "And who laminated it?",
        "Are you serious? (they all look) Oh my God.",
        "Why? ‘Cause otherwise you’d go for it?",
        "Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?",
        "You broke a little girl’s leg?!!",
        "Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...",
        "All right, I’ll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that’s it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. (to Ross) Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?",
        "No.",
        "Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t do this.",
        "(she reaches out for it and stops) Oh God! I gotta go! (runs out)",
        "(comes up and starts looking through Ross’s cookie supply) Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?",
        "What?",
        "No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it’s no big deal, all right, I’m-I’m cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!",
        "(covers her neck) Oh God! (runs to the bathroom)",
        "Christmas cookie?",
        "(entering) Hey, guys. I’m here to pick out my Christmas tree.",
        "Is this the one that I threw out last year?",
        "Oh honey, is that ‘cause your Mom died around Christmas?",
        "Oh. (turns and looks at Joey, who gives a ‘way-to-go’ thumbs up and smile.)",
        "(jumping up from behind the couch) Merry Christmas!!",
        "Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.",
        "Every year.",
        "Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the ‘Geller Bowl.’",
        "Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind’ve competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross’s nose.",
        "To score the winning touchdown, by the way.",
        "(to Chandler and Joey) I won the game.",
        "Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it’s been twelve years.",
        "(shouting) Once!!",
        "Okay. Let’s bring it in.",
        "Well, why don’t we just bunny up.",
        "Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.",
        "Phoebe.",
        "All right people listen, I’ve got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.",
        "Huddle up.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay, Phoebe you know what you’re doing right?",
        "Okay, Joey’s gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block.",
        "Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you’re doing?",
        "Break.",
        "Score!! 7 to nothing!",
        "Losers walk!",
        "Come on guys! Let’s go! Come on, it’s second down.",
        "No it’s not, it’s second.",
        "Wow, what?",
        "Pulling what? It’s second down.",
        "I heard that!",
        "All right, come on guys, let’s go! Tie score, and we’re runnin’ out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike! (the timer sounds as Monica throws the ball to Phoebe.)",
        "Run, Phoebe, run!",
        "After the snap!",
        "Does so count!",
        "Y'know what, that’s fine, maybe you haven’t grown up, but I have.",
        "Dead leg!! (kicks him in the thigh.)",
        "No! Listen, I’m not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can’t blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let’s just call this, tie score and it’s halftime.",
        "Y'know what? I’ll think you’ll play.",
        "Because the winner gets this!",
        "When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.",
        "No it’s not! You want it, you’re gonna have to win it!",
        "Come on Phoebe, let’s go! Come on, it’s time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.",
        "All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?",
        "All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I’ll take care of the rest.",
        "Break!",
        "Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don’t see that everyday, do ya?",
        "What?! I just touched him and he went over.",
        "Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!",
        "You’re so pathetic! Why can’t you just accept it, we’re winning because I’m better than you.",
        "Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I’ll prove it to you, okay. I’ll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I’ll still win the game.",
        "Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.",
        "Come on Rach, come on. Let’s see what’s it like to be on a winning team for a change.",
        "All right then.",
        "Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.",
        "We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you’re making out...",
        "Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let’s kill ‘um!",
        "All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we’re down by two points. Two points.... (she gets interrupted by the guys, who are doing a slow-motion high five.) Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.",
        "Honey, there’s a reason.",
        "All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I’ll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.",
        "Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!",
        "No! I’m not okay!",
        "Come on! Come on! Hurry! We’re running out of time! Huddle up!",
        "All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.",
        "Break!",
        "Let go! I’m a tiny little woman!!",
        "Ow!!",
        "Let go!",
        "No!",
        "I don’t know. I guess the other people just don’t care enough.",
        "Let go!",
        "Please, I'm not going for anything.",
        "Would you please go?",
        "Look Julio, someone left their book here.",
        "Oh yeah, what are you reading?",
        "Have I read it? (pause) No, are you enjoying it?",
        "Your a poet and don't know it. (she turns away and makes a face like 'I can't believe I just said that.')",
        "Oh, then you do know it. (pause) So um what kind of things do you write about?",
        "Mine? (points to her lower lip) Right here?",
        "How would that go? (they kiss) Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.",
        "(entering) Hi!",
        "It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem.",
        "Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out. (hands them the poem)",
        "Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs?",
        "Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work. (tries to take the poem)",
        "All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh-ho, look what I got Julio.",
        "Yeah, just like the one in the poem.",
        "What do you mean?",
        "(to Julio) So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?",
        "Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.",
        "You don't even know me...",
        "What?",
        "I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...",
        "(sarcastically) Oh yeah.",
        "Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, (turns sideways\n        on the couch) so that you can bunny bump against my back.",
        "See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.",
        "Oh, now you want a pad.",
        "(entering from her bedroom) I gotta go to work. Has anybody\n        seen my left boob?",
        "There it is. Joey, what are you doing?",
        "What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to\n        feel something, you have to run away?",
        "Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant\n        until you get us to break up with you.",
        "Uff.",
        "That is never good.",
        "Ohh! (both grab there stomachs in pain)",
        "Welcome to our side of the tunnel.",
        "You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you\n        gotta switch to low-fat.",
        "Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just\n        need some damage control.",
        "Nooo!",
        "She has to know that your not ready.",
        "My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.",
        "You know what, everything's gonna be okay. ",
        "If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.",
        "Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you\n        just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.",
        "Aw, it's soo unfair. (they both start digging into the 'good'\n        ice cream)",
        "What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big\n        deal. You used to dress up like a woman.",
        "Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.",
        "The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.",
        "How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea. ",
        "Wasn't there a little song?",
        "(singing) 'I am Bea.'",
        "'I drink tea.'",
        "'....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '",
        "A-ha!!! (they all start laughing, as Ross hides in the\n        bathroom)",
        "(entering the shot) Ross!!! (starts to wipe up the\n              spill)",
        "You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.",
        "So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?",
        "Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you\n        wanna show Rachel? Come here. (takes Ben) We’re gonna do\n        something fun. Okay. (throws Ben up in the air a little bit\n        and catches him) Weee!! (moves into the living room and does it\n        again) Weee!! (starts to walk back into the kitchen as she\n        does it again, and hits Ben’s head on that wooden beam across\n        the ceiling.)",
        "(to Ben) Who’s so brave, you’re so brave, yes you are,\n        you’re so brave.",
        "He’s not gonna say anything, because we’re not gonna tell\n        him.",
        "No we’re not.",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!",
        "Okay, we’re gonna need a distraction.",
        "I got it!",
        "The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take\n        him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that\n        makes him go, (high pitched) rweee!!",
        "A hat! Yes! We need a hat.",
        "Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?",
        "Because he’ll know what to do? (Rachel comes out of her\n        room with a bear that’s dressed in a rain suit.) Oh my God,\n        you’re a genius!",
        "Give it. Give it.",
        "It just makes more sense as an ensemble.",
        "Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.",
        "Sure, we have no money, go ahead.",
        "Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?",
        "Did he just say ‘Monica bang’?",
        "Oh my God! He’s gonna rat me out!",
        "Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that,\n        now. It’s no big deal, it’s not even worth mentioning, you see\n        we all do it all the time. See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben.\n        (goes over and starts hitting her head on the post) Ow, Monica\n        bang! (does it again) Everybody bang. (repeats) Ben bang.\n        (repeats) Rachel bang. (repeats) Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn’t\n        that fun?",
        "You okay?",
        "Okay, Ben, I won’t tell your daddy that you had ice cream\n        for dinner, if you don’t tell about our little bonking incident.",
        "Oh that’s right, that’s what I’d sound like if I exploded.",
        "All right, we should call somebody.",
        "How are we gonna do that? There’s no way.",
        "Yeah.",
        "No. Why?",
        "Really?!",
        "Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!! (runs into the bedroom)",
        "(coming out of the bedroom) You jerk! You know how\n        much I love that kid! (starts to chase Ross around the living\n        room)",
        "And yet, we’re still poking him.",
        "Um-mm.",
        "Wow. Joey, (sarcastically) how do you do it?",
        "He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.",
        "I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.",
        "All right, be my guest.",
        "Honey, what’s the matter?",
        "It’s Joey’s birthday.",
        "Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.",
        "I know honey, I’m sorry.",
        "(gives her a look) Gee, I don’t know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!",
        "Hey Gunther. Hi. (to Phoebe) I mean you’re going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?",
        "I know, he’s too charming, but if you two start going out, then it’s just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.",
        "Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?",
        "(to Chandler) Stick out your tongue.",
        "Oh my!!",
        "How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey’s sisters.",
        "Hi.",
        "Isn’t that great?",
        "Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, ‘Hummina-hummina-hummina.’ (walks away)",
        "How ya feelin’?",
        "What is the worse part?",
        "Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he’s actually going to kill you dead.",
        "I mean, was it Gina?",
        "No, no, no, that’s Dina.",
        "That was me.",
        "That’s okay.",
        "Y'know which one was she again?",
        "No honey, I’m sorry, but the weekend’s not over yet.",
        "I guess they’re back from their date.",
        "Oh my God!",
        "I am good. I finished my book.",
        "I don’t remember. Do you wanna take a walk?",
        "Wait a minute, why don’t you just call Mark. (they both look up in shock) I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you’ve got to make stuff happen.",
        "(to Ross) Honey, it’s not pushy, he gave her his home number.",
        "Yay!",
        "Oh, that is amazing!",
        "What?",
        "Are you crazy?!",
        "What?! Ross y'know this isn’t even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you’re right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?",
        "I mean don’t you trust her?",
        "Then get over yourself! Grow up!",
        "So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?",
        "Yeah, I do know.",
        "Y'know if it’s any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you. (Rachel nods in agreement)",
        "(to Phoebe) Look at you. All jealous.",
        "Yeah, sure.",
        "Y'know those are a delicacy in India.",
        "Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?",
        "Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.",
        "Hey.",
        "No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.",
        "Yeah, Ginger something.",
        "No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, (singing) ‘the movie star.’",
        "Well, what did you do?",
        "Y'know what, don’t tell us. We’ll just wait until Chandler gets home, (to Phoebe) because it’ll be more fun that way.",
        "You gave her food poisoning!?",
        "Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?",
        "Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.",
        "Phoebe why don’t you just call her? You obviously want to.",
        "Well, don’t ‘cha wanna?",
        "Okay, well I do know you.",
        "Well so?",
        "(entering) Hi!",
        "Oh, can I borrow this? (points to his milk) My milk’s gone bad.",
        "So umm, how was your date with Ginger?",
        "Sounds like she’s got the ah, whole package.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Sorry, Pheebs.",
        "We’d love too.",
        "Wow! It’s like Rachel in High School.",
        "Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!",
        "Hey.",
        "How’s the big anniversary dinner?",
        "Ohhh, nice.",
        "What?! (She accidentally starts the blender without the lid on it and fruit flies everywhere.)",
        "That’s okay, this is more important than fruit (pause) (angrily) on my ceiling! You broke up?!",
        "Oh no!!",
        "Rachel, you and Mark?!",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh, there’s banana on it.",
        "So then you know? (Phoebe nods her head)",
        "Oh, good. Thanks.",
        "Okay, all right don’t judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....",
        "Yes! Have you seen it?",
        "I know!!",
        "Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!",
        "Did that!",
        "Okay. (Does so.) Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!",
        "No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.",
        "That’s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don’t believe me, please, by my guest.",
        "Now, are you glad we didn’t start with the bikini strips?",
        "Ow!",
        "Ow!! Ow!!",
        "It’s okay, it’s okay.",
        "We were just waxing our legs.",
        "That’s right.",
        "What?",
        "(going over to listen at the door) Rachel said everything was okay.",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Oh!! (hits Chandler and Joey in the head) You guys knew about this and you didn’t tell us?!",
        "(stopping him) What, what are you doing? You can’t go out there.",
        "Because they’ll know we’ve been listening.",
        "What if they don’t?",
        "Hey. It’s three in the morning. They don’t know that I’ve come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.",
        "Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?",
        "No! Rachel is meeting us here.",
        "It’s never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.",
        "(seeing her) Okay, let’s go!! Let’s hit the road!!",
        "Let’s get the show on it!",
        "Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it’s sooo close.",
        "We’re sorry honey.",
        "Very bad.",
        "Chandler!!",
        "Weren’t you nine?!",
        "We’re really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.",
        "Noo! I’ll stay. He’s my brother.",
        "No! We’re gonna have fun. We can make fudge!",
        "Why? Do you think he’s still mad at us?",
        "No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.",
        "What?",
        "Ow!",
        "(getting out) No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.",
        "So, if you’re parents hadn’t got divorced, you’d be able to answer a question like a normal person?",
        "What?!",
        "Please!!",
        "These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it’s gotta be Rachel.",
        "All right then, your bra would still be big.",
        "Chandler!!",
        "Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?",
        "Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.",
        "So the going for help went well?",
        "Then why are you smoking?",
        "(running over to stop Rachel) Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let’s stock up. (takes her into the bathroom)",
        "(reading the sign) What’s ‘pleh’?",
        "Huh. What’s doofus spelled backwards?",
        "I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?",
        "Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?",
        "Here we go again.",
        "(shyly) I don’t know.",
        "What I said was, was that I understood. Joey’s the one who agreed with you!",
        "All right, we’ll call you when we get back.",
        "(to clerk) Hi.",
        "Six? I just had it for one night. It’s three.",
        "Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you’re gonna have to help me out here, ‘cause I only have three.",
        "Oh my God. Richard? (turns around) Hi!",
        "Wow! Your lip went bald. (Richard pays the clerk) Hey, thanks.",
        "Right.",
        "What?",
        "(removes them) That’s because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it’s static cling. Or maybe it’s just that God knew I’d be running into you and saw an opportunity.",
        "It’s good to see you too.",
        "You see that guy? He’s in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he’s going straight to the p0rn.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Me too.",
        "Oh, um, I don’t know if that’s a good idea.",
        "No, I just I think that it’s too soon.",
        "(entering from her bedroom) Morning.",
        "Yeah well, I ran into Richard.",
        "Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.",
        "Tomorrow night.",
        "It’s not a date, okay. I’m just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.",
        "We’re not gonna have s*x! Okay, nothing’s changed here. He still doesn’t want children and I still do, so that’s why we’re just gonna be friends.",
        "You say ‘Thank you very much,’ and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we’re gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we’re gonna start squishing the tomatoes.",
        "You touch people’s eyeballs every day and this feels weird.",
        "Oops.",
        "Gotta keep squishing.",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.",
        "Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it (does so) and it should umm, be.....",
        "Umm, you’ve got some on your pants.",
        "So, how’d the lasagne go over? (listens) Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. (listens) Yeah, I’ve been thinking a lot about you too. (listens) I know. It’s hard this whole platonic thing. (listens) It’s a word!",
        "Yeah, I do think it’s better this way. (listens) Yeah, we’re being smart. (gets up to answer the door) (listens) Yes, I’m sure.(she opens the door and it’s Richard)",
        "I’ll call you back. (starts kissing him)",
        "So we can be friends who sleep together.",
        "Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?",
        "Oh.",
        "No! (pushes him) No!",
        "‘Cause if you do that means you’d be cancelling it for me, and we’re just friends.",
        "Hi.",
        "You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, (opens her coat revealing a large burn mark over her left breast.) in a grill fire.",
        "What are you smiling at?",
        "Yeah, right.",
        "I love this friend thing!",
        "Ow!",
        "Oh my God! Oh my God! (She frantically tries to clean up the bedroom as Richard starts the tour.)",
        "(still hiding under the blankets) So um, who was she?",
        "(still hiding under the blankets) Did you like her? And I’m just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.",
        "(gets up) Okay, y'know what, I’m not fine, I’m not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... (pause) Y'know what, what if we’re friends who don’t see other people?",
        "Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.",
        "That’s not true, you don’t have a moustache.",
        "Y'know what, I’ve got to walk out of here right now, ‘cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don’t think I could do it again.",
        "How ‘bout one last game of racquetball?",
        "Watch the thorns!",
        "(to Joey) What’s so funny?",
        "Oh. (she laughs)",
        "Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don’t you think he’s a little young to get married?",
        "So, um, how-how did you guys meet?",
        "And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I’ve only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.",
        "(to a customer) Pete, can I get you something else?",
        "Haven’t you and I covered that topic?",
        "Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.",
        "I mean really, think about it.",
        "Nah, he doesn’t do anything for me.",
        "Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids…. (realises) All right, I get your point.",
        "Hey.",
        "Uh, yeah.",
        "Here you go.",
        "As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I’d call him.",
        "That’s Bill Clinton.",
        "Oh my God! That’s Pete! But why is Bill huggin’ Pete?",
        "I’m not gonna go out with him.",
        "Or incredibly offensive.",
        "What the hell is this? (holding up the check)",
        "Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?",
        "You’re supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what’s-what’s the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?",
        "What?!",
        "Okay, umm, you’re a loon.",
        "I don’t know.",
        "‘Cause I don’t want to encourage this kind of behaviour.",
        "Guys, please, I’m just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?",
        "I know!!",
        "(opening the door) (to Pete) Hey!",
        "And that’s why, I’m not inviting you in for a drink. (starts to leave) Bye.",
        "(in the hallway) So, where do you want to go?",
        "Oh, that’s sounds great.",
        "Oh come on, it’s only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?",
        "Why, how much is that?",
        "I won’t give you anything, but you’ll owe me 2.95.",
        "Why? (in a motherlike tone) Do you have a report due?",
        "Okay, let’s start with the free messages outside the UN.",
        "Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what country is this guy from?",
        "Where’s that?",
        "I don’t have an atlas.",
        "Oh, but wait I do have a globe.",
        "Hold on.",
        "‘Kay, here you go. (Hands her this tiny little globe.)",
        "It’s a globe and, a pencil sharpener.",
        "Oh, no thanks.",
        "Well, if you don’t have anything to copy, why are you going down there?",
        "Wow! It’s small.",
        "So you had fun, huh?",
        "No.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh no, she’s still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her.",
        "All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. (holds up a notepad) Call Rachel.",
        "Oh that’s my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. (to Phoebe) She’s fancy.",
        "Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?",
        "Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? (Mischa laughs) Why? What did I say?",
        "Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.",
        "I’m also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.",
        "Well, I was having a conversation.",
        "What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?",
        "Oh. (to Phoebe) Can I have a tissue?",
        "Hey, the man’s dog just died.",
        "It will be my pleasure. (to Phoebe) My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can’t even say coupons. (they leave)",
        "Oh, this is so great.",
        "All right then. (He leans in to kiss her goodnight, but she quickly kisses him on the cheek and pats his shoulder.) Bye.",
        "Hello, people who do not live here.",
        "I gave you a key for emergencies!",
        "He’s great! I mean we have such a good time together! He’s so funny, and sooo sweet, and I’m not attracted to him at all!!",
        "Noo!! It’s driving me crazy. I mean every other way he’s like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.",
        "Two.",
        "Absolutely! (He goes to kiss her, but she stops him and rubs his head and says...) Now get out of here you!! (Pete leaves) (to the gang) Okay, I’m running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there’s no future? Either they’re too old, or they’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me, and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something’s wrong with me?!",
        "Sure.",
        "(looks around) Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I’m gonna say, midget rodeo.",
        "Okay. Umm, y'know, I don’t think, I don’t think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.",
        "So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn’t the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I’m just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?",
        "I so wanna be attracted to you.",
        "I’m sorry.",
        "It’s not?",
        "Well, um, look I-I don’t want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn’t attracted too.",
        "Hey, Rach, how was work?",
        "By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.",
        "Something wrong?",
        "Wow, you’re really crazy about her, huh?",
        "Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!",
        "Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! (Ross gives her a look) (to Ross) And I’m sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?",
        "I get the dollhouse!",
        "Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.",
        "Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.",
        "Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper’s a little faded, that’s okay. Carpet’s a little loose. Hardwood floors!!",
        "I know!!!",
        "Okay.",
        "What’s this?",
        "Not one that can pee on the roof.",
        "I don’t want a ghost.",
        "Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that’s it, that’s it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They’re not the right size, they’re not Victorian, and they just don’t go.",
        "It’s very interesting, Phoebe.",
        "Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!",
        "You’re kidding?! That’s great!",
        "Oh my.",
        "Come on Rach, when a guy says he’s going to call, it doesn’t mean he’s going to call. Hasn’t it ever happened to you?",
        "Hmm, bite me.",
        "(from the bathroom) I’m in the shower!",
        "Oh, that’s okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.",
        "(runs over to her) I tried to reach you at work. There’s....been a fire.",
        "Well, the giraffe’s okay. And so is the pirate.",
        "I need two. I’m bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now!",
        "Really? Who’s number two?",
        "Bye-bye!",
        "Joey, what are you doing?! It’s never gonna happen, she’s seeing somebody.",
        "(to Phoebe) Here you go. You can wear this. (hands her a sweater)",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Phoebe?",
        "All right. Honey, that’s-that’s a sleeve. Okay?",
        "And! We also have speaker phone. (She turns on the speaker phone.)",
        "Okay, wait, you gotta hang up ‘cause we’re gonna be late.",
        "Of course not.",
        "There’s our star!",
        "Hi!",
        "Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah. Where were you?",
        "You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.",
        "(entering from her bedroom) Pheebs, you’ve been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn’t healthy.",
        "Hey! Didn’t you have that outfit on last night?",
        "Anyway, how did it go with Kate?",
        "Joey, you had the night!",
        "When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!",
        "Did you like learn about her family?",
        "Yes!!",
        "Oh! (They hug, triumphantly.)",
        "One.",
        "We’re kidding!",
        "Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.",
        "Phoebe, it’s been two days.",
        "What?",
        "(sarcastic) Oh.",
        "Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.",
        "That was you?!",
        "Hi! Hey, Pete you’re back! Hey, check this out. (She starts to\n        skate over to him)",
        "Wow! You’re a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a\n        piece of paper. So how was you’re trip?",
        "Oh, what’d ya bring me?! (She opens the gift) Awww, hotel\n        toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent\n        collection. You want some coffee?",
        "(popping back up) Regular or decaf?",
        "Okay. (hands him a cup)",
        "So what did you do today Pete?",
        "What?! Oh.(She turns around quickly and falls)",
        "Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?",
        "I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy\n        Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica’s Bakery. I mean I would kill\n        for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows\n        I paid my dues. (She removes her fake breasts) But Pete’s just\n        doing this because he has a crush on me.",
        "Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him?\n        I-I-I-I can’t. I couldn’t even accept a necklace from Stu\n        Vincent in the seventh grade.",
        "Oh, please. ",
        "What? Honey.",
        "Oh God, I’m so sorry.",
        "Oh God!",
        "Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel\n        Sanders. (Ross starts to leave) Ross! Ross! I’m kidding!",
        "What-what was it you were gonna tell us? ",
        "Okay. Here’s the thing.",
        "I can’t do it. I’m sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have\n        these feelings for me....",
        "Huh?",
        "Oh?",
        "Oh, that’s great! I mean I’m-I’m sorry, but I’m so happy for\n        you. And now I can work for you!",
        "Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! (she rolls over and\n        kisses him on the cheek) All right, y'know what? I’m just\n        gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!",
        "Okay. (she gets ready to go) Can you give me a little push?",
        "(rolling towards the office) I’m quitting!! Woo-hoo! (She\n        rolls through a doorway and out of sight. We then hear a big\n        crash, and see Monica roll past the door the other way.) I’m\n        okay!! I’m all right!!",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey, guess what I’m doing tonight.",
        "I’m checking out the restaurant with Pete.",
        "I know.",
        "What?",
        "Okay, but wouldn’t it be easier if you had to tell me\n        something that you could tell me.",
        "Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?",
        "Does it have to do with Joey?",
        "Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he\n        keeps by his bed?",
        "Does it involve travel?",
        "Does it involve clogs?",
        "Clogs.",
        "Claws?!",
        "Okay, so it doesn’t involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey.\n        But, what about Pete?",
        "What is it?! What about Pete?",
        "Okay, I feel like I’m talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe\n        would you just tell me!",
        "Okay, I gotta go. (gets up)",
        "Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete’s computer\n        company?",
        "I don’t believe this! Wow, look at this refridgerator! It’s\n        gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I’d be cold, but\n        I’m always cold. Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I\n        love spider burners.",
        "Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much. (runs over and hugs\n        him)",
        "Did you just smell my hair?",
        "Oh God.",
        "You still have feelings for me don’t you?",
        "Pete.",
        "No, it’s not bad. It’s not bad at all. It’s-it’s really nice.",
        "You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with\n        being the one who hurts you. That’s why I can’t take this job.",
        "And well, we probably shouldn’t see each other anymore. I’m\n        sorry.",
        "Okay, bye. ",
        "All right shut up for a second and let me just see something.\n        (She kisses him back on the lips) Oh, wow! (They then hug and\n        kiss, very passionately.)",
        "Pete's breaking up with me.",
        "I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk.",
        "Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.",
        "Really?!",
        "(starting to get up) I gotta go water Pete's plants. (stops) Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.",
        "Yeah. Which one do you like more?",
        "Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! (the lights turn on automatically, but are very bright) Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away! (they dim) Oh, see you just need to find the right command.",
        "No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.",
        "I know.",
        "Joey, put that down! (the phone rings) Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone! (steps in front of it, and automatically answers it)",
        "I guess that's how.",
        "Oh it’s umm, good! It's umm, it’s good, just here watering the plants.",
        "Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news.",
        "Oh no-no-no, it's still me.",
        "Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon.",
        "I love you.",
        "Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.",
        "Oh my.",
        "And that's Pete's Mom.",
        "Would you stop? We’ve only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don’t even know if he’s gonna propose.",
        "Well if-if that’s what it is, then it’s-it’s crazy.",
        "Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.",
        "Brides magazines?",
        "It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. (Rachel slams the magazine shut in amazement.) I know it’s a little sudden, and it’s a little rushed, and it’s totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn’t mean I can’t. Right? I mean I’m-I’m crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.",
        "I know. (pause) I need more pie. (goes and gets some)",
        "So then, are you going to dump Jason?",
        "Ooh, nice.",
        "Oh, right! I completely forgot about that.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Wow.",
        "What’s that?",
        "Okay. (not sure of herself)",
        "You wanna what?!",
        "What are you talking about?",
        "And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.",
        "My parents will be so happy.",
        "(closing the fridge in disgust) Shoot! We’re out of soda.",
        "Really?!",
        "Sweety, what are you talking about?",
        "Oh.",
        "Ennnh.",
        "(screaming in pain) Ow!! Ow!!!",
        "Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!",
        "It’s like two miles!",
        "Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!",
        "What?! What is it?!",
        "What?!! Gross!!",
        "Well forget it! It doesn’t hurt that (tries to take a step) baaad!!!!",
        "Nothing, I don’t know.",
        "Nothing. I’m gonna take a shower.",
        "Pass the cheese, please.",
        "My God, you can’t even look at me! Can you?",
        "What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.",
        "(stopping him) No! Joey, we swore we’d never tell!",
        "(interrupting) All right!! All right. (walks slowly into the living room) I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn’t stand. I-I couldn’t walk.",
        "I was in too much pain.",
        "You can’t say that!! You-you don’t know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn’t...bend that way. So... (looks at Joey.)",
        "You bet.",
        "Hey!!",
        "(sets down some cards) Gin.",
        "Will you stop!",
        "Okay, all right, I think you’re great, I think you’re sweet, and you’re smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.",
        "Yesss!!",
        "Shhh!",
        "Chip, is Chip Matthews.",
        "‘Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.",
        "I know!! (calls him) (on phone) Chip? Hi! It’s Monica. (listens) ‘Kay. (listens) ‘Kay. (listens) Okay. (listens) Okay, good-bye. (hangs up) Oh my God, we just had the best conversation!! (goes into her room as Rachel enters)",
        "Hey!",
        "Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?",
        "What, that little thing at the prom?",
        "Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?",
        "Look, you and I went to different high schools...",
        "You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip’s motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.",
        "It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.",
        "Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he’s-he’s called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.",
        "Oh, really?!",
        "I’ll try.",
        "Why can’t you use the phone in here?",
        "Ross, don’t start.",
        "Oh, but it’s made her so happy.",
        "He is right, isn’t he?",
        "Hi!",
        "(sliding into Joey’s place on the couch to try and talk to Phoebe) Huh? What’d ya say Joe? I’ll be right there. (gets up and joins Joey)",
        "(running from the bathroom to her room, wearing only a towel) Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! (gets to her room and closes the door, as Rachel gets up to answer the door.)",
        "Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!",
        "That’s what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you’re Chip. Nevermind.",
        "Wow! A lipper from Chipper.",
        "Umm. Well, there’s Rachel, and umm, I think that’s it. How bout you?",
        "Is that all?",
        "Ohh, how is he?",
        "Isn’t he an architect now?",
        "Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, ‘cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don’t even know where you work?",
        "I do?",
        "You still work at the multiplex?",
        "Thanks, I’m set. Do you still live with your parents?",
        "(entering) Oh my God! What happened?",
        "Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?",
        "Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.",
        "No, it’s okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.",
        "I know!",
        "Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.",
        "Me too. (they all leave)",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "You’re not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over...",
        "So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm...",
        "(Robin is speaking loudly again) I...",
        "Forget it. (they all turn and listen to Billy and Robin)",
        "(pause) I have no idea.",
        "He didn’t ask me to marry him.",
        "He wanted to tell me he’s gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.",
        "I don’t know exactly. It’s-it’s sorta like wrestling.",
        "Yeah, but without the costumes.",
        "So you can like, bite, and pull people’s hair and stuff?",
        "What’s fish hooking?",
        "I gotta tell ya, I think it’s okay to be that guy.",
        "Okay, can we please go eat?",
        "(to Chandler) Anything but stew.",
        "(entering) Hi!",
        "Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don’t want you to get hurt, ‘cause I kinda like you.",
        "Promise me you’ll be careful.",
        "Hey, are we still on for tonight?",
        "Okay, good, ‘cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...",
        "How ‘bout just a boom?",
        "God Ross, what is that?",
        "I love you, Pete!!!",
        "(going up to the ring) Pete! Pete!! That guy’s pretty huge!",
        "Hey! (she sits down next to him) It’s me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.",
        "I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.",
        "Well, you’re not gonna get going are you?",
        "Well, no. But...",
        "That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!",
        "You didn’t know that already?",
        "Okay, just get a lot better. (pause) Fast.",
        "Yeah. That-that was the problem.",
        "(joining them) Hey.",
        "Oh, about five minutes. Right now they’re interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.",
        "Four, please. (Ross looks at her) I’m really nervous. (Ross gives her the four dogs) Thank you. (she grabs four buns, and heads back inside)",
        "Please tell me you’re stopping now.",
        "You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!",
        "Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!",
        "Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you’re gonna have to do it without me.",
        "Then I’ve gotta go. Bye. (kisses him and starts to walk out)",
        "Yes?",
        "Really?!",
        "Joey, she was listing the countries she’s done it in.",
        "(watching a happy couple walk by, arm in arm) Would you look\n        at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die\n        an old maid.",
        "(sarcastic) Thanks!",
        "Yeah right.",
        "You made a joke right? So I laughed.",
        "Well, no. You’re Chandler. Y'know, Chandler! (hits him on the\n        arm)",
        "Well I’d probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.",
        "Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!",
        "Seriously, where did you get the hat?",
        "What’s with all this sand? (picking a handful of sand off of\n        the floor, which is covered in sand)",
        "What?!",
        "What are you crazy?!",
        "Aww, thank you.",
        "(to Phoebe) So what’s Phoebe like?",
        "Ah no, the other Phoebe, the one you went to go see.",
        "Oh well, where is he?!",
        "(gasps) Totally familiar. (Phoebe shows the rest of them.)",
        "Well, why would she lie to you?",
        "Strip Happy Days Game?",
        "I think I’ll help her out. (She gets up to go over and help\n        Rachel, and reveals she has no pants.) (to Rachel) What is\n        going on here?",
        "You painting his toenails?",
        "Chasing him all around the room?",
        "He’s totally flirting with you too.",
        "Huh?",
        "You didn’t even take off your pants.",
        "What?",
        "Like a log.",
        "That’s that weird voice again.",
        "Rachel!",
        "You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!",
        "Have you ever taken out the trash? (Hands her the garbage.)",
        "Third door on the left.",
        "God! If you’re gonna cry about it! (She grabs the box and goes to through it out.]",
        "Joey, please don’t do that. I think it’s best that we just forget about it.",
        "(Picking up a card from Chandler’s wallet.) My God! Is this a gym card?",
        "What’s the matter?",
        "So do them for free.",
        "Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.",
        "You’re gonna do some feet flirtin’!",
        "What a minute, what did he say?",
        "I told you not to go down there!",
        "Rachel always cries!",
        "Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you’ve never sucked before!",
        "His dancing partner?!",
        "Oh, would you let it go already?! You’re fine!",
        "Wait, now so you joined the gym?",
        "Well, you could actually go to the gym.",
        "Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.",
        "Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?",
        "Yes you did! You did like a little hop.",
        "(laughing harder) You know the words! You are so into this!",
        "All right, then show me some manly moves.",
        "So you didn’t leave the bank?",
        "Oh my Gosh!",
        "(Entering from her bedroom) How desperate am I?",
        "I just told my Mom I’d cater a party for her.",
        "Because I need the money, and I thought that it’d be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.",
        "You don’t have to stick up for her. She can’t here you.",
        "Doing great, the quiches are coming along.",
        "Yeah, I thought it was cute.",
        "Let me ask you a question.",
        "Why did you hire me?",
        "(to Phoebe) Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I’m good.",
        "Oh yeah, she didn’t hire me out of pity, it wasn’t so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I’m good.",
        "…I think he deserves a Nobel Prize. (Joey starts to nod ‘Yes.’)",
        "What?",
        "Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn’t give me grief about me biting them.",
        "(Looks at her nails) Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put… (realises) Oh my God! It’s in the quiche! Oh My God!",
        "Okay ah, please don’t freak out. Umm, but ah, there’s a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there’s no way to know which one.",
        "Then why are you laughing?",
        "What? You bet I’d lose a nail?",
        "Frozen lasagnas?",
        "You bet that I’d screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was…",
        "You promised Dr. Weinburg, you’d never use that phrase.",
        "(laughs) That’s right. My Mom doesn’t have any faith in me! Oh, that’s hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.",
        "(interrupting) No! You have lasagnas! (Storms out and an awkward silence follows.)",
        "Hi.",
        "Ohh, I’m such an idiot. I can’t believe I actually thought she could change.",
        "Oh good, I’m glad that’s catching on.",
        "What?",
        "(getting up) All right, I’ll go down there. But, I’m not gonna serve the lasagna. I’m gonna serve something I make.",
        "Well?",
        "Really?!",
        "Yes!!",
        "And you?",
        "So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you…",
        "Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.",
        "Wow!",
        "That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don’t bite your nails.",
        "(in a sexy voice) Hello, Chandler. (Phoebe has a huge smile on her face.)",
        "Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?",
        "Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War? (Joey is pissed)",
        "Just go up to her and ask her out. (Chandler laughs) Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?",
        "Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.",
        "Just be yourself. But, not too much.",
        "That cold makes you sound so great.",
        "Y'know what, I like Kathy.",
        "Monica:",
        "(turning around and doing that, \"I'm making out with someone,\" thing with her hands) Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh! (She turns around and sees Gunther staring at her and stops suddenly.)",
        "Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?",
        "Hey!",
        "Rachel's not here.",
        "How's it going with her?",
        "Hi, Josh.",
        "So, did you play in college? (She points to his NYU Soccer (football for the rest of the world) sweatshirt he's wearing.)",
        "Very!",
        "It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.",
        "Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.",
        "Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.",
        "(sneezes) Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.",
        "(lying on the couch suffering from her cold) Ross isn't here.",
        "What?",
        "Why?",
        "Thank you so much Phoebe.",
        "What are you doing with those?!",
        "Sorry, Phoebe.",
        "Umm. (nodding her head, \"Good.\")",
        "Ohhhh!! Gross!!",
        "No, sorry.",
        "Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?",
        "Ross, cough drops, please?",
        "(interrupting) You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!",
        "And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'",
        "That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!",
        "Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.",
        "He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, \"The Sound.\"",
        "Yeah!",
        "(At a loss for words) Boy, that was-that was, umm… terrific.",
        "Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!",
        "(to Rachel and Phoebe) Y'know, there’s a Starbucks about three blocks down.",
        "(to Phoebe) Hey, aren’t you up next?",
        "Phoebe, Ross sucks!",
        "Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.",
        "Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!",
        "Are you serious?",
        "You obviously haven’t screwed over a lot of your friends. (They all look at her) Which we all appreciate.",
        "He loves you.",
        "I remember you did.",
        "(removing ear plugs) What?",
        "Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.",
        "Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?",
        "(Entering from her bedroom, talking on the phone) Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. (To the gang) I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.",
        "Sixty guests.",
        "Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.",
        "I don't know.",
        "Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.",
        "Well, you're not working either.",
        "Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you!",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow--the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!",
        "Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. (Picks up two frying pans) Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!",
        "Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look--I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh, is everything in the car?",
        "No. I hate this part.",
        "No, that's not mine.",
        "Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.",
        "Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...",
        "Just the matter of ...payment?",
        "Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.",
        "What?",
        "Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?",
        "Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.",
        "Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!",
        "I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.",
        "Oh, that's great! Congratulations!",
        "Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.",
        "And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.",
        "Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!",
        "I can cook and you can take care of the money.",
        "Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister.",
        "Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?",
        "No?",
        "We haven’t eaten yet!",
        "Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.",
        "Who cares? He works in a museum!",
        "What is wrong with this freezer?! (She jabs her arm into the freezer and a piece of ice flies into her eye.) Ow! Ow!!",
        "Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!",
        "Oh, y’know what, I can’t, it really kills.",
        "No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can’t go to him when I don’t have a boyfriend!",
        "Like I remember his office number! (Pause) Speed dial 7.",
        "Yes!!",
        "Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?",
        "Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.",
        "I was probably waiting for it to open.",
        "You look great too.",
        "So how does it look?",
        "Like a pirate?!",
        "Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? (He looks at her) Come on, one of us had to mention him.",
        "Oh. Big family dinner tonight?",
        "No way!",
        "(disappointed) Oh.",
        "(happy) Oh.",
        "(sympathetic) Oh. (in a pirate’s voice) So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?",
        "I know.",
        "Why is it sick?",
        "Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don’t you?",
        "Me going out with Richard’s son.",
        "Fine! Judge all you want to but, (points to Ross) married a lesbian, (points to Rachel) left a man at the altar, (points to Phoebe) fell in love with a gay ice dancer, (points to Joey) threw a girl’s wooden leg in a fire, (points to Chandler) livin’ in a box!! (goes to her room)",
        "(running in from her bedroom) I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! (opens the door) Hi, Tim.",
        "Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.",
        "And Joey.",
        "My brother, Ross.",
        "And Rachel. (Chandler clears his voice loudly) And that’s Chandler.",
        "Umm, well, he’s…",
        "All right everybody, this turkey is ready!",
        "Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.",
        "See he’s nice. Right?",
        "I saved you a seat. (Motions to the one next to her.)",
        "Oh-ho-ho, we’ve got company.",
        "(putting off her coat) Ooh, this always happens. (Her coat gets stuck.)",
        "Thank you.",
        "Y’know all my friends think this is weird.",
        "I know! I mean it’s like me and your dad, that’s a totally separate thing.",
        "We’re just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?",
        "Nothing. Nothing.",
        "No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss…",
        "(interrupting) Don’t say it!",
        "Yeah!",
        "I know!",
        "Oh, he’s catching up to her!",
        "Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.",
        "I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this (puts on her chef hat) on my chef’s hat. (The hat says ‘Quit, bitch’)",
        "I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me. (Joey laughs and Monica glares at him.)",
        "I mean they’re trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I’ve been waiting for my whole life.",
        "I would love too, but I can’t! I mean I just can’t, you know that I’m not good at confrontation.",
        "That’s a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?",
        "All right, you’re hired!",
        "Didn’t your dad used to call you Pumpkin?",
        "(getting up) All right, I’m gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?",
        "You want a problem? I’ll give you a problem!",
        "You bet your ass, I’m gonna fire you! Thank you.",
        "Hey.",
        "They baked it. I can’t take this anymore. I’m gonna call a meeting tonight, I’m gonna fire you tonight.",
        "What are you doing?!",
        "Thanks. (Joey’s still patting the burn spot) I think you got it!",
        "Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?",
        "Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight’s specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag—Why is nobody writing these down?",
        "Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?",
        "Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here’s the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, (quietly) tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere…",
        "(louder) A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. (She holds her hand over her head as an afterthought.) From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! (Joey looks at the money he’s holding, and doesn’t speak up.) Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!",
        "What the hell happened?!",
        "Joey, we had a deal. That-that’s why you’re here! I’ve got to fire you!",
        "What kinda things have you been saying?",
        "I need more swordfish. (to one of the assistant chefs) Can you get me some more swordfish?",
        "You did a minute ago!",
        "Fine!",
        "Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I’m cold! (She spills something.) And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out! (the door opens)",
        "That’s not funny.",
        "(starting to cry) I’m a good person. And I’m a good chef, and I don’t deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y’know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is…",
        "You do?",
        "Well if you want a problem? I’ll give you a problem!",
        "You bet your ass I’m gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!! (Joey leaves) All right! Anybody else got a problem? How ‘bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?",
        "How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it’s funny now?",
        "Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, (to the kitchen worker from earlier) And you! Get the swordfish! (to another assistant chef) And you! Get a haircut!",
        "Thanks.",
        "Enough!",
        "Come on, no peeking! (They are leading the gang out with there hands over their eyes.)",
        "All right, umm, we’re not gonna really keep it this way though.",
        "(to Phoebe) Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?",
        "Well, I’m gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.",
        "Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence… dozens of people.",
        "Oh no-no-no, it’s only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.",
        "Oh.",
        "All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?",
        "Hey! My first review is out!",
        "All right, look at my on the back page.",
        "Hey, they don’t pay me a penny a word to make friends.",
        "Oh! Do you need me to go with you?",
        "Haven’t we made this decision?",
        "Bye!",
        "(answering it) Who is it?",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Oh my God, oh my God. (on intercom) Call me on the phone!",
        "Look, I-I’m never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.",
        "No! Phoebe!",
        "I couldn’t eat it! I had five friends who couldn’t eat it, and one of them eats books.",
        "The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!",
        "All right, that I’ll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn’t it. You’re marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.",
        "Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?",
        "Hand me those tomatoes, I’m gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.",
        "Okay, the owner of Allesandro’s came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!",
        "Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!",
        "You got the job?! Why didn’t you tell me?",
        "Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. (Rachel excuses herself) Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.",
        "I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it’s snowballing, y’know?",
        "I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro’s.",
        "It’s okay, ‘cause y'know what? You don’t really need me for the business.",
        "All right. But umm, I-I-I’ll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.",
        "Phoebe, wait a minute! (runs after her, leaving Rachel alone)",
        "(entering) Ohh, here you are. Y’know, I’m-I’m glad you decided to hear me out.",
        "I’ve been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.",
        "Or! A bakery delivery person.",
        "Pizza?!",
        "All right, I’ve got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I’m getting the feeling that you don’t want to deliver.",
        "Okay. I’m guessing that if you don’t want to deliver, you probably don’t want to pick stuff up either.",
        "Y’know what, let’s do the catering business.",
        "Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y’know what, it’d be, it’d be fun.",
        "Really?!",
        "Thank you.",
        " Umm, I just wanna say, uh (reads from a 3 X 5 card) that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... (Looks up and sees eveyone glaring at her) Are you gonna kill me?",
        "(not wanting to be left out, picks up something) Hey umm, what’s this?",
        "Hey, Joey, I don’t think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it’s only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?",
        "What’s Phase Two?",
        "You stink!",
        "Uh-oh, what’s the matter?",
        "I don’t know sweetie.",
        "I can’t! I have to work!",
        "No, Chandler’s still in Phase One, and Joey’s that thing you smell.",
        "I think she’s here.",
        "(looking out the peephole) Ohh, she’s looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can’t see people through that little hole, can you? (Goes back to the door.) Hello!",
        "I-I-I think you look great.",
        "What?",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Oh wait, Joey, you can’t go like that! You stink!",
        "Yeah. Run ten blocks, that’ll help the smell.",
        "So? How did it go with Joshua last night?",
        "What?",
        "So you hit her in the face?",
        "Hey! You’re wearing pants!",
        "It’s 9:30 in the morning!",
        "Hello. (Listens) Oh, hey Ross!",
        "Oh-oh, my God!",
        "(to Chandler) Shh!! (On phone) Wait, what?",
        "He’s with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!",
        "He had to go, there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.",
        "Why do you care so much anyway?",
        "Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.",
        "A couple of days.",
        "What are you doing?! Chandler! You can’t just go back a phase!",
        "Yeah, come on, we can be guys!",
        "(coming back to the stage and sitting next to Chandler) Okay, I’ve got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?",
        "Very good, (getting up and sliding a One into the dancer’s hot pants) so good.",
        "(to the waitress) When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.",
        "Oh! And don’t let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.",
        "I think somebody needs another lap dance. (Motions for one.)",
        "So, we did okay at the strip club, right?",
        "What, he doesn’t like Josh?",
        "Yeah. And y’know, if you wanna cry, that’s okay too.",
        "Come on! Chandler!",
        "They really were pretty, weren’t they? (Rachel and Phoebe both agree)",
        "Oh, Candy! She was so spunky!",
        "Y’know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. (Chandler is intrigued.) It’d, it’d be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.",
        "Oh, Chantal!",
        "Really?!",
        "That’s-that’s not Phase Three.",
        "Hey!",
        "Wait, now, what am I doing again?",
        "No, you've messed it up. You're stupid.",
        "Are you serious?",
        "What did you tell them?",
        "Yeah, I mean you'd be pregnant. I mean, pregnant.",
        "We just want you to think it through.",
        "In the beginning, you know, where it's all s*x and talking and s*x and talking...",
        "And the s*x?",
        "Then what is it?",
        "Big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends. That doesn't mean he's good in bed.",
        "Sweetie, with you it's going to be different. The s*x is going to be great 'cause you guys are in love.",
        "I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me. [Rachel puts her arm consolingly around Monica]",
        "What?",
        "[to Chandler] So, did you do it?",
        "Uh-oh, was it bad?",
        "Well, it was the first time. You know, there's not always a lot of agreement on the first time.",
        "All right, I'm going to show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, hand me that pad over there. [Rach gets a pad and pen off the table and hands it to Monica.] All right. Now...[starts to draw]",
        "Now, everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got, [starts labelling her diagram] one, two, three, [Chandler nods impatiently], four [now Chandle looks up, surprised], five, six, and seven.",
        "[chuckles] Kind of an important one.",
        "Okay, now, most guys will hit one, two, and three and then go to seven and set up camp.",
        "All right, uh the important thing is to take your time. You want to hit them all and you want to mix them up. You got to keep them on their toes.",
        "Okay, you could, uh, start with a little one; a two; a one, two, three; a three; a five; a four, a three-two; a two, a two-four-six; [Monica starts to get into it ] two-four-six; four [Rachel kind of moves back and stretches out] a two; [Monica now has her eyes closed and is getting visibly excited] two; four-seven; five-seven [Chandler looks away from both of them as if he can't believe what's happening]; six-seven; seven, seven, [faster] SEVEN, SEVEN, SEVEN-SEVEN-SEVEN-SEVEN-[Chandler looks at her in disbelief] SEVEN-SEVEN! [Monica, eyes still closed, leans back and shudders and says silently, while holding up seven fingers, \"seven\".]",
        "You know, I never saw that.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "[to Phoebe] It's going to be so great.",
        "Would you surrogate?",
        "What if I asked?",
        "Really?",
        "No.",
        "Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?",
        "Didn’t it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?",
        "They wouldn’t have put it there if it didn’t do something! How can you not care?",
        "Janice?!",
        "How have you been?",
        "Done?",
        "This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don’t work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.",
        "Yeah, well, I’m using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. (She flips on the switch and a hum starts.) I hear something! I hear something! Where is it? (They all start looking until Rachel realises it’s Joey.)",
        "He asked you out?!",
        "Saucy!",
        "Electrical plans for the building.",
        "I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they’d brighten up the place. They do don’t you think?",
        "No-no-no, no!",
        "I know that there’s no hole there, I just really liked that picture.",
        "Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!",
        "I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.",
        "No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.",
        "But it didn’t. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.",
        "All right. The super couldn’t figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn’t figure out what it did. I’ve had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.",
        "I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.",
        "Boy, you are really not a morning person.",
        "What kind of changes?",
        "Oh, good luck.",
        "That is sooo not true!",
        "I just—I can’t believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Deal!",
        "Ha-ha!",
        "Aww, man!",
        "That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.",
        "Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.",
        "Are you scared?",
        "Ross will do it.",
        "You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?",
        "Same category?",
        "Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!",
        "No!!",
        "I knew that! Rachel! Use you’re head!",
        "Viva Las Gaygas!",

        "How about we play for more money, say 150?",
        "You’re doing it again.",
        "We won’t. (to Chandler) 300?",
        "I’m just trying to spice it up!",
        "I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?",
        "Deal!",
        "Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand. (Holds up her hand.)",

        "How do you feel?",
        "Really?! How much?!",
        "Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would’ve made them get rid of the birds. Right?",
        "All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it’s all your fault.",
        "Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!",
        "Well?",

        "Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?",
        "Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just…(Rachel grunts and throws her purse at it)…throw your purses at it.",
        "Oh my God, are you out of a job?",
        "Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can’t eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.",

        "You used to have carpet.",

        "Good evening. I’m Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as (proudly) Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, (looks for a reaction from his students, and gets none.) I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don’t have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this. (looks all intense for a moment and then gasps, the students cheer him) Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along.",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, ’Hey, the bell doesn’t dismiss you, I dismiss you.’",

        "Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I’ve never been able to cry as an actor, so if I’m in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let’s say I wanna convey that I’ve just done something evil. That would be the basic ‘I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it’ (Does it by raising one eyebrow, and showing off the pretend fishhook.) Okay, let’s say I’ve just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. (looks all confused) And that’s how it’s done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.",

        "(sadly) There will come a time in each of your careers when you’ll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I’m ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he’s got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I’m stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. (he gets a huge round of applause from his students.) Thank you.",

        "No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. (walks into the kitchen, Chandler follows closely, he turns around and gets startled). Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair (holds his hands up to signify she has big hair)?",
        "Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.",

        "Look, what do you want me to say?",

        "But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.",
        "No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.",
        "Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.",

        "Calm down, do you want this unit or not?",

        "Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.",
        "Nothing. It’s just old and dingy, that’s all.",
        "Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. (Monica gasps) Yeah.",
        "Relax. Here hold this (hands her his beer). This old stuff just comes right off. (he bends down to try and lift some tile right in the middle of the floor, in his tight pants.)",
        "(manages to pry off only a small piece) Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It’d take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it. (starts to walk away, but Monica grabs him)",

        "Why don’t we just go on two.",
        "Because it’s faster.",
        "All right, but in the future...",
        "So we are going on two?",
        "Wow, it’s big!",
        "Maybe, my ruler’s wrong.",
        "Look it’s not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.",
        "Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.",
        "Y'know what?",

        "And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.",
        "What? Me having a job?",
        "Well, I’m pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.",

        "Great, you can cover Chandler.",
        "Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.",
        "Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it’ll take your mind off Janice, and if you don’t play, everyone will be mad at you ‘cause the teams won’t be even. Come on.",
        "Says who? Your mom?",
        "All right, we have to pick captains.",
        "What?",
        "Thank you.",

        "I think so.",
        "Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.",
        "Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I’ll let you have her.",
        "Well I don’t like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don’t feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You’re better with numbers and stuff.",
        "Fumble!",
        "What the hell’s the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.",
        "All right, that’s it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.",

        "(on TV, finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is\n      easy. (starts to poor the milk) Now, I can have milk everyday.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't\n      show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first\n      good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the\n      message?!",
        "How is it you?",
        "Yep, that's my audition.",
        "Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her\n      that I missed my chance.",
        "Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to\n      friends, she only talks to agents.",
        "What, what are you doing? What are you doing?",
        "Hang up, hang up. (reaches with his good arm, but Phoebe grabs\n      it and he tries to reach the phone with his other arm but can't\n      because of the sling.)",
        "I love that movie. (Joey is using it as a pillow)",
        "I'm sorry, it just felt nice.",
        "Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing\n      stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.",
        "Hey, you know about that?!",
        "Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I\n      understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than\n      one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much\n      like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of\n      heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of\n      bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of\n      commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed\n      guy there ever was.",
        "Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the\n      barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!",
        "Come on baby, come on!",
        "Thank you so much.",
        "You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see\n      there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and\n      Estelle couldn't get me in.",
        "Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's\n      two.",
        "Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at\n      it. I love you.",
        "Nooo, four.",
        "(entering) G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?",
        "Pheebs! There you are!",
        "But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe! (catches her in the\n      hallway)",
        "Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything?\n      I think I got a shot at it.",
        "It's okay, these things happen.",
        "I'm, I'm okay. See. (tries to smile, but fails horribly)",
        "No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had!\n      Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it\n      personally.",
        "They actually said that?",
        "No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents\n      always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went\n      another way', but this, I can use this. (in a very bad Italian\n      accent) I canna work on a new accent.",
        "Okay, shoot.",
        "I didn't get it?",
        "Okay, what else?",
        "Oh.",
        "Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really\n      appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to\n      Estelle.",
        "Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she\n      is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb\n      brains out.",
        "You do, thanks.",
        "Wait a minute.",
        "Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get\n      out of being my agent.",
        "(in a really, really bad Italian accent) That's-ah what I\n      suspected-ah.",
        "(entering with Monica) Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?",
        "Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way\n      would be, to not.",
        "It’ll kill him. I mean it’ll, it’ll just kill him.",
        "(looking out the window) Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his\n      new hammock. It’s like a Play-Doo Fat Factory. ",
        "What did they do?",
        "Hey-hey, Ross?",
        "I’ve got a science question.",
        "If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact ‘Homo-sapien’, is that why\n      there extinct?",
        "Hey-hey, I’m not judging.",
        "I’d really prefer a mountain bike.",
        "Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her\n      something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her\n      gum, girls love gum.",
        "Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do,\n      you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead\n      serious.",
        "(stopping him) No, no, you can’t, you can’t, okay, you can’t,\n      you can’t buy her pearls, you just can’t, you can’t, you can’t.",
        "Oh God. Uh, okay, here’s the thing, this is the thing, okay, the\n      thing is...",
        "Okay. I went down to the ‘Mattress King’ showroom and,\n      and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.",
        "They were in his office.",
        "I’m telling you man, I saw it.",
        "I’m not wrong! I wish I was. I’m sorry. Bet that barium enema\n      doesn’t sound so bad now, huh?",
        "You said number two.",
        "I know. (giggles harder)",
        "Uh.",
        "Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still. (Phoebe runs to the\n      window and gasps.)",
        "I’m tellin’ ya, he hasn’t moved since this morning.",
        "Well, there is one way. His window’s open, I say, we poke\n      him.",
        "Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no\n      reason we get when we get Chinese food?",
        "Well, now we got a reason.",
        "Well, we’re fashioning a very long poking device.",
        "Hey uh, what’s a matter?",
        "Oh my God, is she going back to him?",
        "What are you ah, what are you gonna do?",
        "Well, it doesn’t matter what I would do.",
        "All right, you’re probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if\n      it was me, and this is just me, (Chandler gets ready to throw\n      another dart) I would ah, I would bow out.",
        "They have a kid together, y'know. They’re like, they’re like a\n      family, and if, I don’t know, there’s chance they could make that\n      work, I know I wouldn’t want to be the guy who stood in the way\n      of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?",
        "All right now remember, something this big and long is going to\n      be difficult to manouver, fortunately I have a lot of experience\n      in that area.",
        "All right, ladies and gentlemen, let’s poke. (they start to\n      advance the giant poking device) Steady. Steady. Okay, a little\n      higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, we’re approaching the\n      window (as he says this the camera cuts to their view of Ugly\n      Naked Guy, so that we actually see him!) Thread the needle.\n      Thread the needle. ",
        "Okay, retract the device, retract the device.",
        "Hey, that’s never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!",
        "Okay, pick a card, any card. (Monica picks one) All right, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it?",
        "All right, give it back to me. (takes the card back, but he looks at the card before he puts it back in the deck, he holds the deck to his forehead, and thinks a little while) 5 of hearts.",
        "I can’t tell you that, no.",
        "All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I’ll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn’t see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. (picks up a card and quickly looks at it) I just did it. (does it again) I just did it, again. Here, I’ll slow it down so that you guys can see it. (looks and the card in slow motion)",
        "Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.",
        "Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....",
        "I don’t know, Chandler is supposed to be passin’ ‘em around...",
        "Chandler!",
        "Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.",
        "No, only for s*x.",
        "Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!",
        "(angrily entering, to Chandler) Can I talk to you for a second?!",
        "Come on!! (motions for Chandler to come with him)",
        "I just got off the phone with my sister.",
        "Mary-Angela.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Why don’t you ask Chandler, ‘cause he’s the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin’ over Janice by groping my sister.",
        "Really? That’s great! You and my sister, sittin’ in a tree.",
        "Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?",
        "You are so the man! (motions him to come in, and he does) Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, ‘cause my Grandma doesn’t know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.",
        "She’s right in there. (motions to the living room)",
        "What’s goin’ on?",
        "What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?",
        "Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you’d be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!",
        "No! No! No! No, I’m not going to punch Chandler.",
        "No you won’t. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he’s sorry. But, (to Chandler) you’ve got one more apology to make, all right, you’ve got to apologize to Mary-Angela.",
        "All right.",
        "Cookie, now you can punch him!",
        "All right, that’s it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. (gets up) This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! (stops and turns around and asks Rachel) But, is he a big guy?",
        "Wow! This girl is good.",
        "(to Leslie) So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.",
        "(to Leslie) Ah, anything we might of heard of?",
        "(joining in) Home is Home Star stew.",
        "(to Phoebe) Wow, that was kinda brutal.",
        "Ah, he can’t make it, he said he had to his... (sees Ginger) Whoa-oh! (hides behind the coat rack.)",
        "Phew, close one.",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "Is ah, is Chandler around?",
        "Oooh.",
        "Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn’t something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?",
        "Aww, man. That’s the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he’s my roommate, she’s gonna tell him what I did.",
        "What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can’t, I can’t tell you that, it’s like the most awful, horrible thing I’ve ever done my whole life.",
        "All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad’s cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....",
        "I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.",
        "I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should’ve told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.",
        "I ran!!",
        "(entering from his bedroom) Morning.",
        "(to Chandler) Heard about the leg burnin’ huh?",
        "Listen, I ah, I know it’s a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?",
        "Yeah. You okay?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Where have you been?",
        "(Voice Over) Previously on Friends.",
        "Yeah. We figured when we couldn’t find you, you’d gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?",
        "Look, Ross look, I’m on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that’s gonna get you in trouble.",
        "Yeah, and there won’t be a relationship left to rebuild.",
        "All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn’t find out some other way. (spins the chair around so that Ross is facing him) Did you think about the trail?",
        "(stomps on the footrest which pops Ross up into a sitting position) The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! (slapping his hands with each word) You always have to think about the trail!",
        "Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that’s all. I mean, come on, it’s just a little wax.",
        "Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?",
        "Don’t answer that.",
        "Awful! Horrible!",
        "She was nothing compared to you.",
        "Ewwwww!",
        "Y'know what, I don’t think we should listen to this anymore. (Goes to open the door)",
        "Why not?! (to Chandler) I’m hungry.",
        "Yeah, we’ll be fine.",
        "Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. (makes like he is trying to send a telepathic message to Rachel) Put olives on the pizza.",
        "You think I need a new walk?",
        "Well y'know, I’ve been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a ‘take notice’ walk.",
        "Whoa-ho-ho! (He looks at Chandler, who gives him a ‘come on’ look.) Yeah, okay.",
        "Maybe she killed him?",
        "(whispering) No, I really have to pee.",
        "Can I see the comics?",
        "Okay, may I see the comics?",
        "Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.",
        "Well Ross was hangin’ out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....",
        "Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.",
        "Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.",
        "I had the same dream!",
        "Oh, I had the opposite dream.",
        "Yeah, I mean it’s never taken me a week to get over a relationship.",
        "Rach, it’s, it’s ah, it’s not that we don’t want to, really. (quietly) Are we talking models in their underwear?",
        "(He turns around to Chandler looking for approval to go with Rachel, Chandler mouths ‘Come on!’) (turning back to Rachel) Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "You’re smoking again?!",
        "(obviously cold) Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here!",
        "It’ll be great for next weekend.",
        "It’ll be great for next weekend. I mean, (in an Irish accent) it’ll be grrreat.",
        "Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother’s cab, but y'know what, I’ll stay.",
        "(to Chandler and Monica) Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?",
        "What? Mine aren’t tinted.",
        "Oh, now I have to go!!",
        "What’s going on?",
        "Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?",
        "Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!",
        "Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?",
        "Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.",
        "If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.",
        "Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.",
        "(opening the door) And there you go!",
        "Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.",
        "Okay, done.",
        "That’s ‘help’ spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!",
        "Hey!!",
        "Arrrghh!!",
        "Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?",
        "No, I wasn’t gonna ask you that, no.",
        "I-I can’t handle this, you guys.",
        "(pause) What?",
        "(pause) What?",
        "Yeah, and not put us in the middle.",
        "Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who’s going with who?",
        "Come on man, you drove all the way up here.",
        "(to Phoebe) Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?",
        "Cool.",
        "Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you’ll probably be hungry after the s*x.",
        "Hey.",
        "Check the freezer. If there’s none in there, then we’re probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It’s late.",
        "I discovered I’m able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.",
        "Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.",
        "Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we’ve got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.",
        "Haven’t you ever read the same book over and over again?",
        "The question should be Rach, what is not so great about The Shining. Okay? And the answer would be: nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it’s way better than that classic of yours.",
        "All right, you got it.",
        "Okay.",
        "Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.",
        "How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?",
        "These little women. Wow!",
        "Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo’s manuscript. I don’t see how he could ever forgive her.",
        "But Jo’s got a crush on Laurie. (Ross nods his head) Oh. You mean it’s like a girl-girl thing? ‘Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.",
        "No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.",
        "(noticing Chandler) What are you doing? (he pushes Chandler back to his side of the couch) Get back over on your side of the... (sees Robert in all his glory) Hello!! (to Robert) Hi, I’m Joey, we haven’t met.",
        "Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?",
        "Hey! (starts to laugh.) How’s it going?",
        "Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?",
        "Oooh, the next part’s the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...",
        "All right I’ll talk in code. (to Ross and Chandler) Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?",
        "Oh, all blank, and no blank, make’s blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!",
        "Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.",
        "Beth, Beth dies?",
        "Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?",
        "Then why would you say that?!",
        "Beth is really, really sick.",
        "Jo’s there, but I don’t think there’s anything she could do.",
        "Yeah.",
        "(nodding his head) Okay.",
        "Oh, nothing, no. It’s an acting exercise, I’m practising my fake laugh.",
        "What-what’s so funny?",
        "Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.",
        "Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.",
        "Well, have-have you told him how you feel?",
        "No-no-no-no-no. (They start to turn away, but Phoebe stops them, and turns them back to face her.)",
        "No.",
        "So, we’re walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, “Hey, let’s go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,” remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, “Nah, let’s just hang out at your place.” Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.",
        "Yeah, come on, think about it. You’re 18, okay, she’s 44, when you’re 36, she’s gonna be 88.",
        "Look, the point is, there’s a lot of women out there you haven’t even had s*x with yet!",
        "Yeah, in a poem maybe.",
        "Now, wh-what, what is that like?",
        "(to Ross) Why can’t I find that?",
        "Well, I want it!",
        "I don’t know, maybe I can’t. I mean, maybe there’s something wrong with me.",
        "Then you hold on to it!!",
        "All right, congratulations you lucky b*st*rd! (hugs him)",
        "I couldn’t help it, there love is so pure.",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?",
        "Every night!!",
        "(He’s recorded his voice on the tape) Joey’s your best friEnd. You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. (he laughs) And you also want to buy him hundreds of dollars worth of pants.",
        "(to Monica) Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?",
        "Done.",
        "So Pheebs what’s this guy like?",
        "Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?",
        "Yeah!",
        "Uh, y'know what, we’re having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we’ll need a little more time to think about it.",
        "Both of us? (points to Chandler and himself)",
        "We’ll be there.",
        "Uh, 10:30.",
        "4:30.",
        "Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?",
        "She was kidding about that right?",
        "God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?",
        "Dude, I don’t know.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don’t want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don’t want to be seeing.",
        "Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... (clears throat) y'know each would, (clears throat again) y'know (pause) be?",
        "Yeah, I guess, but what’s like heads and what’s tails?",
        "So what are you gonna do?",
        "Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.",
        "Nothing, he’s just really believes in that.",
        "(entering, dancing and singing) Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! (He dances around the dinner table and exits)",
        "Good. (He sets his stuff down and starts talking to Kate, another cast member.) Hey.",
        "Oh, so you’re playing Adrienne, huh?",
        "Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I’m Joey Tribianni.",
        "So the ah, play’s pretty great, huh?",
        "Oh, forget about it. She rocks!",
        "Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.",
        "Hey, I’ve done plays before. I’m a serious actor.",
        "See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn’t. Now, see, that’s acting.",
        "Yeah, that was real.",
        "I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can’t do it, they’re all like-like laughing at me.",
        "Hey!",
        "Wow, what-what do you think she wants?",
        "Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.",
        "Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?",
        "Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and nothin’. You look at me, and it’s nothin’. (He kisses her) Nothing.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it’s says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don’t know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you’re a bitch.",
        "It does in mine!",
        "Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she’s like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!",
        "God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, ‘Oh, I’m so talented.’ and ‘Oh, I’m so pretty,’ and ‘Ooh, I smell so good.’",
        "Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?",
        "Oh. (realises) Ohh. Ohh, you’re out of your mind.",
        "Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!",
        "Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and it’s nothin’. You look at me, and nothin’. (He kisses her, more passionately this time) Nothing.",
        "Better?",
        "Ah, Kate?",
        "You ah, you forgot your shoes.",
        "Hey, listen you ah....",
        "...feel like getting a cup of coffee?",
        "Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.",
        "Yeah! Oh my God! (to Chandler) Is this what it’s like to be you?",
        "Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we’re on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it’s like somebody’s ripping out my heart!",
        "Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?",
        "Hey, Kate!",
        "Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week...",
        "(to himself) And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah...",
        "Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani.",
        "(looks at her, shocked) What?!",
        "Get out of here, really?!",
        "Yeah?",
        "They gave me the shaft all right.",
        "Well Ahh, (he sees Kate and the director kissing) yeah! Yeah, sure, a drink sounds great.",
        "All right.",
        "Come on baby, don’t go. Please? What do you say?",
        "(to Kate) That guy’s like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?",
        "Hey, I’m not interested in her sweater! It’s what’s underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I’m going out with?",
        "Do you want me to want you to care?",
        "What?",
        "Come on baby, don’t go. Please? What do you say?",
        "Hey, it’s gonna be all right.",
        "What?",
        "Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah, y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight.",
        "Okay. (he gives her a peck on the cheek)",
        "Okay.",
        "(to Kate) Ah, are you okay?",
        "I don’t know.",
        "How do you mean?",
        "Maybe he could slip her the tongue.",
        "Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.",
        "And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!",
        "Something like that?",
        "Yeah.",
        "(to Ross) Hey.",
        "(to Monica) Hey.",
        "Hey.",
        "No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.",
        "Oh, it was so amazing. After the (pause) love making...",
        "Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming ‘cause, ‘cause her eyes keep going like this. (He closes his eyes and moves them around, kinda like he’s been processed by the devil, or something.)",
        "Hey.",
        "So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall?",
        "Y'know, about what happened with us.",
        "What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can’t tell me last night didn’t mean something to you. I-I was there, you’re not that good an actress.",
        "Nooo.",
        "Hi, Lauren.",
        "(on phone) Well, so anyway Beth, what I’m saying is I should’ve considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I’ve ah, I’ve recently learned what’s it like to be on your side of it, and I’m sorry. So, do you think you can forgive me? (listens) Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. (He sits down and crosses out something, and dials the phone again.) Hello, Jennifer? (listens) Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there? (listens) Oh, she’s not home huh? (listens) Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.",

        "Two it is. Ross, how about you?",
        "But you said one.",

        "Okay.",
        "Oh, hey, you guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!",
        "(to Chandler) And I ah, borrowed some of your cologne. I hope she likes it.",
        "The green bottle next to the shaving cream.",
        "So, so, what’d ya think?",
        "I-I wasn’t in that.",
        "(sees Kate) Oh-oh, hey-hey, Kate! Listen I want you to meet everybody. Everybody, this is Kate.",

        "Oh, hey, Lauren. Uh, you guys this is, this is Kate’s understudy, Lauren.",
        "Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.",
        "No, they-they weren’t in the play.",
        "Yes!!! Ha-ha-ha!",
        "Anyone mind if I save this?",
        "Hey! Are you okay?",
        "Listen, drama critics they’re nothing but, but people who couldn’t make it as actors. You know what you should do?",
        "Oh, classy.",
        "Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too.",
        "Uh, de-clawing cats. Hey, tell ya what. Let me walk you home. We’ll stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.",
        "Oh, you didn’t see the Post?",
        "No. Why?",
        "Oh, absolutely! You’re talented and you’re good looking.",
        "I know! That’s why they trashed me!",
        "Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute.",
        "I, I don’t get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again.",
        "Kate, do you even like me?",
        "Well so, how come you blew me off? Y'know? How come you were with him?",
        "Thanks.",
        "(Checks to see if she’s drooling on his shirt.) Okay. Okay, okay, hey. (Lays her down and covers her with a blanket.) There we go, let’s get your feet up there. (Looks at her) Good night, Kate. Sweet dreams. (Picks up a garbage can) I’m gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.",
        "(entering, happily) Hey!",
        "Yeah! I stayed at Kate’s, but ah, nothing happened. Hey, Pheebs, where were ya?",
        "Oh, it was great! Yeah, I-I walked her home, and it was amazing how much we connected, y'know? Then ah, then she passed out, but then she woke up. Yeah? And we stayed up all night talking, and now we’re like totally crazy about each other!",
        "What?",
        "You-you think?",
        "Two brothers, one died!",
        "Yeah?!",
        "Sorry! Sorry, I’m late; sorry, I’m late! My duck and my chick and a fight, it-it was ugly.",
        "(surprised it’s Lauren) (hugs her) (whispering) Where’s Kate?",
        "(stunned) What?!",
        "Oh, ahh, go to the window. I’m wanna run down to the truck and show you something.",
        "(grabs the window from the outside and sticks his head in) (whispering) When is she leaving?",
        "(making like he is yelling up to the second floor) I’m coming up!",
        "Hey!",
        "Wh-wh-what’s going on? Wh-what’s this about L.A.?",
        "But, but wh-what about us?",
        "Well, so, stay for the museums!",
        "Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? I mean, I’ll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.",
        "(to Lauren) In a minute!!",
        "Yeah, I guess it is. (sees Kate is watching, he turns Lauren so that he can talk directly to Kate, but still look like he is talking to Lauren) Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick ‘cause this is killing me. One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you’ve got things you have to do now, and so do I. And so… I’m gonna get on this spaceship, (smoke starts pouring in from the ceiling, and a ladder comes down, with flashing, colored lights on the side of it) and I’m gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you’ll be long gone. But I won’t have aged at all. (gets on the ladder) So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I’m gonna want to meet her.",
        "(leaving Central Perk and seeing Monica laying on top of Rachel\n      who is moaning in pain.) Oh my.",
        "Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.",
        "Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy’s\n      theory. Okay?",
        "Saw a girl with that vest.",
        "(on phone) Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks?\n      ‘Cause I was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those\n      guys are cute!",
        "(entering carrying a box) Hey!!",
        "I got you something! Open it! Open it!",
        "It’s cute, huh?",
        "Oh, well no problem there. (He picks up the chick, hugs it really\n      tight, and talks to it like it’s a little baby.)",
        "Hey.",
        "How’s she doing?",
        "Well yeah, don’t-don’t you think it’s a she?",
        "Well, anyway, I got to go change, I’m ah, meeting some of the\n      cast for drinks.",
        "What?",
        "Hey! Who was up from 2 o’clock this morning until 5 o’clock this\n      morning trying to get her back to sleep?",
        "Ohhh, here it comes.",
        "Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!",
        "That’s not what I said. Okay, I just meant...",
        "I don’t know, maybe we weren’t ready to have a chick.",
        "Do you think we’ll get our three bucks back?",
        "Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks\n      great in the blue one.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "(sees he’s watching Baywatch) Ohhh. (sees he still has the chick)\n      Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back\n      to the store today.",
        "Okay, good, good, good, ‘cause, good, ‘cause I was kinda having\n      second thoughts too. ",
        "That’s horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.",
        "What ‘cha doing?",
        "What about the chick?",
        "Are you sure?",
        "Sure.",
        "(stopping him) Wait. Give him a minute.",
        "Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck.",
        "Hey.",
        "(with a disgusted look) What was it?",
        "Whoa!!!",
        "No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.",
        "Yeah, right.",
        "So Pheebs, do they know about each other?",
        "Hey.",
        "(going over to him) Well?!",
        "Well what is it?!",
        "Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, \"Awww, he's got a Ross.\"",
        "Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.",
        "Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.",
        "Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.",
        "Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?",
        "Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.",
        "Oh sure, go with the sissy.",
        "Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.",
        "Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV.",
        "Look at this! A millionaire's checkbook.",
        "Hi, how ya doing?",
        "(looking at the checkbook) Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. (Monica is stunned) Oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is?",
        "Yeah, yeah. He’s got a, he’s got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can’t do anything about it. Is there something you can do?",
        "(lying on a beach towel, recapping what happened in the last episode) Okay, so we went to the beach, because Phoebe found out about this lady who knew her mom and dad, and I don’t really know what happened with that.",
        "(voice-over) Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldn’t go out with a guy like Chandler...",
        "(voice-over) ...and he couldn’t let it go, and... I don’t really know what happened with that either. ",
        "(voice-over) Oh-oh! And then Ross’s new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up and Rachel convinced her to save her head. And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I don’t know what happened there either... ",
        "Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler. (gets up and leaves.)",
        "Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don’t you wanna stay here and talk about it?",
        "(jumping up in a hole that he is digging, he is shoulder deep) Hey, you guys! Take a look at this! (Chandler and Monica jump up and go over to the hole.) Check this baby out, dug me a hole!",
        "Oh no! No!! My hole!!",
        "(climbing out of the hole) What?! What?!! What is it?!",
        "Yeah, and I’m a little tired from digging the hole.",
        "Well, there’s really only one thing you can do.",
        "You’re gonna have to pee on it.",
        "Don’t blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.",
        "If you want some privacy you can use my hole.",
        "Me too.",
        "No?",
        "Sure, it’s hard to forget! But that doesn’t mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, (to Chandler) ever talk about.",
        "It’s between us and the sea, Ross!",
        "Nope.",
        "NO!!!",
        "All right. (gets up) ",
        "Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It’s eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.",
        "And I was tired from digging the huge hole!",
        "I’d seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...",
        "That’s right I stepped up! She’s my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I’d pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn’t. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.",
        "(laughs) That’s ‘cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.",
        "How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide.",
        "Look, we’re not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!",
        "All right. But, you’re gonna have to tell them. (He opens the cabinet to reveal the chick and the duck living inside with Christmas lights and a disco ball as decorations.)",
        "Looks good, uh?",
        "Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!",
        "What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.",
        "Oh. What do you do?",
        "What? What’s wrong?",
        "(to Chandler) Dude, Phoebe’s mom has got a huge peni...",
        "Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don’t think any of them are gonna work out.",
        "Pretty nice?",
        "(to Peter) Good for you!!",
        "(looking at the flyer) Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!",
        "Uh, Pheebs, about your mom...",
        "(pause) How’s that going?",
        "That’s so sweet. (pause) I’m gonna get some coffee. (gets up and leaves)",
        "This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.",
        "Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn’t, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny ‘til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.",
        "Oh yeah? (opens up the center and takes out the stereo) If I can’t, I’ll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.",
        "Okay. (he gets in the unit and closes the door) See?! I told ya! ",
        "Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!",
        "(still trapped in the entertainment center) WHAT?!! ",
        "Yeah...",
        "(getting out) Awww, man! He promised he wouldn’t take the chairs!!",
        "Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn’t think big enough to fit a grown man!",
        "I was tryin’ to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I’m gonna do?",
        "(looking through a deck of cards) Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is!",
        "Dude, you don’t have to brag! We got nothing here!!",
        "Tell us!",
        "(to Billy) So you’re the gynaecologist?",
        "And it’s not fake, it’s totally brutal.",
        "What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.",
        "Yeah, maybe it’s like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns. (pats Ross on the butt)",
        "Yeah. What are we getting?",
        "Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. (thinking aloud) Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?",
        "(sticking his head out the window) Hey, the fight’s starting!",
        "(sticking his head out the window) Fight’s over!",
        "Check it out, he’s winning! (to Monica) Pete’s winning!",
        "No-o-o!!",
        "Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about\n      geography.",
        "Well, I think we all learned something.",
        "That you’re actually 50?",
        "Hey, Bonnie had s*x there!",
        "(walking up carrying a brown paper bag) Hey!",
        "No, it’s just my luggage.",
        "Hey!!",
        "Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!",
        "Hey-hey, check out the hat!",
        "(getting an idea) Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game\n      is?",
        "I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip\n      poker.",
        "Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, it’s like a\n      law!",
        "Hey, you know what naked card game is never boring?",
        "What?",
        "Okay, all right. ",
        "Fan out! Fan out!",
        "(jumping in triumph) OH YES!!!!!",
        "Yeah, well, I couldn’t find any cards, so it was either this or\n      Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff.",
        "All right, relax. It’s just a shoe.",
        "Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.",
        "Actually, y'know it’s kinda cold, so how about I keep my boxers\n      on, and give you all a peek at the good stuff?",
        "We’re playing Strip Happy Days Game!",
        "What’s the matter, Pheebs?",
        "What?!",
        "But I made cards!!",
        "(to Ross) Wanna play strip poker for practice?",
        "I’m telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!",
        "So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight,\n      you’re doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.",
        "Right, and you go with Rachel, Bonnie’s free tonight?",
        "Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?",
        "I’m gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.",
        "All right that’s it, school is in session! (Exits and slams the door.)",
        "Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you’re gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.",
        "Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.",
        "I have actually not heard of that.",
        "Why don’t you tell me something I don’t know! (He storms out, and once Treeger closes the door behind him, Joey makes an ‘Oops!’ have.)",
        "Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he’d better come up here and apologize. I’ll see you later. (Starts to leave)",
        "He said that he wasn’t gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he’s gonna do is have you evicted—I’ll see you later.",
        "Well he made Rachel cry!",
        "All right! I’ll try! But if I can’t, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.",
        "All right, all right, all right. (Starts to leave, stops, and turns around) I mean I’ll have to check with him first, but I’ll think he’ll be cool with it. (Monica shoos him out.)",
        "Please don’t kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn’t there fault, it was mine.",
        "No you can’t do that, where would the chick and the duck live?",
        "Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I’m the chick and Chandler is the duck.",
        "Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I’ll do whatever you want.",
        "Yeah-yeah, absolutely.",
        "What, what is it?",
        "That’s not, prison lingo, is it?",
        "Yeah, there’s this superintendent’s dance, the Super Ball. I don’t know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he’s a crush on.",
        "Well, he’s too shy, he doesn’t thing he’s good enough to dance with girls yet.",
        "Aww, man, now we won’t be bank buddies!",
        "Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I’m doing something exciting and I don’t wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y’know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!",
        "No-no, thank you.",
        "All right, I’m here, let’s ahh, get this over with.",
        "Whoa-whoa, don’t we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like ahh, get really drunk?",
        "No, it’s okay, but if I’m Marge, my breasts are coming out my back.",
        "Come on man, you’re not a potato.",
        "Come on Treeger, don’t say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, let’s ahh, let’s try it again. Come on. (they start dancing again) Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y’know, I’m not really that comfortable dancing with a—(Treeger throws him) We-he!! Hey!",
        "Ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time. (He walks into the kitchen and does a little dance step on the way.)",
        "What?",
        "No I didn’t.",
        "No, I’m not! And it wasn’t a hop it was a pademarie.",
        "All right, well maybe I’m enjoying it a little bit. I mean I’m getting pretty good at it.",
        "Hey-hey, hold on, this isn’t some kind of like girly dance. All right, it’s like a sport, it’s manly!",
        "All right.",
        "I don’t know how to lead.",
        "What?!",
        "(To Mr. Treeger) So you ah, ready for our last practice?",
        "Look, you wanna use our place?",
        "We did it!!",
        "I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.",
        "Oh well, okay, good luck.",
        "Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?",
        "Okay.",
        "Go get ‘em Treeger.",
        "(intrigued) Really?",
        "No, I’m good.",
        "Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there. (Goes back into the hall)",
        "(Returning carrying a couple of rusted lawn chairs) Huh?!",
        "Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!",
        "Just pickle.",
        "Yeah-eh-eah! (Rachel glares at him) Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant.",
        "Uhhhh. (He’s not sure)",
        "No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.",
        "Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.",
        "He cut off his ear.",
        "I’m out.",
        "Wow! That’s pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear ‘cause he sucked. What else you got in there?",
        "In the woods. No wait-wait, that’s the joke answer.",
        "Spock’s birth control.",
        "Wow! There’s a lot I didn’t know about vomit. (The duck comes to the door of the bathroom, quacking.) (To the duck) In a minute. (The duck goes back into the bathroom.)",
        "Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I’m home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there’s a few things you don’t get from book learnin’.",
        "How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?",
        "You wanna see what I got? (He gets up to empty out his pockets) Okay? I’ve got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!",
        "And a 50. (The salesman stops suddenly) Huh, these must be Chandler’s pants.",
        "Oh, I-I think I’m gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out.",
        "Wh-what’s going on?",
        "No he doesn’t!",
        "Well, it’s good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.",
        "Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.",
        "Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.",
        "Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?",
        "Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.",
        "Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Hey guys. (to Chandler) Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?",
        "It's 4:30.",
        "Okay, I see what's going on here.",
        "Yeah! You don't like Kathy.",
        "Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?",
        "Good, and hey! My treat. (He turns to go into his bedroom then stops.) But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?",
        "Is she great or what?",
        "(to Kathy) I'll be right back. (to Chandler) What was that?",
        "Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.",
        "I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.",
        "Well then, do it better!",
        "Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.",
        "(opening the door wearing nothing but a sock, and holding a dart board over the `Little General.') Hey! (Chandler turns down the TV) Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?",
        "Great! All right, so I’ll call you later.",
        "That would be Casey. We’re going out tonight.",
        "No, things are fine with Kathy. I’m having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.",
        "Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself! (Laughs)",
        "Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?",
        "What is the big deal? It’s not like we’re exclusive.",
        "You got all that from the back of her head?",
        "Who’s Elaine?",
        "(on the other end at a pay phone) Hey, it’s me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.",
        "We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I’ll be there as soon as I can.",
        "‘Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to—(he stops talking suddenly)",
        "Yeah?",
        "Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more—(his time runs out for real)",
        "(on phone) Hey dude, it’s me.",
        "Listen uh, I’m really sorry, it looks like I’m gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn’t there!",
        "Yeah, it must’ve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.",
        "Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.",
        "Aww man! I can’t believe I locked myself out again! (He knocks on the door.)",
        "(rushing in) Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?",
        "Why?",
        "Well, you’re amazing.",
        "(very excited) A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That’s the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?",
        "Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.",
        "Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I’m gonna do that.",
        "No-no-no, I think I’m gonna see how things go with Kathy. She’s pretty cool.",
        "No-no, Kathy.",
        "No. No, Kathy.",
        "Y’know what I think? I think somebody’s got a little crush on Casey. How ‘bout I fix you two up? What do you think?",
        "Hey! Samboucha Margarita?",
        "Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.",
        "What’s up?",
        "You do?",
        "Well, you’re timing couldn’t be better. She’s not my girlfriend anymore.",
        "Yeah, she broke up with me.",
        "Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that’s why I let people watch.",
        "Well, I’ve been better. But, I’m all right. So you like her huh?",
        "No-no-no, no it’s uh, it’s okay.",
        "Yeah. You know why? ‘Cause you can to me first.",
        "But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you’re work cut out for you. ‘Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she’s into some other guy. So…",
        "Who?",
        "What?",
        "And what?! Did you sleep with her?!",
        "What?!! That’s even worse!!",
        "I don’t know! But it’s the same!",
        "Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!",
        "Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line, that you-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!",
        "Is that why you bought all this stuff?! (Chandler makes a face like \"Well, kinda.\") Well, y’know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there’s a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I’m not gonna eat! You know why?!",
        "Because it’s all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I’m not happy about you either. (The bread maker dings) Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you. (Joey walks into his bedroom and slams the door.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Why?",
        "You can pee here!",
        "We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?",
        "Oh, I know...",
        "(entering the apartment) Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.",
        "It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?",
        "Why not?",
        "Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... \"Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!\"",
        "She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.",
        "(whining and heading toward the door) Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...",
        "Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?",
        "Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.",
        "So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?",
        "All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.",
        "What kind of smell?",
        "All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?",
        "You wanna see her again, right?",
        "So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah!",
        "All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! (Ross hesitates, looks unsure) Oink!",
        "(entering) Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!",
        "Our place, the hall! I...",
        "(Unimpressed) A book? (Suddenly interested) Is it like a book that's also a safe?",
        "You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. (Joey leaves, comes back in.) Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?",
        "Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.",
        "Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!",
        "Hey!",
        "You know, uh... [Joey moves the pen case out onto the counter.] Chandler got you a gift, too.",
        "Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!",
        "Ah. Hm. (To Kathy) Wanna go to bed?",
        "Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. (Tries to strike a sexy pose up against the doorway to his room. Then goes inside).",
        "(opening bedroom door) Hey, that coupon expires, you know.",
        "(answering phone) Hello.",
        "(answering phone) Hello.",
        "(answering phone) Stop callin’!!",
        "All right!",
        "Hey!",
        "I’m sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.",
        "No! I’m putting that in my room.",
        "Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?",
        "Five years.",
        "Hey! Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time.",
        "No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don’t know why you’re pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there’s a spot open.",
        "Yeah!",
        "What?",
        "All right. But if you weren’t my best friend.",
        "(entering) Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?",
        "(Something in Italian.) (Storms out.)",
        "My folks.",
        "I don’t know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.",
        "Yeah, y’know at first I thought we could talk about this y’know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don’t think I…",
        "Look, it’s not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don’t want to live with some one who doesn’t know what it is to be a friend. So, I’ll see ya. (He starts to leave, but Chandler grabs his bag and stops him.)",
        "Yeah! You did! And that’s why I’m leaving.",
        "When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!",
        "Yeah! But if would’ve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn’t have worried about it so much! See you around!",
        "We’ve got a box. (Motions to a large wooden box next to him.)",
        "(coming out of the bathroom) What’s twisted?",
        "Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!",
        "He’s fine!",
        "Chandler?",
        "Hey!",
        "He’s doin’ some thinkin’!",
        "You kissed my girlfriend!",
        "That doesn’t sound like thinking to me!",
        "Y’know I don’t think you should be talking at all in there! I think you’ve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!",
        "All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn’t mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you’re just an idiot in a box!",
        "So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?",
        "That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? (There’s no response from Chandler.) Okay.",
        "I’ll get it. (It’s Kathy.)",
        "Hey.",
        "That’s okay. Chandler’s the one I’m mad at.",
        "In the box.",
        "(starting to cry) Open the box!! (Runs over to do so.)",
        "He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! (He opens the box) Get out of there!",
        "Yeah, we’re gonna be fine! Get out!",
        "Yeah, you did some real good thinkin’ in there.",
        "Now go! ‘Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you’re secret Santa! (Chandler runs out and closes the door.)",
        "All right, who got Chandler? ‘Cause I uh, need to trade.",
        "Uhh, that’s not them. I’m gonna go call the police.",
        "Done! I did it! Heh, who’s stupid now? (He smiles and has cookie remains all over his teeth.)",
        "Well, I know what I’m giving you for Christmas.",
        "Ohhh!",
        "Hey, Mon! I’m not doing anything, why don’t you fire me?",
        "Good enough to get fired.",
        "Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?",
        "Yes!",
        "What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.",
        "Sure! Where are the seats?",
        "Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?",
        "Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!",
        "Oh, what are you gonna do? You’re gonna fire me?",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "(checks his watch) Damn! (runs out to work)",
        "(entering from the dining room) Hey.",
        "Hey, what happened to your fancy chef’s jacket? (sees there’s a burn spot on it)",
        "You got it! Oh-oh! (He starts patting the burned spot, which just happens to be over her breast.)",
        "It’s still a tiny bit on fire there.",
        "Yeah. Listen uh, I’d prefer it if you didn’t call me Joey. Since I don’t know anyone here, I thought it’d be cool to try out a cool work nickname.",
        "(opening an envelope) There’s like-there’s like 300 bucks in this one!",
        "No ma’am.",
        "I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, \"Wow! It’s been a long time since I had… (tries to do the math in his head, but can’t) 327 + 238 dollars!\"",
        "And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don’t fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they’ll start listening to all the nice things I’ve been saying about you.",
        "Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.",
        "(interrupting) Hey! Chef Geller! Y’know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!",
        "You bet I do! I just ah, wasn’t listening then, that’s all.",
        "What are you gonna do? You’re gonna fire me?",
        "Well I guess I should’ve thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!",
        "Yep! Looks like it’s gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.",
        "(leaving) Lean-lean-lean!",
        "I think I know that girl.",
        "Oh yeah, I definitely know her.",
        "Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?",
        "Well, why do you call him Gandolf?",
        "No, I had s*x in high school.",
        "Will you calm down, he’s just a human guy.",
        "Really?!",
        "All right, I’ll see you guys.",
        "I have an audition, but I’ll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?",
        "Okay. (leaves as the phone rings)",
        "Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you’d be out partying with Gandel-worf.",
        "So you’ve been sittin’ around here all mornin’?",
        "So what if he didn’t come! We can still go out and party ourselves!",
        "Well, we could do that!",
        "We’ll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yeah!!",
        "Yeah! All right? Let’s go!",
        "All right, so we’ll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we’ll head back out.",
        "So, we’re having fun, right?",
        "We don’t need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we’ll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.",
        "Are you serious?!",
        "Thank God! I’m exhausted!",
        "Yeah, but uh, I don’t want to be up too late, so uh, I’ll have a decaf.",
        "I can’t hear a word you’re saying, my ears are ringing so bad.",
        "Yeah, I know.",
        "Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.",
        "We’re 29, we’re not women.",
        "Guggly worm.",
        "Glow-pop giggly jammer.",
        "(examining it) Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year. (Monica drops the sandwich)",
        "(going over and picking up the rod) That’s all right. Hey you guys, you know what’s going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, \"Joey, what are you doing with your life?\" stuff. I can say, \"Well, I’m doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?\"",
        "Look, there’s nothing I can do for him right now, he’s still in his sweat pants, that’s still Phase One. Y'know? I’ll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.",
        "Gettin’ drunk and going to a strip club.",
        "Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.",
        "Yeah.",
        "(entering) Hey-hey!",
        "Oh my God, you guys have no idea.",
        "Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how’s he doing?",
        "(goes over to Chandler) Hey buddy! How’s it going?",
        "(To the rest of the gang) Hey, see that? He just needed his pal to come home. All right, uh, I’ve got to go memorise my lines. (Starts to go his bedroom) Me and Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning! Yeah-yeah!",
        "(running from his bedroom) Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!",
        "Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don’t have time! They’re just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.",
        "(rushing in) Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I’m here! I’m here!",
        "Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!",
        "(trying to act like he’s not the one that stinks.) Whoa! Yeah, what the hell is that? What smells so bad?",
        "Y’know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?",
        "No-no, it’s uh, it’s Heston.",
        "Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.",
        "Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?",
        "Interesting.",
        "How ya doin’?",
        "I guess you wouldn’t believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?",
        "No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I’m an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I’m doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.",
        "Yeah-yeah, I’m one of the cops that won’t work with you ‘cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I’m really sorry, but I stink!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh no-no-no, you don’t understand…",
        "Oh yeah, yeah.",

        "Yeah, all right. (Ross enters.)",
        "Check it out! Check it out! Guess what job I got? [smoothes the blue blazer he's wearing and has a big grin on his face]",
        "Oh, tour guide at the Museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.",
        "No, not really. They give you all the information. It's like memorizing a script. [demonstrates] \"And on your left, you have Tyrannsoarus rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.\"",
        "Yeah, but I can pronounce \"Jurassic\".",
        "[disgustedly] You're really thinking of having s*x with your brother?",
        "Oh.",
        "Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.",
        "[gesturing to what I'm presuming is the Mastadon] Okay, now the Mastadon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.",
        "[looks nervous] Shhhh. This is a museum. No talking. [moves group along and gestures to a three legged foot] Okay, now right down here we have, uh... a large foot.",
        "Okay, moving right along. [moves group away] Come on.",
        "Oh, uh, would you mind sitting here? [gesturing across from him] I'm saving this seat for my friend Ross.",
        "Doctor? I didn't know he had a nickname.",
        "Well, uh, how come?",
        "That's crazy.",
        "I, I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables but Ross is one of my best friends. If I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it.",
        "Ross, Ross, over here man. [gestures beside him] I saved you a seat.",
        "It's no big deal you know. You do what you gotta do, right?",
        "[looks at him for a second and then gets up to throw his garbage away.] Whatever.",
        "Look, Ross, really, it's no big deal. You know, you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then, so be it. I understand. When I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right? So, you know, it's cool. I'll see you tomorrow. [leaves]",
        "[gets up, tray in hand, and walks to the middle table] I will sit with you Dr. Geller. [he puts his tray down on the table and Ross and Joey shake hands.]",
        "[stands up, whips coat off and throws it on the floor vehemently] I'm Joey. I'm an actor. I don't know squat about dinosaurs.",
        "You hang in there Ted!",
        "Ohh, Nothing.",
        "I know what it did! Nothing.",

        "So what are you doing bringing her here?! There’s people here!",
        "Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. (They all look around and then back at Joey.) I’m tellin’ ya!",
        "Hey! What’s up?",
        "(to Rachel) I bet I stopped listening before you did.",
        "Dude, you’re not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.",
        "Hey-hey, what’s going on?",
        "Thanks for telling me!",
        "Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.",
        "Nope. (To Ross) Man look at this! Ross, I can’t believe you said you’d play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!",
        "(pointing to the TV) Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That’s called a scrum, okay? It’s kinda like a huddle.",
        "Ross! (Laughs) They’re gonna kill you!",
        "All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It’s not like he’s…Chandler!",
        "Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy (Points), and that guy (Points). And that one—Dude! They’re all huge!",
        "Well, maybe that’s because you’re closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.",

        "She’s mad because I know today’s her laundry day and that means she’s wearing her old lady underpants.",
        "Yeah, what’s that about?",
        "Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?",
        "Six.",
        "All right, we’ll start with…apples.",
        "Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt.",
        "Okay, the last thing…",

        "Hey!",
        "(to Ross) That-that is a good trick.",
        "Chandler, look they’re actors. They’re there to do a job, just ‘cause they work together, doesn’t mean they’re gonna get together. I mean just ‘cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn’t mean it’s gonna happen with them.",
        "Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.",
        "Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?",
        "Well okay, so then you’re fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it’s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It’s when the heat goes away, that’s when you’re in trouble.",
        "Look, you guys have been to every play I’ve ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?",
        "Noooo!!",
        "Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?",
        "Yep! Grab a plate.",
        "No-no, stay right there. (Monica stops and Joey flips her a pancake, which flies over her head and lands in the living room.) Gettin’ closer.",

        "(to Phoebe) Hey, how you doin’?",
        "Well, you gotta give him something that he can’t say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you’re guaranteed he’ll say yes!",
        "Absolutely! And if it doesn’t, can I get the extra ticket?",
        "What the heck is that?",
        "No! Forget her, man! You don’t need her, you don’t need that!",
        "Dude, tell me she actually told you this.",
        "Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There’s a lot of theories that didn’t pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.",

        "Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.",
        "Hey that’s what all my relationships are like.",
        "Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.",
        "Yeah, what’ going on?",
        "Awwww!",
        "Surprise!!",
        "What-what-what is so funny?",
        "Now that’s a thinker.",
        "A little salami.",
        "Pastrami.",

        "There was a seen in Footloose...",
        "Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl…",
        "What? Were you like in the movie, or… Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.",
        "Welcome to America. (They both kiss.)",
        "If you didn’t want to play, why did you come to the party?",
        "Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!",
        "All right look, y’know how-y’know how when you’re dating someone and you don’t want to cheat on them, unless it’s with someone really hot?",
        "All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you’re going to do something wrong, (He grabs two steaks from the freezer) do it right!",
        "Feel better now?",
        "Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.",
        "Well, I eat a lot of meat right?",
        "Well, suppose until the baby’s born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-you’d just be eating my animals.",
        "Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There’s no meat in beer, right?",
        "Okay, time to take off the bra. (She glares at him.)",
        "(trying not to be obvious) Take the bra off.",
        "Oooh, what you got there?",
        "Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y’know what goes good with that?",
        "Hm-mm, corn beef.",
        "Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that’s much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?",
        "(He starts looking longingly at the sandwich.) Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?",

        "Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how ‘bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours? (throws his shoulder into the center to try and move it, but it doesn’t move.)",
        "Umm?",
        "I’ve got five bucks says you can’t.",
        "Oh, I think I have the cash.",
        "Yeah, you got me. (picks up a 2x4 and puts it through the handles so that the doors won’t open) I’m out five big ones! (puts the money in the crack between the door and frame) Here you go.",
        "(reading the comics) Eh..., I don’t, I don’t know.",
        "Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?",
        "(thinks about it) Yeah?",
        "Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.",
        "I was shrieking... like a Marine.",
        "(reading the paper) Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. (to Ross) Where exactly were around ten-ish?",
        "Look out kids, he’s coming! (Ross continues to leave with his head down in shame.)",
        "Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it’s the only chance to see New York.",
        "Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?",
        "How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?",
        "He’s right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.",
        "Because, I’m too afraid.",
        "Yeah, that’d be much worse than being 28, and still working here.",
        "(to Joey) Does this mean we’re gonna have to start paying for coffee? (Joey shrugs his shoulders.)",
        "I spelled out boobies.",
        "So, how many have you sold so far?",
        "Oh my God, how did you do that?",
        "Me! On my computer.",
        "Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.",
        "Something else I might have said?",
        "You-you-you don’t wanna give into the fear.",
        "Run, Joey! Run for your life! (runs out)",
        "Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.",
        "(to Rachel, who’s entering) Hey! How’d the interview go?",
        "Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.",
        "Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.",
        "It’s like ‘Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.’",
        "Sure, everybody loves a kidder.",
        "(to Ross) Should I tell her I ordered tea?",
        "I’m an alien. I’m an alien.",
        "No, no, no, I don’t, I don’t really wanna play.",
        "That’s not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don’t say that I don’t have goals!",
        "Yeah, all right, I’ll play.",
        "No, no, no, you say that proudly.",
        "And was the curse lifted?",
        "But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won’t let me cross the street.",
        "And then Tineals.",
        "Wow! Just like in the pros.",
        "The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice. (goes to kick the ball but kicks Ross’s foot instead.)",
        "Sorry. I’m sorry. Y'know what, we’re just gonna throw it.",
        "No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.",
        "(coming up under center, just like a real quarterback does, and puts his hands between Ross’s legs.) Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! (Ross stands up and looks at him) You wanna go shotgun?",
        "(from the shotgun) Hike!",
        "Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.",
        "No, no, no, no, no!",
        "(running up) Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna.. (sees Marhan) Hi, I’m Chandler.",
        "Mar-haaaan.",
        "Well, that went well.",
        "Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.",
        "Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.",
        "Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn’t I wouldn’t have a shot?",
        "Math!! You’re giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we’ll see who gets her.",
        "Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.",
        "Hey! Well, I’ve been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that’s mean!",
        "Before!!",
        "Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?",
        "Okay, good.",
        "(to Margha) Hi.",
        "No-no-no-no, the game’s not over, we’re just switching teams.",
        "No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?",
        "And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?",
        "Fine with me.",
        "Yes!!",
        "Well, you don’t you have Captain Hook explain it to her.",
        "You hear that! That is her chose, mister I’ll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!! (does the wave.)",
        "Wh-what?",
        "Y'know what, it doesn’t matter, ‘cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!",
        "We’re not gonna lose to girls.",
        "Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!",
        "Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you’re five feet short, so we win!",
        "Guys! Guys! Come on! It’s Thanksgiving, it’s not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, (to Joey) the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!",
        "Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.",
        "Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.",
        "All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?",
        "I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.",
        "Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?",
        "(to Phoebe) It must take you forever to find your keys.",
        "(to Ross) Hey, so can you make it on Friday?",
        "Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.",
        "Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.",
        "Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! (pause) Don't cry outloud.",
        "I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.",
        "I'll get you the Cliff Notes.",
        "The abridgment.",
        "....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!",
        "Oh no, no, no, no.",
        "All right, I have to get that, but no-no. (answering phone) Hello? (listens) (happily) Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. (listens) Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? (listens) So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?",
        "Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.",
        "To yourself. (finishing) Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good.",
        "Bye-bye.",
        "What, what, what?!",
        "You really think that is what he meant?",
        "Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.",
        "Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.",
        "All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'",
        "He paints quite a picture doesn't he?",
        "Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. (holds up a pen) See, she's fully dressed, right?",
        "And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and (clicks pen) whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked! (Rachel just stares at him.)",
        "Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.",
        "Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some p0rn?",
        "Man, I gotta get a kid. (looks at the pen and starts laughing)",
        "Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.",
        "You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!",
        "Well, it's official there are no good movies.",
        "Hey, man. What's up?",
        "Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.",
        "Is anybody else scared?",
        "Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!",
        "(entering with his ringing phone) Joe. Joe! Answer the\n          phone.",
        "Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to\n          have to see her tonight. (phone stops ringing) Oh, that's\n          great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.",
        "Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put\n          half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.",
        "Noo.",
        "No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And\n          this alarm started going off in my head: 'Run for your life!\n          Get out of the building!'",
        "I know, that, (looks at her fake chest, and loses his train\n          of thought, temporarily) that's why I don't want to go\n          tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.",
        "Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be\n          afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the\n          tunnel, to the other side! ",
        "Do we have any...(turns around and bumps Monica's fake chest)\n          Do we have any thoughts here?",
        "You think?",
        "Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a\n          gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.",
        "'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this. (hands her a present)",
        "Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is\n          to go into your brand new drawer. (gives her a drawer) See,\n          the drawer actually goes in my dresser.",
        "Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and\n          that's what girlfriends should, should get. ",
        "Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and\n          there's more. We should take a trip.",
        "Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna\n          meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!",
        "I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life\n          I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like\n          what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in\n          together.' and I'd be okay.",
        "It doesn't scare me!",
        "Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too\n          much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!!\n          (Janice leaves, Chandler then calls Janice to leave a message\n          on her machine) Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just\n          wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the\n          street. (runs out the door)",
        "So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship\n          is going to fast and we have to slow down.",
        "Then I got all needy and clingy.",
        "She said she'd call me.",
        "Oh God.",
        "This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.",
        "So, you don't think I'm terminal?",
        "Okay, okay. So, should I call her?",
        "So I'm not, not gonna lose her?",
        "I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'",
        "(in a British accent) Hello, Janice.",
        "(in accent) Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?",
        "(normal voice) No. Not anymore.",
        "Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some\n          things for a party. (grabs a bag off of the shelf)",
        "Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as\n          yours.",
        "Here in Chelsea.",
        "A woman's",
        "(shyly) Chelsea.",
        "Can I be that guy?",
        "....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at\n          her, and ran out of the store.",
        "I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good\n          ice cream now, right?",
        "(answering phone) Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a\n          second? Okay. (to Monica and Rachel) Okay, what do I do?",
        "Hello!",
        "What are you, stop naming dwarves! (on phone) Hello, Janice.\n          Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a\n          really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about\n          you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid\n          a couple of more times. I'm sorry. (listens) Really?!\n          (listens) Really?!",
        "(on phone) I love you too.",
        "I will have one. (Ross and him both take one.)",
        "Okay, I’m not gonna have one.",
        "All right I’ll have one. (he and Ross take another\n          brownie,)",
        "See that is the problem with invisible dentists.",
        "That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I\n          look down the hygienist’s blouse.",
        "Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think\n          these pearls are nice?",
        "Janice’s birthday is coming up, I want to get her\n          something speacial. Come in here with me.",
        "That’s a good idea, ‘Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba\n          birthday’. I would like to get her something serious.",
        "All right. Look, I’m gonna go in here, and you don’t buy\n          me anything ever. (starts to go into the store)",
        "Why not?!",
        "What is the thing?",
        "(shocked) What?",
        "Well she, she wouldn’t do that, she’s with, she’s with me.",
        "Yeah, well, you’re wrong! Okay, you’re wrong.",
        "Ah, I don’t know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna\n          tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would,\n          tell me.",
        "You tell me! Maybe, it’s because I was just fooling with\n          my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!",
        "All right!",
        "Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.",
        "No! In his office! How many kisses were there?",
        "Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!?\n          There should be no kissing!!",
        "(giving her a bag) Here.",
        "I’ll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished\n          with me? (Janice shakes her head no) Are you finished with\n          him? (Janice shakes her head no) Do you still love him?\n          (Janice shakes her head yes) Do you still love me? (Janice\n          shakes her head yes) All right look, (grabs the bag) I’m\n          gonna need an actual answer here okay, so which is it, him\n          or me? (his phone starts to ring)",
        "Yeah.",
        "What?",
        "All right.",
        "I talked to Janice.",
        "She doesn’t know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I\n          woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy.\n          Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of\n          condoms. And now I can’t even return them, because she\n          choked on the reciept!",
        "I don’t know, y'know. What, what, would you do?",
        "Come on, tell me.",
        "What? (turns around quickly still ready to throw the dart\n          and Joey quickly ducks and hides behind the chair) What are\n          you, what are you talking about?",
        "Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you\n          to let me get through it, because it’s, it’s, it’s not gonna\n          be easy.",
        "I think you should go back with Gary. I don’t wanna be\n          the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents\n          split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see\n          him I was always think y'know ‘You’re the reason, you are\n          the reason why their not together.’ and I hated that guy.\n          And it didn’t matter how nice he was, or how happy he made\n          my Dad.",
        "Yeah, well. It’s the right thing to do.",
        "Then don’t leave me!",
        "Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!",
        "No you don’t! No, no, no, I say you have to give your\n          divorce another chance.",
        "Ohhh. Don’t go.",
        "No. No! No! No!",
        "I don’t care! (turns around and to the people watching\n          them) I don’t care!!",
        "You can’t leave! I have your shoe!",
        "(singing) ‘I’ll hold you close in my arms. (Phoebe enters) I\n          can’t resist your charms. And love....’",
        "(high pitched) ‘No you know I don’t mind.’",
        "‘I know.’",
        "‘I’ve found.’",
        "(entering) Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?",
        "I just saw Janice.",
        "Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid’s pretzel at them.",
        "Yes, but you ended up having s*x with both of them that afternoon.",
        "Oh, y'know what, I’m gonna be okay, you don’t have to throw a party for me.",
        "Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.",
        "Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it’s supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.",
        "Hello-dillillio!!",
        "(to Monica) Take off your shirt!",
        "Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.",
        "(to Monica) Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?",
        "Hi Joey’s sisters!",
        "Oh, I’m taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.",
        "No-no-no-no, no, it’s a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can’t we savor the precious moments? (to one of Joey’s sisters) Those are some huge breasts you have.",
        "Well, my apartment isn’t there anymore, because I drank it.",
        "Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.",
        "Ow, no ‘woo-hooing,’ no ‘woo-hooing.’",
        "Ah, I fooled around with Joey’s sister. (Phoebe gasps) Well, that’s not the worst part.",
        "I can’t remember which sister.",
        "Okay! You don’t think I thought of that?",
        "(to Monica) You see you can’t tell which one is which either, dwha!!",
        "Veronica. Look, it’s got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.",
        "Look, when I’ve been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I’m sorry.",
        "Why can’t we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.",
        "It’s gotta be the first one.",
        "Yep, I’m in a tree.",
        "Well, that’s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I’ll be in Cuba.",
        "What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?",
        "(shocked) Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?",
        "I’m here to see Mary-Angela.",
        "Where’s Mary-Angela?",
        "This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?",
        "Well, it’s, it’s yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?",
        "So um, Mary-Angela, what’s your second favorite?",
        "Would you just please....give me the receipt ‘cause this is great. It’s top notch.",
        "So will I.",
        "Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn’t mean anything.",
        "Will you excuse me I have to um..... (walks to the hall)",
        "(startled) Hey!",
        "Look, I may have jumped the gun here. (she tries to kiss him, but he ducks it and moves away) Um, I just got out of a relationship and I’m not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.",
        "Ahhhh, you’re not Mary-Angela.",
        "This is so bad. If-if you’re not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?",
        "Oh, this is soo bad. (doesn’t see Mary-Angela)",
        "No Joey! No Joey! Don’t Joey! Joey!",
        "(pats him on the shoulder) You’re it! Now run and hide!",
        "I wasn’t sure which one Mary-Angela was. (all of Joey’s sisters gasp) Look, I’m sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.",
        "Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother’s not going to punch me. (to Joey) Are ya?",
        "Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you’re my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.",
        "Okay, absolutely!",
        "You’ve got it. (he starts to look at his sister’s, but he still doesn’t know which one is Mary-Angela.)",
        "What?! (Cookie punches him)",
        "Don’t worry.",
        "I like her.",
        "Well, that’s pretty much all I’m looking for from these people.",
        "(to Ross) All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I’d like know whether that’s several big fish or just one big fish.",
        "No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called ‘wait until the last moment before I burst and die.’",
        "Jeez, man did you fall..(sees it’s a beautiful woman coming out of the men’s room) Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?",
        "(to Gunther) Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I’m-I’m talking to ah, (tries to get her to say her name). (to her) This is the part where you say your name.",
        "Ginger. I’m talking to Ginger, so....",
        "Nope, nope, I’d just ah, I’d rather talk to you. (pause) Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom. (knocks on the door)",
        "Well, that’s the best kiss I’ve had with anyone I’ve ever met in a men’s room.",
        "(sees her foot is in a slush puddle) Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.",
        "Yeah, we’re gonna have to get you out of those shoes.",
        "No, really you’re gonna freeze.",
        "You’re not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.",
        "Great. It was great. She’s ah, she’s great, great looking, great personality, she’s greatness.",
        "Joey told you about the leg, huh?",
        "Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn’t have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don’t want to stop seeing her, but every so often it’s like ‘Hey, y'know what, where’s your leg?’ I mean I’m the smallest person in the world aren’t I? I’m the smallest person in the world.",
        "(to Monica) Actually he’s the smallest person in the world.",
        "It came up.",
        "No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?",
        "No. No. I don’t think so.",
        "That’s-that’s my nubbin.",
        "It’s kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.",
        "Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... (starts to kiss her again, but she gets up.) Ahh, what?",
        "You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?",
        "(entering, happily) Well hello!",
        "The doctor.",
        "Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.",
        "That was an obvious joke, and I didn’t think of it. Why didn’t I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!",
        "Oh my God! Oh my God!",
        "Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?",
        "He’s right. Nobody’s gonna benefit, and you’re just gonna hurt her.",
        "All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing’s right. And that’s what deathbeds are for.",
        "Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac’s sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe’s friends with Rachel. And that’s the trail, I did it!",
        "Off?!!",
        "Yeah, well I don’t think you can make that statement, unless you’ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.",
        "Oh, that’s mature.",
        "Nothing, nothing.",
        "Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....",
        "(to Joey) He has s*x, and we get hit in our heads.",
        "Uh-oh.",
        "She was not good. Not good.",
        "Uh-oh.",
        "Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.",
        "Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.",
        "(handing Monica the wax) Wax the door shut, we’re never leaving, ever.",
        "Oh great, food with hair on it.",
        "Because that would be crazy?",
        "Yeah, come on, it’s Ross and Rachel, they’ve got too.",
        "What?",
        "Are you actually saying these words?",
        "Let’s go.",
        "(to Joey) Is that your new walk?",
        "This is the New York Times.",
        "We are. He’s meeting us here.",
        "Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.",
        "Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn’t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.",
        "Y'know what maybe it’s gonna be okay, I mean it’s been a week.",
        "No.",
        "Yes, yes, it’s just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.",
        "Yeah, he’s really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.",
        "(jumps back and points at the cigarette) Oh my God!",
        "Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I’m, I’m smoking still.",
        "Look, I’m telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.",
        "Yeahhh. I’m tellin’ ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....",
        "Oh that’s great, with my luck, that’s gonna be him.",
        "Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism. (answers the door and it’s Rachel again.)",
        "Hey, shut up!! You’re not my real Mom!!",
        "Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.",
        "Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.",
        "(to Joey) Well he’s probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.",
        "What?",
        "Beam me up Jesus.",
        "Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.",
        "Oh, come on, there’s a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.",
        "Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.",
        "Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!",
        "(to Joey) My lighter’s in there! (points to the cab)",
        "Damn! (stands up) The tailpipe’s not hot enough to light this!",
        "Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.",
        "Ladies, ladies, let’s just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica’s bra.",
        "Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.",
        "Okay, now let’s decide who has the nicest ass.",
        "At least let me smoke it to the good part.",
        "I have the lung capacity of a two year old. (starts to light another cigarette.)",
        "Well it’s very unsettling.",
        "Oh no, now it’s not gonna make any sense!",
        "Oh, this is horrible, it’s just horrible.",
        "It’s horrible.",
        "Y'know what, I can handle it, handle’s my middle name. Actually it’s the ah, middle part of my first name.",
        "Guys, guys, guess who I am?! (starts dancing around in an effort to stop the fighting.)",
        "I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.",
        "Yeah, baby!",
        "Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?",
        "Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she’s celebrating that by going on a date with him.",
        "Oh, hey.",
        "(to Robert) So ah, isn’t a bit cold out for shorts?",
        "Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.",
        "(standing up) I’m up! I’m up, I’ve gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?",
        "Okay Ross, why don’t you come with me?",
        "Robert’s coming out.",
        "No. He.....he’s coming out of his shorts.",
        "The man is showing brain.",
        "(to Ross) Wellll?",
        "What do we do? What do we do?",
        "Like an eclipse.",
        "Your liking it, huh?",
        "No, actually Laurie’s a boy.",
        "Hey.",
        "You mean a three pointer?",
        "I’m sorry, I’m sorry, it just seems that Robert isn’t as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.",
        "Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!",
        "Hmmm, that’s very cool.",
        "I can’t believe she cracked your code!",
        "No, Beth doesn’t die, she doesn’t die. Does she Rachel?",
        "We can’t tell him, you can’t go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.",
        "Yeah, we got, um-hmm.",
        "Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.",
        "Okay.",
        "No-no, why don’t you hang on to that one.",
        "Okay, that’s like the least fun game ever.",
        "Oh. (takes the cassette and puts it on his arm like the stop smoking patch, and it falls off.) Nope, that patch is no good. (Joey and Monica both do their fake laughs.)",
        "Or what my Father called Thursday night.",
        "Y'know, I would’ve bet good money that he’d be the first one of us to get married.",
        "Always illegal Joe.",
        "If that doesn’t keep kids in school, what will?",
        "(entering, carrying a briefcase) Hi.",
        "Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?",
        "Y'know what, pretty good.",
        "Good! I haven’t smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.",
        "Thanks",
        "What check thing?",
        "(reading the check) Pete Becker. Pete… (quickly grabs a magazine and opens it up to show her a picture) (pointing to the picture) Is this him?",
        "Who’s he huggin’?",
        "This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!",
        "There you go!!",
        "(to the girls who are staring at him) What?",
        "(in a feminine way) Oh my God! (and he jumps all around)",
        "Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.",
        "Okay, then get the lobster!",
        "(entering) Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I’m going down to the Xerox place.",
        "Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.",
        "Yeah! You wanna come?",
        "Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!",
        "Uh-oh.",
        "(to Joey) Okay, that hurt us.",
        "Well ah, ........y'know.",
        "All right, rock on. (Does the ‘Hang 10’ sign, then hides his face in shame.)",
        "Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?",
        "What time is it now?",
        "Yeah all right, so we’ll hang out.",
        "Yes. Vividly.",
        "Yeah, I-I-I think so. (Pauses and thinks about it for a second) Yeah, I-I think so...",
        "Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?",
        "She was kidding.",
        "She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.",
        "Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there.... (holds his arm out and pretends to grab something with his hand.)",
        "Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.",
        "Well it you don’t know that, then I don’t want to do this with you.",
        "And that’s the only colour that comes in.",
        "So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.",
        "Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.",
        "Hey, this isn’t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!",
        "Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.",
        "Why? What happened to him?",
        "Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.",
        "Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?",
        "Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?",
        "Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.",
        "It’s possible. You are very loveable, I’d miss you if I broke up with you. (Ross glares at him) I was just trying to be supportive.",
        "(in a deep voice) If I broke up with you, I’d miss you.",
        "And you’re our age. You’re our age.",
        "That’s not a state Joe.",
        "You’re our age!",
        "I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn’t matter, I still wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It’s so annoying. Does it bug you?",
        "Is there any chance you didn’t see that?",
        "Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can’t just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You’re gonna get peep eye!",
        "You didn’t just break up.",
        "You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!",
        "Okay.",
        "And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.",
        "Stop what?!",
        "No!! You can’t!!",
        "I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! (Ross is now dragging Chandler and the foosball table to the door) You are surprisingly strong!",
        "Look man!",
        "Listen to me!! (Chandler turns him around and closes and holds the door shut with his feet.)",
        "She’s moving on! Okay, if it’s not this guy, it’s gonna be somebody else! And unless you’re thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It’s over.",
        "Okay.",
        "I know. (He rubs Ross’s head)",
        "I don’t think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. (He blows on his hand) Draw!! (He quickly pulls the lever to raise the foot rest, like a gunfighter in a Western.)",
        "(to Joey) I wasn’t doing anything. (Joey starts angrily throwing his stuff down.) Uh-oh, what did she do now?",
        "Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.",
        "I think somebody has a crush on somebody.",
        "I’m talking about you. You big, big freak.",
        "Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you’d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!",
        "‘Cause it’s-it’s not his last name.",
        "No, it’s not like, like Phil Spiderman. He’s a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there’s no Gold Man.",
        "So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?",
        "What about things that are already gold?",
        "Okay, let’s play my game now.",
        "Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!",
        "My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh, that’s-that’s okay, no problem. (He starts to look around her office.)",
        "Yes, I realise that.",
        "That’s the stuff! (quickly grabs it)",
        "Thanks, it’s ah, Gaelic, for ‘Thy turkey’s done.’ So ah, I’m gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.",
        "Hello.",
        "(holding a tissue) And is this in case the house sneezes?",
        "Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.",
        "Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin’ out the Chan-Chan man!",
        "Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I’ll do it.",
        "(entering) Hey, my Father’s house does that!",
        "Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there’s nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.",
        "Of course, I didn’t get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna’s such a big, dull dud!",
        "(entering with Rachel) I’m telling ya, Joanna’s got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, ‘This was fun. Let’s do it again sometime. I’ll give you a call.’",
        "That’s what you say at the end of a date.",
        "To her face? Look it’s the end of the date, I’m standing there, I know all she’s waiting for is for me to say ‘I’ll call her’ and it’s just y'know, comes out. I can’t help it, it’s a compulsion.",
        "Multiple, so many paper cuts.",
        "(sarcastic) Oh, well give me the phone then.",
        "Look, you can’t call somebody after this long just to say, ‘In case you didn’t notice, I don’t like you!’",
        "Nooo!! She’s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!",
        "All right! Fine! But it’s just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don’t want you setting me up with anybody ever again!",
        "That’s just a lot of big talk, y'know.",
        "It’s not a big deal. It’s, just it’s right here, (points to his eye) and it’s all the time.",
        "(He looks over at Rachel, who nods her head) Yes, this, this was pleasant.",
        "The food there was, was great.",
        "So take care.",
        "Well, this was great. I’ll give you a call. We should do it again sometime. (Rachel is disappointed)",
        "Noo!",
        "Look, I’m sorry. Okay? I’m weak, and pathetic, and sorry.",
        "Ahhhh—I’m not going to call you.",
        "I’m sorry. I’m-I’m-I’m sorry that I said I was going to when I’m not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn’t Rachel’s fault. It’s me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, (pause) mascara goop. And I’m really sorry, it’s just that this is not, this isn’t going to work out.",
        "Yeah, o-okay.",
        "Well this is great! I’ll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!",
        "Ye-e-es!!",
        "Who’s number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.",
        "Bye!",
        "Yeah, and I don’t have any cologne.",
        "Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.",
        "(entering, carrying the chick and duck) Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?",
        "Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.",
        "(seeing Joey) There he is!",
        "Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.",
        "I know.",
        "So that’s the girl you like.",
        "Wait a minute, wait a minute, you don’t like the guy Rachel’s dating? Well, that’s odd.",
        "Could I borrow it?",
        "Oh-ho-ho-ho.",
        "7:15. (Monica looks at him) Watch doesn’t work.",
        "Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like, (claps his hands) banging his hands together!",
        "Ross, don’t. Ross!",
        "Ohh, that’s a good one.",
        "Why don’t you use ours across the hall, ‘cause she…has…problems.",
        "Step away from the duck.",
        "And yet, she’s still not hanging up the phone.",
        "(sporting a goatee) Hey.",
        "Oh, so that’s why the priest threw holy water on me.\n          (there’s no reaction from Joey) Okay, listen, you have to\n          cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean\n          anything is better than sitting around here crying all day\n          about Kate.",
        "Hey.",
        "No way!",
        "Oh my God! Who’s gonna watch that?!",
        "Yeah. (they start to leave)",
        "Thanks. (He takes off the vest and throws it on the floor.)",
        "So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did\n          it take for the roller skating thing to happen.",
        "Okay, so I guess that’s about ah, two weeks before the\n          topless thing kicks in.",
        "Hey!",
        "Okay. (He opens it and it’s a baby chick) It’s a chicken.",
        "Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.",
        "Easy Lenny.",
        "Okay, but this is the last time. (singing) With a chick-chick\n          here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick,\n          everywhere a chick-chick-(Joey enters)-chickeeeen.",
        "Hey.",
        "She?",
        "I don’t know. (He picks the chick up and turns it over,\n          trying to determine the s*x of the chick, and blows on it.)\n          I can’t tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.",
        "Excuse me?",
        "I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so\n          somebody could be here with our chick!",
        "You don’t think I get up when you get up?",
        "Yes, here it comes! I’m stuck here all day, and then you\n          come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go\n          off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don’t think so\n          mister!",
        "And you don’t think taking care of our chick is work?",
        "I know what you meant!! (pause) You notice that ever since\n          we got this chick, we’ve been fighting a lot more than we\n          used too?",
        "I’ll take her back tomorrow.",
        "Hey!",
        "(rushing in) Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a\n          chick out of a VCR?!",
        "I know. See, yes. That’s Yasmine Bleeth, she’s a completely\n          different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very\n          different ways.",
        "Hey!",
        "I did! But the store wouldn’t take her back! So then I took\n          her to the shelter, and you know what I found out? ",
        "If they can’t find a home for her, they kill her! And I’m\n          not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!",
        "Okay. And it’s not just chicks y'know? It’s all kinds of\n          other animals!",
        "Thanks, I’m glad you see it that way.",
        "Ohhh-hoo, funny story!",
        "Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you\n          did!!",
        "That’s a bad duck!!! (to Ross) How’d the thing go tonight,\n          Ross?",
        "(to the duck) Okay, now when you come back I hope you\n          remember that, that chick is not a toy! (He goes back into\n          the apartment)",
        "(coming out of his apartment and seeing Ross) What did you\n          do?",
        "Having a swim.",
        "Chicks don’t swim.",
        "I don’t know. Should we try it?",
        "See, I told you they don’t swim. (He goes to take it out)",
        "Noo! (takes him out) Oh, it’s okay, it’s okay, baby, baby,\n          baby.",
        "Or... Dick.",
        "Was it like a sneeze only better?",
        "No!!",
        "Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! (sees it) Huh.",
        "No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a…",
        "Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.",
        "Hey!",
        "Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.",
        "You're right, I know.",
        "(joining them) Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?",
        "Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.",
        "Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.",
        "Well sensitive is important, pick him.",
        "(sitting down on the couch) I-kea! This is comfortable.",
        "So, what do you thing the good news is?",
        "Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He’s not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that’s like a third or fourth date kinda thing.",
        "Oh, so you’re going with the teacher, huh?",
        "(comforting the duck) Everything’s gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?",
        "(to Monica) (in a funny voice) Hi there. (Monica turns her head away in disgust)",
        "(jumping up) Oh, I’ll go out and get you some.",
        "Nope! Because I’m not your boyfriend. (to Phoebe, who’s entering) Hey Pheebs, how did it go?",
        "I found a dried up seashores.",
        "All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?",
        "I’ve got canned goods.",
        "Excellent hole, Joe.",
        "Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!",
        "We’ve got to do something!",
        "Y'know what, he’s right. There’s something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.",
        "Me too!!",
        "Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I’m gonna break up with you!",
        "Look, Ross, you have what you want, you’re back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you’re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.",
        "(jumping up) Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!",
        "I’ll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.",
        "(running over and joining Monica) They’ll never understand!",
        "(following Monica) We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn’t think we could make it. (He goes to put his hands on Monica’s shoulders but for some reason can quite complete the action and pulls back.)",
        "And then Joey remembered something.",
        "(wails loudly into his hands) Joey kept screaming at me, “Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!” Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.",
        "(entering with Joey) (to Monica) Coffee house?",
        "I KNEW IT!!!!",
        "We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.",
        "Okay. All right.",
        "Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!",
        "You don’t turn and slide, you throw it out! I’m tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!",
        "All right, how about we, how ‘bout we sell it.",
        "(nods his head) Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? (to Joey) They seem all right with it!",
        "Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.",
        "(reading the ad) Stunning entertainment center. Fine, (pause) fine Italian craftsmanship. (Joey is very proud of himself)",
        "You want it?",
        "Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?",
        "All right look, I’m changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.",
        "(looks at him) Nooo.",
        "I can’t believe you don’t know what I do for a living!",
        "(interrupting) Let it go!!",
        "Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.",
        "You’ll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.",
        "Y'know, I, I really don’t think we need a canoe.",
        "All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!",
        "Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he’s wrong.",
        "Oh-no, he’s right.",
        "I’m coming already!!",
        "OH MY GOD!!!",
        "Are you all right?!",
        "(lets him out) What happened?!!",
        "What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!",
        "So--You got in voluntarily?!",
        "BEND OVER?!!!",
        "Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!",
        "Oh, they said uh, “You don’t have insurance here, so stop calling us.”",
        "Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we’d really appreciate it. (Joey nods in agreement)",
        "Do you think that there’s a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as you’re driving into town there’s-there’s like a sign, and it says “You’re in Sample.” (He says it like urine sample.)",
        "Yeah, it’s two guys in a ring, and the rules are: “They’re are no rules.”",
        "Yes, but there’s two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.",
        "Oh it’s Bing, sir. I’m sorry , I was just ah...",
        "All right buddy, way to go! (smacks him on the butt)",
        "Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.",
        "Well, I didn’t do anything. I didn’t want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.",
        "Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between ‘em.",
        "(to Ross and Monica) What if Joey were president?",
        "(to his co-workers) What is with him?",
        "Well, that’s not true, he-he smacked you once.",
        "No sir.",
        "(joining them) Hey! Which one’s my turkey burger?",
        "Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it’s gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I’m conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.",
        "Excuse me, Doug? (no reaction) Hey there sports fan!!",
        "No, I ah, I didn’t do them.",
        "No, no I just ah, didn’t do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don’t deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.",
        "Doug!!",
        "I’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.",
        "No, no. It-it’s not about the swearing, it’s more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.",
        "Oh, and don’t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It’s just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it’s making all the other guys jealous.",
        "Okay. (he starts to leave)",
        "Ahhhhh! (walks out, imitating shooting himself in the head)",
        "Thank you, sir.",
        "No. No, not at all, that’s-that’s ridiculous.",
        "Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!",
        "Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!",
        "(to Bonnie) So ah, your first sexual experience was with a\n          woman?!",
        "Tell it again. (pause, we see Rachel is not amused.)\n          Seriously.",
        "(reading the back of the picture) Me and Frank and Phoebe,\n          Graduation 1965.",
        "You’re not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster\n          cook.",
        "Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I’ll be your\n          boyfriend.",
        "Why is that so funny?",
        "Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend\n          material?",
        "Okay, so we’ve established my name, and hit me. But\n          theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren’t friends, say\n          it’s a blind date. I show up at your door, and I’m like (in\n          a fake voice) \"Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey.\"",
        "Hey!",
        "What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat!\n          They did experiments on me! I can’t have children!!",
        "Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?",
        "Big bullies!!",
        "Hey!",
        "Bored and bored!",
        "Yes!",
        "Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.",
        "So, you still don’t think I’m boyfriend material?",
        "I saw you checking me out during the game last night.",
        "Yeah, well, lucky for you.",
        "I don’t know.",
        "Oh, yeah, I don’t know what they were doing, but at one\n          point sea turtles actually came up to the house.",
        "Where ya going?",
        "(to Joey) Noo!! I don’t care! I’m not, I’m not gonna playing\n          one-on-one strip poker with you for practice! ",
        "G’night.",
        "Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don’t need\n          that kind’ve hurt. Take it from a guy who’s never had a\n          long term relationship......",
        "Ahhhh! (Steps away from her.)",
        "Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.",
        "There is not one hair on that head.",
        "(in a fake voice) Hi there.",
        "Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you’re gonna wanna date\n          this next guy, I swear!",
        "Hi! I’m Dorf! You’re date for the evening. (Monica walks\n          away in disgust) Oh come on! Dorf on dating, that’s good\n          stuff!!",
        "Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn’t say ‘cool’ anymore.",
        "Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I’ve missed the last 1200 times.",
        "You don’t think I’ve tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.",
        "Oh Maria. You can’t say no to her, she’s like this lycra spandex covered gym…treat.",
        "No!",
        "Oh no, you’ll have to come.",
        "Why don’t you just give him to somebody else?",
        "Because that’s the only part of you he can see when he’s on the table!",
        "Yes. (In a stronger voice) Yes!",
        "No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!",
        "Okay. (They go inside) (To the guy at the desk) I wanna quit the gym.",
        "I wanna quit the gym.",
        "(He turns to Ross and Ross makes a ‘Be strong’ sound.) I wanna quit the gym.",
        "(horrified at the prospect of trying to quit alone and unsure about himself) I wanna quit the gym.",
        "Hey.",
        "No, I almost did, couldn’t leave Ross there without a spotter!",
        "We’re doomed. Okay, they’re gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?",
        "You’re a genius!",
        "Now, there’s two reasons.",
        "Thank you, Joey.",
        "Hi.",
        "No, we’d just like to close them.",
        "I wanna quit the bank!",
        "To pay for the gym.",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah… Bunny-rabbit.",
        "Oh no-no-no, I’m, I’m paddling away!",
        "Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!",
        "Could we be more white trash?",
        "Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.",
        "Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.",
        "(laughs) No. No!",
        "Well, not at first.",
        "Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.",
        "Oh, come on! It’s not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I’m pretty much just in there by myself.",
        "Okay, I promise, I’ll end it.",
        "I hope you know what I’m giving up for ya, because she’s not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.",
        "…it was like the Algonquin kids table. (They all laugh, but Joey only laughs not to be left out.)",
        "It just doesn’t…feel like we’re breaking up.",
        "Okay.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Okay. (Starts to button up his shirt)",
        "I’m getting dressed.",
        "When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.",
        "What is it?",
        "Ah-ha, you’re not the boss of me. (She kisses him) Yeah, you are! (She handcuffs him to the chair) Ooh, saucy.",
        "You are, you’re gonna leave me like this?",
        "Okay. But if you don’t come back soon, (She leaves and closes the door) there’s pretty much nothing I can do about it!",
        "Hi! (to Sophie) How are you?",
        "Hello, Joanna…(Realises he doesn’t know her last name)…’s office.",
        "How little?!",
        "Look, this isn’t funny! You get back here right now!",
        "Why not?!",
        "What?!",
        "(in a serious, businesslike tone) Rachel, could I see you for a moment?",
        "Okay, here’s the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.",
        "I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!",
        "It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.",
        "No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can’t get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I’m cold, and (Stops and looks up the skirt on a statue behind Joanna’s desk.)",
        "Never!",
        "Fine!",
        "I—never borrowed your Walkman.",
        "You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! (Rachel goes over and unlocks the handcuffs) Ahhh! (He starts rubbing his wrist)",
        "No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. (He runs over to where his pants are hanging) Hello sweet pants!",
        "About what?",
        "I’ll make something up! I’m good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!",
        "Oh-ho-ho, I don’t think so!",
        "Well, this is much better.",
        "Hey, look, you’re in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she’s gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.",
        "It still wouldn’t be clean. (Rachel makes an ‘Eww, disgusting!’ face) All I want is my freedom.",
        "Freedom!",
        "Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won’t you here me?! (Opens the door) Sophie, help me! Help me!! (Sophie stands up)",
        "I’m gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just… (He moves his arm which opens the drawer and hits in the back of the head, which proves his point.)",
        "No!",
        "With extra pulp?",
        "No!",
        "You don’t have it.",
        "How do Monica and Phoebe know?",
        "(intrigued) Go on.",
        "And Milton Berle has a…",
        "(hello) Hello.",
        "(to Rachel) I love you. (Kisses her on the forehead)",
        "(checks his watch) Two hours, that lasted!",
        "I think so.",
        "Could there be more Kims?",
        "Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.",
        "I could die.",
        "I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.",
        "Hey! (Phoebe sneezes)",
        "All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?",
        "(gets up) (softly) Wish me luck.",
        "Wish it! (To the woman, Kathy, he likes) Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?",
        "Uh Kathy, with K or a C?",
        "Oh-oh-hey!",
        "Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.",
        "Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey. (Joey kisses Kathy.)",
        "Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.",
        "(sees Kathy is up watching TV) Hi!",
        "Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.",
        "Oh my God! That's why I got up too!",
        "Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...",
        "So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.",
        "That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.",
        "Is it on?",
        "Hey! (Runs over and gets his wonder broom)",
        "Oh! It's on! It's on!",
        "There we go little fella.",
        "Well the duck can swim.",
        "Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.",
        "She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?",
        "No, I don't.",
        "Thank you, Ross.",
        "All right.",
        "All right.",
        "Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! (She doesn't hear him and keeps running, Chandler starts chasing her as the theme to The Mod Squad starts to play. First, a car almost hits him and then gets mustard splashed on him as he runs by a hot dog vendor.) Kathy! (He keeps running and gets tangled up in the leashes of five dogs, in desperation he throws his paper.) Fetch! Fetch it! (He frees himself and resumes the chase) Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! (He now trips and falls into a pile of garbage, he tries to get up and scream her name again but he has a piece of spinach in his mouth. He gets out of the garbage and starts crossing the street by running over the hoods of a couple of cabs.) Kathy! (He jumps in front of her and out of breath he says) Kathy.",
        "Oh, I just wanted to say, \"Hey!\"",
        "Okay. (He walks away disgusted with himself.)",
        "(entering) Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.",
        "I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. (he waits for a reaction, when he doesn't get one) No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!",
        "Really?!",
        "(laughs) Right in there!",
        "99...100! Ready or not, here I come! (He opens his eyes and sees that the chick and the duck are still sitting in front of him) All right, let's go over the concept one more time.",
        "Hey!",
        "Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.",
        "Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.",
        "You-you do?",
        "You got me.",
        "Yeah. Right.",
        "Okay.",
        "Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.",
        "Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.",
        "Uhh, no-no thanks.",
        "Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer. (Leaves)",
        "What?",
        "Hey, look, what do you want from me?",
        "I am pretending.",
        "Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? (Joey gives him a thumbs up) No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!",
        "Can I sleep on your couch?",
        "(entering in a bathrobe) I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!",
        "It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it’s bad enough that I’m in love with my roommates girlfriend—which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we’re in the room together there’s this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I’ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she’s smooth! Smooth! (leaves)",
        "(rushing up) Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?",
        "Goin’ out, huh? Wow! Wow! (Does a little celebration dance) So things didn’t work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.",
        "(shocked) What?",
        "Wait! You’re going out with Kathy!",
        "Well, I’m upset—for you. I mean, having s*x with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (He can’t believe he just sad that.)",
        "Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she’s-she’s smart, and funny, and gets you.",
        "All right look, I think it’s time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.",
        "All right! Bring it on, you…",
        "(interrupting) Oh my God! Play!",
        "Really, bitchin’!",
        "You mean like, music?",
        "Yeah, I know what you’re thinkin’! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.",
        "Come in!",
        "Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.",
        "No-no, he’s not back yet, but he’ll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?",
        "I like it in the stern. (Realizes what he just said.) …of the boat. (The phone rings, and he answers it.) (on phone) Hello.",
        "What happened?",
        "Why can’t you tell her?",
        "Joey! Joey!!",
        "I thought your time ran out.",
        "(to Kathy) Uhh, that was Joey. He’s running a little late, he says he’s sorry.",
        "So I guess it’s just uh, you and me then.",
        "Yeah, I think it is!",
        "Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut…",
        "…and then it got canceled.",
        "Really?! You do that?",
        "Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don’t make my tail too poofy.",
        "Well, thanks. I grow it myself. (Kathy is running her fingers through his hair, and Chandler catches himself enjoying it too much.) Y’know who also has great hair is Joey!",
        "What-what ‘cha doin’?",
        "‘Kay.",
        "(jumping up to answer the phone) Oh the phone! The phone’s making sounds! (On phone) Hello!",
        "Hey it’s Joey!",
        "What?",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh yeah man. (to Kathy) Joey. (Hands her the phone.)",
        "Yeah. Yes! Yeah.",
        "Oh.",
        "No-no-no-no, this is bad! It’s bad! This is bad!",
        "Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?",
        "Okay!",
        "Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here’s what we do, we-we forget it happened.",
        "Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we’re unhappy forever. Sound good?",
        "I have to; he’s my best friend, and you’re seeing him.",
        "(interrupting) Oh-no-no-no! Don’t! Don’t! See-see, you’re getting me confused, I’m starting to urn.",
        "I-I think we have too.",
        "Bye. (Kathy leaves and Chandler wonders over to and leans up against the door.) Are you still out there?",
        "Hang on buddy! (He goes over and unlocks the door and opens it to reveal a fully furnished apartment.)",
        "I sure did.",
        "Well, I just thought it’d make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.",
        "Oh no-no-no. This is amazing. (He goes over and presses a button on a remote control that opens the entertainment center doors revealing the TV.)",
        "Well, y’know I’m 29. I mean who needs a savings account.",
        "Oh, I don’t know.",
        "You mean with Casey.",
        "Or Casey.",
        "Could be Casey.",
        "Consider Casey.",
        "That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!",
        "I kissed Kathy.",
        "No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he’ll understand this?",
        "Oh, don’t say that! Don’t say that. That’s not true. Is it?",
        "Then why didn’t you tell me to do that?!!",
        "God!! (Sits down in disgust.) What am I gonna do?!",
        "Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!",
        "Yeah, I know.",
        "Hey!",
        "Is that a real thing?",
        "Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.",
        "It’s-it’s about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.",
        "Yeah.",
        "What?",
        "Oh uh, when?",
        "Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?",
        "Yes, but I-I uh, don’t have too.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.",
        "See uh, that’s-that’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.",
        "It’s me. I’m the other guy.",
        "Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and…",
        "No! No! No! I just kissed her.",
        "How is that worse?!",
        "Look, I’m sorry! But there’s nothing I can do, I think I’m in love with her!",
        "You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.",
        "Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!",
        "Probably because…",
        "Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.",
        "Where did you, when did you, how did you... (Joey hits the back of Chandler's head) How did you get a girl like that?",
        "Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.",
        "Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?",
        "Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.",
        "Well, I have a call in about that.",
        "Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.",
        "Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.",
        "Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.",
        "It doesn't say that. Does it?",
        "Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.",
        "It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. (Kathy goes into the bathroom.) Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?",
        "(confused) Sure...",
        "I don't know... um, Grease?",
        "Rent?",
        "Okay, so when do you want to go?",
        "Yes, it is, at Office Max.",
        "A pen.",
        "Huh-huh! You can't give her that.",
        "Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!",
        "All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?",
        "For three years?",
        "All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?",
        "Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?",
        "Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.",
        "Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called \"Invisible things for Kathy.\" (Motions to an imaginary pile of presents next to him.) Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?",
        "She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.",
        "Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?",
        "Where?",
        "I got something for her. (Joey picks up the package, shakes it next to his ear, can't hear anything, switches ears, shakes it again.) It's a book!",
        "No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?",
        "No, it came out to an even twenty.",
        "Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?",
        "Oh yeah? That's great!",
        "[nodding, with mixed feelings] Aahhuuhhh....",
        "Hey! Happy birthday.",
        "No he didn't. [Moving it back.]",
        "Happy birthday! I'm sorry.",
        "See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.",
        "Oh, yeah... yeah.",
        "[to Kathy] Goodnight.",
        "Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.",
        "Uh, the book?",
        "What do you mean?",
        "(tongue-tied) Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, \"Uhl, ell.\"",
        "Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.",
        "Goodnight. (Goes to his room.)",
        "(on phone) Hey, it’s me. I know you can’t stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I’d try and apologize over the phone. All I… (Joey hangs up the phone in disgust.)",
        "Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I’m… (Joey hangs up the phone again.)",
        "(entering) Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!",
        "They couldn’t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.",
        "Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, ‘cause I wanna trade for her.",
        "Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?",
        "Oh that’s not true! That’s not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it… (notices the look on Monica and Phoebe’s faces.) Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it… (Phoebe looks confused.) Her initials…",
        "Op, y'know what though, it’s kind’ve a girlie briefcase.",
        "Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!",
        "Thanks.",
        "Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.",
        "Well maybe you should put some ice on it.",
        "He’s really picky about his patients.",
        "(entering) All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! (Ross is pleased.) I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.",
        "Oh y’know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.",
        "I don’t know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.",
        "Oh no-no-no, you don’t want to do that, then you’re gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.",
        "Like?",
        "When was the last time you saw her wear it?",
        "Big dog?",
        "I walk into a room and he won’t even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.",
        "Hey Joe.",
        "Hey! I’m sorry! That—(sees that Joey is about to leave) where are you going?",
        "Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?",
        "What?!",
        "Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I’ll stop seeing her?",
        "Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!",
        "All right look, if you’re not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!",
        "What?",
        "All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. (Joey looks intrigued) What?",
        "(He is now in the box, in their living room.) Sounds like a really bad idea to me.",
        "The meaning of the box is three fold. One (holds a finger up through the air hole), it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two (holds up another finger), it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three (holds up a third finger), it hurts!",
        "Air hole! Air hole!! (Ross retracts his hand quickly.)",
        "How do ya do.",
        "What happened? What happened?!",
        "Gotcha! (laughs)",
        "Sorry!",
        "Okay, okay, you got it!",
        "You can’t tell, but I’m trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!",
        "You’re right, and I’m sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won’t say another word tonight.",
        "Absolutely!",
        "So?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Man, this is…",
        "Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?",
        "Were you so late because you were burring this woman?",
        "How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie? (laughs, at they all look at him) That joke would’ve killed in Albany.",
        "Hey, look at this! (Holding a newspaper) They’re lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.",
        "All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can’t believe I missed it.",
        "Really?! I didn’t think girls ever just wanted a fling.",
        "Y’know what? There’s some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?",
        "Well, I have a girlfriend, I’m-I’m happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.",
        "Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?",
        "Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who’s boss.",
        "(he glares at him for a while) Yes.",
        "I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? (Drew looks at him) Og-ee-op, I’m not asking for me, I’m… I mean… No, I’m-I’m not gay, I’m not asking you out. I’m not-I’m not-I’m not gay!",
        "See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.",
        "Oh, y’know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.",
        "(to Drew) Oh, by the way, that is her full name.",
        "Oh well, that’s uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!",
        "Well, I don’t really know what that is, but let’s!!",
        "(entering) Hello, children!",
        "(to Rachel) Have I got the 50 guys for you!",
        "Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They’re buying me drinks! They’re giving me stuff! (to Joey) Knicks tonight?",
        "Wherever! I’ve got like 20!",
        "Y’know what, I’m gonna uh, play the field just a little more.",
        "Guys are signing over their 401-K’s to me?",
        "(pause) Yes. (to Rachel) Okay, there’s this one guy, Patrick, I think you’re gonna like him, he’s really nice, he’s funny, he’s a swimmer.",
        "Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.",
        "See, I’m not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?",
        "Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.",
        "It’s a big company, I don’t—if you—I…",
        "Oh yeah! With who?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hey, man!",
        "Well, like father, like son.",
        "Really?! I-I thought you weren’t looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.",
        "Ummmmmmmm, no.",
        "Why not?! I’d be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get—oh I see.",
        "(interrupting) Oh, y’know, y’know what Pheebs?",
        "I’m not Jewish, so…",
        "Bad dream?",
        "Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe’s song about?",
        "Prague?",
        "I did! I absolutely did!",
        "I’m sure you’re right, but why?",
        "Oh, man. I’m sorry, I’m so-so sorry.",
        "I know! I know!",
        "Well, y’know, you’re-you’re gonna meet somebody! You’re a great catch! Y’know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn’t have to lie once. (He sits down on the arm of her chair)",
        "Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?",
        "Oh, it doesn’t matter. (Kisses her on the top of her head.) Hey, y’know what, I’ve got two tickets to tonight’s Rangers game, you wanna come with me?",
        "Well, actually it’s a hockey team, so it’s angry Canadians with no teeth.",
        "Have you ever been with a woman?",
        "So there is no good time to ask that question.",
        "Our eyes are closed and we’re about to cross the street. Very good.",
        "(entering) Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?",
        "No-no, I don’t think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!",
        "Kathy’s with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!",
        "I’m gonna call and get off work tomorrow!",
        "This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!",
        "Oh man! I am so excited—I may vomit!",
        "Look you don’t understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y’know you’re never know what’s gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!",
        "Oh yeah, it’s beautiful country up there.",
        "It’s not gonna be exactly like last time.",
        "Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!",
        "(answering it) Hello. (listens) (to Ross) It’s Gandolf!!! (on phone) So, are you in town? (listens) (disappointed) Oh, well, well maybe next time then. (Hangs up)",
        "He’s not gonna make it, he’s stuck in Chicago.",
        "Stupid, useless Canadian money!",
        "Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.",
        "Oh-no, y’know with Gandolf we’d be out all night!",
        "And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?",
        "All right!!",
        "Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?",
        "Well, those were seals, man.",
        "Yeah, all right.",
        "Actually, me too.",
        "Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?",
        "Y’know what? We’re not sad, we’re not sad, we’re just not 21 anymore. Y’know? I’m 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!",
        "You don’t have to stop having fun just because I’m here. Kathy didn’t cheat on all of you. (To Joey) Well, except you. (They hug and Chandler goes into the bathroom with the chick and duck following him.)",
        "(opening the bathroom door and kicking out the chick and duck) Would you give me one minute!! Please.",
        "Y’know, I can’t believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I’m never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!",
        "That’s right! Where are the guys? I’m ready to get drunk and see some strippers.",
        "They got a breakfast buffet.",
        "Ooh, let me talk to him!",
        "Well, can I just…",
        "She’s shhing me! It’s my phone and she’s shhing me!",
        "Ow!",
        "Maybe, she doesn’t hit him all the time.",
        "Okay, I’m going to go stand over there. (Points and moves into the living room.)",
        "So y’know, uh, when’s he getting back?",
        "Y’know, I knew something like this was going to happen. (He starts to take off his pants, revealing that he is still wearing his sweat pants.)",
        "Yes you can. You’re thinking about time, you can’t go back in time.",
        "(laughs) No you can’t.",
        "You don’t want to be guys, you’d be all hairy and wouldn’t live as long. (Starts to go to his bedroom)",
        "Okay. (Starts to cry)",
        "No thanks, Mom!",
        "Ahh, come on! Y’know what—y’know what, I think I’m just gonna go home and call Kathy.",
        "No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I’m gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, I’m gonna get so drunk, I’m gonna wanna call Janice",
        "Ohhh!!",
        "Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!",
        "All right, well I’m gonna put my sweats back on.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Stripping!",
        "Okay, look, I’m gonna have to ask you all to leave.",
        "Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn’t picture myself with any of them. (Sits back in disgust.)",
        "(jumping up) Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!",
        "I am totally picturing you with all those women!",
        "Well, I’m there too!",
        "Stop it! You’re killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!",
        "Where I don’t want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have s*x with strippers and my friends!!",
        "Come on, let me see that smile.",
        "Please?",
        "I know, I know, but you’re gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.",
        "All right ladies, here’s what we’re gonna do. (Points to a stripper.) You are gonna take off my clothes. (To another two strippers) You two, go get the oils. (To another stripper) And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, \"Chandler’s the king! Chandler’s the king!\"",
        "Oh, that’s fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.",
        "Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!",
        "What do you want from me, I’ve never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, I’m sorry you can’t stay, (Rachel is upset about leaving the orgy with the cigarette guy.) but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. (The cigarette guy starts rubbing Chandler’s back.) What are you doing? (The guy just nods) All right, listen, I’ve got to wake up!",
        "I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black. [stops]",
        "Blue blazer *back*. He, he wants it *back*.",
        "Well, you, you know what I meant.",
        "[Chandler glares at her and then changes the subject.] So what job did you get Joe?",
        "You're going to carry their child and get them a Sony Play Station?",
        "Oh, yeah, sure. It's not mine anyway. It came with the pants.",
        "Yes. Right where?",
        "Yeah, you've, you've got to love the talking.",
        "Oh, we haven't had s*x yet. Okay, but what's the big deal, you know? This is special, and I want our love to grow, before we move to the next level.",
        "No, he's right, I'm totally lying.",
        "Well, Kathy's last girlfriend was Joey.",
        "No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him.",
        "Yes and I was saying the actual words.",
        "We share a wall. So either he's great in bed or she just liked to agree with him a lot.",
        "Yeah?",
        "[gets up to leave] All right, all right, I'll sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys. [leaves]",
        "[enters] Hey. Why's Phoebe singing to Karl Malden?",
        "[dejectedly] Yes, yes, we had the s*x.",
        "It was fine, you know, but she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, uh, \"Oh, I see your point. I'm all right with it.\"",
        "Look, you have to help me, okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman. I know where everything goes. It's always...nice. But I need to know what makes it go from \"nice\" to \"My God, somebody's killing her in there!\"",
        "You don't have to draw an actual wo -- [looks at Monica's drawing] Woah, she' hot.",
        "[shocked] There are seven?",
        "[points to diagram] That's one?",
        "Oh, you know what, I was looking at it upside down.",
        "And that's bad?",
        "Well you might if it were anything like seven.",
        "You said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!",
        "That’s a mailman! That’s our mailman! (Waves to the mailman) (Sarcastic) Hi. How are ya?",

        "Isn’t this amazing?",
        "Okay. Bye.",
        "Bye.",
        "Bye.",
        "B-bye!",
        "Bye. (Finally closes the door on her.) (After it’s closed) I can’t stand the woman! (Phoebe is shocked, Joey is relieved.)",
        "Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality—Well, they’re all back! Y’know? And she’s picked up like nine new ones!",
        "Don’t worry about it. I’m taking care of it tonight. (Chandler opens the fridge and grabs something to drink.)",
        "(standing in the door of the fridge) Well, I don’t have to break up with her this time. We’re not involved! I’m going to do a pre-emptive strike! I’m going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen! (Closes the fridge.)",
        "Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.",
        "(laughs) Okay, we have to talk. I’m just getting out of a very serious relationship…",
        "Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.",
        "I hear ya. (Pause) But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!",
        "No! No! Not, Paris.",
        "Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? (Thinks) Yemen. That’s right, yes, I’m being transferred to Yemen!",
        "I don’t know exactly.",
        "But I do know that it’s some time tomorrow.",
        "Y’know uh, you didn’t really have to help me pack.",

        "Well, we’re really not that close. (Pause) Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.",
        "Okay. Then I guess it’s just, wait here then. (Hands her the sign that says, Wait Here.\") (To the ticket agent) Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.",
        "Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.",
        "What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?",
        "No. All right, y’know what, she’s (Points to Janice) gonna think that I’m handing you a credit card, but what I’m really gonna do is hand you a library card.",

        "No!",
        "Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!",
        "Well, I then guess I’m going to Yemen! I’m going to Yemen! (To this old woman also going to Yemen.) When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?",
        "You!",
        "Well the vet seems to think that’s she’s becoming a rooster. (The rooster crows.) We’re getting a second opinion.",

        "I can check that for ya.",
        "Well… we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.",
        "(to Rachel) And you… Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel’s bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.",
        "Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.",

        "Yes!",

        "Unfortunately that is correct.",

        "Say 200?",

        "Yeah, but I bet it works.",
        "Well believe it baby!",
        "I knew it!",
        "Cool, girl roommate.",
        "Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!",
        "What?! What-what is it?!",
        "I can’t believe we live here!",
        "Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have s*x with the star of the play!",
        "I know!!",
        "Wow! She looks great. Doesn’t she?",
        "Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!",
        "Yeah, it’s like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!",
        "I’m totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they’re gonna go to their cast parties and he’s gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it’ll be like, \"So where’s your boyfriend, what’s-his-name, Chester?\" And she’ll go, \"No-no-no, it’s Chandler.\" And he’ll go, \"Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!\"",
        "All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?",
        "Really?",
        "So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?",
        "Yeah, I know but…",
        "Okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I’m fairly certain are the same thing.",
        "I’m right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there’s no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!",
        "Come on, it was like cousins having s*x up there!",
        "Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you’re having s*x with him.",
        "Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!",
        "Y’know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you’re up there every night, you’re naked, touching, kissing.",
        "Well, you can understand, given how we started.",
        "Well, that is what happened, and I don’t even see you denying this!",
        "Yeah, well, don’t expect that to happen anytime soon!",
        "Steps! (He opens the door to his apartment to Ross and Joey looking at the new Playboy) Slut! (Ross and Joey quickly hide the Playboy behind their backs. Chandler wonders into the girl’s apartment.) You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!",
        "I confronted her, and she didn’t deny it! (Pause) I don’t live here! (Goes back into his apartment and they all follow him.)",
        "Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie’s…",
        "Yes! See you and I have always been like—(motions that they think the same.)",
        "Did she call?",
        "All right, maybe I should call her.",
        "Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?",
        "Well y'know, what if she didn’t actually sleep with the guy?",
        "She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!",
        "That’s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.",
        "Oh my God!!",
        "Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I’m sorry. Y’know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.",
        "Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y’know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? ‘Cause we’ve had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y’know, I know for me—(Notices a pair of men’s pants on the chair.) Nick’s pants?",
        "Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!",
        "Well, she wasn’t sleeping with him.",
        "She is now.",
        "I’m saying that she… is a devil woman! Y’know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don’t hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.",
        "Because, I-I should’ve called! Y’know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would’ve gone out with Nick, and they would’ve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!",
        "Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.",
        "What are you writing?",
        "Oh yeah? (He grabs the pad and starts reading it.) Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you (Pause) never go out of style—what did you throw away?",
        "Hi guys!",
        "Without me?!",
        "Yes, but in Ross’s case, they both know in two weeks that’s it.",
        "Maybe that’s because soy-burgers suck!",
        "What are you talking about?",
        "Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there? (Points to the living room.)",
        "Like what?",

        "Does for me.",
        "Flashdance.",

        "Okay, I’m done with my choices, these are final. (holds up a little card)",
        "Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer.",
        "That would be me.",
        "Hey, it’s my list.",
        "Okay!! Okay!!",
        "Heavy thing, not getting lighter!",
        "(to Gunther) Thank you.",
        "Isabella Rosselini. (points to her)",
        "Damn! I can’t believe I took her off my list.",
        "Yeah, maybe.",
        "What you don’t think I’d go up to her?",
        "Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.",
        "Okay, hold my crawler.",
        "(to Isabella) Hi! Hi, I’m Ross, you don’t know me, but I’m a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? (Gunther hands her change) Or maybe reimburse you for that one?",
        "Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that’s okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, (gets his out) so I’m allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it’s flattery.",
        "Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don’t, don’t just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...",
        "Um, yeah.",
        "Um, no.",
        "But, okay.",
        "Um, see, but that’s not the final draft.",
        "Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler (Chandler waves) brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.",
        "What?",
        "(to the rest of the gang) We’re just gonna be friends.",
        "Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.",
        "Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.",
        "All right here. Watch me execute the three ‘P’s of championship play. Power. (swings the racquet) Precision. (swings the racquet.) and penache. (does a backswing and hits Sarah who’s started up the stairs, knocking her down, they both watch in horror.)",
        "I know. I feel horrible. Okay.",
        "Well, I’m gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she’ll like?",
        "All right, see you guys. (starts to leave)",
        "So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don’t have to sell those cookies anymore.",
        "Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?",
        "I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.",
        "Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. (starts to get out his wallet) How much are the boxes?",
        "(puts away his wallet) And what is second prize?",
        "Well, that makes sense.",
        "Yeah, Sarah, anything.",
        "Hi, I’m selling Brown Bird cookies.",
        "No, hi, I’m, I’m an honorary Brown Bird (does the Brown Bird salute.)",
        "Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I’m not invited to sleep-overs.",
        "No, please, please, um, it’s for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.",
        "Okay, okay! I’m going. I’m going. (goes across the hall to knock on another door.)",
        "All right!!",
        "...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.",
        "Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I’m trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I’m putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?",
        "No, but ah, there’s coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I’ll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.",
        "Mon?",
        "Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, y'know I’m sure that’s not gonna happen this time, why don’t I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph’s.",
        "Oh, come on, now you know you want ‘em.",
        "I’ll tell you what Mon, I’ll give you the first box for free.",
        "Come on! All the cool kids are eating ‘em! (chases after her.)",
        "....and 12, 22, 18, four... (Chandler starts laughing) What?",
        "Ah, we’re out. I sold them all.",
        "Monica, I’m cutting you off.",
        "Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.",
        "Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!",
        "Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as ‘Laser Floyd’ was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That’s when it occurred to me, the key to my success, ‘the munchies.’ So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me: 'Cookie Dude!'",
        "Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?",
        "Well you sure used a large font.",
        "Sweetie, calm down, it’s gonna be okay.",
        "What, that wasn’t the great news?",
        "(to the girl sitting next to him) Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell?",
        "Hey now! That was an accident, okay.",
        "What’s a scrud?",
        "I don’t have too. I can just look at you.",
        "(to himself) Not nice enough.",
        "(to himself) Good for a scrud.",
        "That’s crap!! Sister Brown Bird. (to Elizabeth) Good going. (does the salute)",
        "Hi there!",
        "Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency.",
        "Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.",
        "Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you’re gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. (she glares at him) That’s not how that was supposed to come out.",
        "That word was swans.",
        "No.",
        "I’m, I’m sorry you didn’t get to go to Spacecamp, and I’m hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah Tuttle’s Private Very Special Spacecamp!! (opens the door and Chandler and Joey jump up, their apartment is decorated like outer space, one of the leather chairs is covered in tinfoil.)",
        "Oh come on! Here we go! (picks her up and puts her in the chair) Stand by for mission countdown!",
        "Oh no! An asteroid! (throws the soccer ball off the back of Joey’s head.)",
        "Halftime.",
        "What?",
        "Um, Monica and I aren’t supposed to play football.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.",
        "Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn’t count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.",
        "Oh yeah! Then how come you didn’t get the Geller Cup?",
        "Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, ‘nobody won that game, ‘ and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... (pauses to collect himself, as he is on the verge of tears saying this) threw it in the lake.",
        "Anyway. That’s when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.",
        "Can I see you for a second?",
        "All right, we’re gonna play.",
        "Here you go. (throws her the ball)",
        "(holding both of their hands above their heads making rabbit ears with their fingers.) Bunny!",
        "Sweetie, don’t worry you’ll get picked. Chandler.",
        "Sweetie, now I pick you.",
        "Okay. All right. So let’s see, let’s play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we’ll kick off.",
        "Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!",
        "Come on, let’s go!",
        "Yeah, losers talk!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Okay, (to Chandler) this play, I want you to do a down and out to the right. Okay. Break!",
        "You, you go long.",
        "Until we start to look very small.",
        "Break!!",
        "One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!",
        "Uh, hello, it’s third down.",
        "Wow!",
        "It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.",
        "Okay, it’s second down. (turns away) Take all the second downs you need.",
        "Well, I said it loud.",
        "Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie..",
        "Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Okay. Hut! Hike!",
        "Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn’t count.",
        "Before the snap!",
        "Oh Pheebs, that’s great. It doesn’t count.",
        "Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.",
        "Oh-ho, okay.",
        "Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.",
        "Okay, first of all, I don’t play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!",
        "Oh really! Why is that?",
        "The Geller Cup.",
        "Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!",
        "That cup is mine!",
        "Chandler! Chandler!",
        "Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What’s with the tackling?",
        "Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough.",
        "Hey, where’d you get that?",
        "It’s no surprise that your winning, ‘cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.",
        "What?! The guys against the girls? See, that’s ridiculous Monica, because I’m only down by three touchdowns.",
        "Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you’re with me.",
        "Right. Okay, let’s play. Let’s go.",
        "Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let’s play some ball, guys.",
        "Okay, y'know what, let’s just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?",
        "Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...",
        "Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.",
        "Hey! It’s 42-21!",
        "Let go! Let go!",
        "No! You let go!",
        "How come it’s always us left in the field holding the ball?",
        "Hey! It’s starting to snow.",
        "Gimme the this!",
        "(to Chandler) It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!",
        "Why?",
        "Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.",
        "Hmm? Oh, yeah. (he makes a growling sound)",
        "Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?",
        "Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?",
        "What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?",
        "She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, (to Joey) he's really good looking. (Joey gives an enthusiastic thumbs up) What am I gonna do?",
        "Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities.",
        "Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em.",
        "(on phone) Hi, is Rachel there?",
        "This is Ross?",
        "Of Ross and Rachel.",
        "Oh hey, hey Mark.",
        "Okay.",
        "Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone?",
        "Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in his own office?",
        "Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she?",
        "What?",
        "Okay, bye-bye. (starts slamming the receiver down in anger.)",
        "Oh, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry sweetie, I was just trying to ah, I'm dialing another number. (hangs up)",
        "It's from Ross, it's a love bug.",
        "I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt!",
        "I mean my God...",
        "...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!!",
        "I would never do that!",
        "Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot.",
        "Why?! How?! How is he a genius?",
        "What am I going to do?",
        "I don't know you guys.",
        "All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!",
        "What's going on?! (throws the love bug at him) That's what's going on!!",
        "I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! What do I have to do to get some service?! (turns to Rachel) Hi Rach. (He's puts his hand on her shoulder and she knocks it away.)",
        "(entering) Hi.",
        "(sits down next to her) I'm sorry, I was an idiot.",
        "A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.",
        "Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.",
        "I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.",
        "Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.",
        "Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?",
        "Ahh, no.",
        "Are you jealous?",
        "You are totally jealous.",
        "Honey, I love you too.",
        "What?",
        "Huh.",
        "(to Chandler) Are you intrigued?",
        "There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi (Ben is\n      holding a Barbi doll) What's ah, what's my boy doing with a\n      Barbi?",
        "Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it,\n      again?",
        "You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so\n      am I.",
        "Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how\n      'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? (makes a\n      monster truck sound) No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder?\n      (squawks like a dinosaur)",
        "And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?",
        "You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very\n      important to you.",
        "(to Joey) Where there is no fear of commitment.",
        "Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben.\n      (singing) 'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi,\n      drop the Barbi.",
        "Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!",
        "Go Joe!!!",
        "(running into the hall, in slow motion) You'll never get me,\n      Joe!!! (he then pretends that he gets shot repeatedly and falls\n      back against Joey and Chandler's door, dead.)",
        "Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he\n      chose.",
        "Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't deal\n      with it, that's your 'too bad.'",
        "What?",
        "What are you talking about?",
        "Okay, you are totally making this up.",
        "(remembering) Oh God.",
        "There was no song. (to Monica) There was no song!",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay, that's, that's enough. (retreats to the bathroom)",
        "(coming out of the bathroom) Won't you dance around with me. ",
        "(singing) 'I am Bea. I drink tea. Won't you dance around\n            with....' (spills some tea and it drips onto his/her\n            dress) Ohhh! (runs away crying)",
        "Neither will I. (they both put back the brownies.)",
        "So what’s a matter, you need a dentist? I’ve got a good one.",
        "Why? Why can’t you go to him?",
        "Pheebs, come on, you didn’t kill anybody, these people just\n      happened to die when you went to the dentist. It’s, it’s, it’s\n      just ah, a coincidence.",
        "Thanks, Gunther. (takes the plate Gunther serves him and\n      Rachel comes up and kisses him) (to Rachel) Hey! (to Gunther)\n      Umm, can I get a napkin too?",
        "(patting his clothes like he is looking for his wallet) No, no he’s\n      not.",
        "What? (to Joey) So what are you going to do? I mean how,\n      how are you going to tell Chandler?",
        "Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few\n      hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.",
        "Well, they painted over the word ‘Sapien’ for one thing, then\n      they rearranged the figures, let’s just leave it at that.",
        "Yes, that’s what I was going to ask, thank you.",
        "You? You! Want to watch Ben? (in the background Monica\n      mouths ‘Don’t worry, I’ll be here the whole time.’ to Ross.) Yes!\n      That’d be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know\n      how empty her life is. (Monica sarcastically mouths ‘Yeah!’ and\n      holds up her thumb.)",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hmm?",
        "Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.",
        "(entering) Hey! Everyone.",
        "How’s my little boy?",
        "(noticing the outfit he is wearing) What’d you do, take him\n      whaling?",
        "Oh my God, he just said your name, that’s great! Good job\n      Ben.",
        "And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time\n      isn’t moving.",
        "Well, he’s finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?",
        "It’s okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the\n      time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you\n      did the best you could.",
        "I know! I’m saying you have to watch them all the time.",
        "Monica did it?",
        "Monica?",
        "Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?",
        "Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing\n      the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but\n      suddenly he’s leaving out ‘e’ and ‘f.’ It’s like they just ah,\n      I don’t know, fell out of his head.",
        "Oh, and also, he’s, he’s walkin’ kind of funny, his left leg is\n      moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he’s in there just\n      sort of y'know... (walks around in a circle) ",
        "Monica bang! Monica bang! (runs into one of the posts) Ow!",
        "Can we please focus here, a naked man’s life hangs in the\n      balance!",
        "He does not look happy.",
        "Real magic does exist.",
        "Ah, somebody’s at the door on the ceiling.",
        "Hey Chandler, there’s a party tomorrow, you’ll feel better then.",
        "Oh, somebody’s feeling better.",
        "Hi!",
        "Wow!",
        "What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?",
        "And he’s, he’s a total stranger?",
        "Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some s*x.",
        "Well, I’m just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.",
        "Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?",
        "Thank you. (to Rachel) So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Hi.",
        "Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.",
        "Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.",
        "That’s excellent.",
        "(to Rachel) So, he’s just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn’t want anything in exchange for helping him?",
        "Yeah.",
        "(to Rachel) You see what men do! Don’t tell me men are not nice! (points to Chandler) This is men!!",
        "Which one is Gina?",
        "That’s okay.",
        "Hey, Joey.",
        "Ah, which, which one?",
        "Mary-Angela.",
        "Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How’s it going. This is the hardest letter I’ve ever had to write. (to Chandler) What the hell’s a matter with you? How do you think Joey’s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?",
        "All right, look, look, you’ve got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.",
        "Where in Cuba?",
        "Bummer.",
        "No, I’m genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn’t work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.",
        "But, you, you don’t want to seem too pushy.",
        "(to Rachel, as she gets his number) What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home?",
        "That’s right good things, that-that is what I said. (glances at Monica)",
        "That is so made up!",
        "There you go.",
        "Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I’d expect nothing less.",
        "High collar and baggy pants say I’m a pro.",
        "You go get ‘em. (to Monica) What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way?",
        "‘Why don’t you call him?!’ Well, thank you very much! Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!",
        "Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.",
        "No.",
        "Well, yeah!",
        "(shyly) You grow up.",
        "Hi!",
        "Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I... (gives her a flower)",
        "Hi. (kisses her)",
        "How’d did it go?",
        "I’m so proud of you.",
        "Listen, I’m ah, I’m sorry I’ve been so crazy and jealous and, it’s just that I like you a lot, so...",
        "Yeah.",
        "Congratu!! (sees her hug Mark) -lations-lations.",
        "Maybe he’s just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?",
        "Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?",
        "Ah, we’ll all go. (motions to Chandler) Come on. (the guys leave)",
        "Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, she’s more..(shakes his shoulders, like he’s dancing) y'know, and you’re more (sees the look from Phoebe and stops)",
        "Hi.",
        "Hello.",
        "Yeah, huh.",
        "What?",
        "Come on sweetie! You’ve had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?",
        "(to Rachel) But work comes first! (to Mark) Oh hey, but that’s sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?",
        "Oh well that’s great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh? (picks a pad up off Rachel’s desk and tosses it into his box) Good bye.",
        "Okay.",
        "Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying ‘I’ll see you Saturday.’",
        "Oh, no, no, no, it’s-it’s not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....",
        "Oh, well...",
        "Well, I’m sorry, but ah, look if you’re not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?",
        "Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...",
        "Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?",
        "Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.",
        "Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.",
        "What should I wear, now I’m all nervous.",
        "(to Rachel) I’m really glad we came. (Rachel smiles and rubs his arm) You’re so pretty. I love you.",
        "(entering) So I nodded off a little.",
        "Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.",
        "First of all it’s Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn’t fly.",
        "Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.",
        "No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island. (Makes an unusual sound, then he realises that he still has his jacket on and quickly tries to shake it off, thinking it’s alive and attacking him.)",
        "No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don’t know, I feel like lately, I feel like you’re slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you’ve got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it’s dumb, but I hate that I’m not a part of it.",
        "That’s a little clearer.",
        "Sure, I-I-I... (hugs her and mouths No!!)",
        "Is everything okay?",
        "I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.",
        "Is this about Mark?",
        "Okay, it’s not, it’s not.",
        "Fine, you’re right. Let’s ah, let’s take a break, (goes to the door) let’s cool off, okay, let’s get some frozen yoghurt, or something.. (opens the door)",
        "(on the phone) I’ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don’t, don’t you think we can work on this?",
        "Who’s that?",
        "Is that Mark?",
        "Yeah! Got it! (slams down the phone)",
        "Yeah!!",
        "Na-huh.",
        "I love you.",
        "Okay. (Ross starts frantically looking for a clock.)",
        "Chloe, Chloe how’s it coming?!!",
        "Umm, oh, hey, I don’t know. How about a big one?",
        "Well then a small one!! Listen, let’s, we kinda have to get going!",
        "You, you sure you need shoes? (Chloe nods her head) Okay. (reaches down and picks up a shoe)",
        "Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? (He’s frantically throwing the cushions off of the couch looking for her other shoe) Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yes, yes I am, one of the many things I’m feeling. Well.... (picks up her coat)",
        "Oh, thank you. (She goes to kiss him, but he holds her coat up between their faces to stop her.) Hey, hey. (opens the door, sees Rachel, and hides Chloe behind the door) Rachel!!!!",
        "Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.",
        "Yes, you can, very much.",
        "(seeing the thumbs up) Ahhhh!! (Hugs Rachel tighter.)",
        "You think?! God, I, ah, I’m in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel’s all like, ‘I love you and, and let’s work on this.’ And all I can think about is, ‘What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?’ when I tell her what I did.",
        "What?! Look, we’re trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?",
        "Yeah, but don’t you think....",
        "Yeah, okay. (he plops down into one of the leather chairs, with the footrest extended.)",
        "What trail?",
        "Oh, I-I don’t think there’s any trail.",
        "(entering) Chloe? Hi..",
        "You took my watch?",
        "Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?",
        "Exactly. So you didn’t, didn’t mention anything to Issac right?",
        "You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven’t actually met...",
        "Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.",
        "Yeah, that’s the one. Listen, I don’t want to hurt her.",
        "Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?",
        "Actually, no, we’re not.",
        "No, we’re not.",
        "No, we’re not!!",
        "Right.",
        "Fine. I just need to know that you’re not gonna tell your sister.",
        "(entering out of breath) Jasmine?",
        "We met at Phoebe’s birthday party, I’m, I’m Ross Geller.",
        "Yes, I did.",
        "Very bad.",
        "I’m agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?",
        "Okay, Jasmine, please, please don’t. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?",
        "Thank you, thank you.",
        "(angrily) Who’s your roommate?",
        "Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn’t say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.",
        "(forcing the door open) Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!",
        "Rachel?",
        "No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?",
        "No!!",
        "No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.",
        "What?",
        "She was...",
        "She, she was different.",
        "Nobody likes change.",
        "What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.",
        "I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.",
        "Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!",
        "Look, I didn’t think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.",
        "That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.",
        "Look, I’m not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!",
        "Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn’t happen!",
        "Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.",
        "Don’t you realise none of this would’ve ever happened if I didn’t think at that same moment you weren’t having s*x with Mark?",
        "(pause) Yes I would.",
        "(less sure) Yes.",
        "(covering his ears and screaming) La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it’s, I mean it’s you.",
        "What? Come on Rach, tell me what you’re thinking?",
        "Order a pizza like, ‘I forgive you?’",
        "Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I’m kinda hungry myself.",
        "No anchovies.",
        "That’s okay, I’ll just pick ‘em off.",
        "You can have the last piece, if you want.",
        "What, now you’re not even taking to me? (moves over to the coffee table) Look Rachel, I-I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I’d lost you, I didn’t know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don’t cheat right, I, that’s not me, I’m not Joey!",
        "Y'know what, y'know what, I’m-I’m not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You’re the one that bailed on us. You’re the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!",
        "That’s what?!",
        "Okay, well here we are. Now we’re in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? (sits down next to her) Look, I, (on the verge of tears) I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I’m sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can’t. (We see Monica and Phoebe are almost in tears.) I just can’t see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.",
        "Okay, okay, okay.",
        "What?",
        "(moving over to stand in front of her) Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn’t work past it together...",
        "Look, look, there’s got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, (takes a hold of one of her arms.) I can’t imagine, I can’t imagine my life without you. (Both of them are starting to cry.) Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, (drops to his knees and hugs her around her waist) and, and....",
        "(crying) Yeah, but this can’t be it, I mean.",
        "Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It’s been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.",
        "Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? (in an Irish accent) Two days of darts, it’ll be great!",
        "No, no, no, this weekend guys!",
        "What’s going on?",
        "So, for the whole weekend?",
        "Yeah, that’s okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I’m alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.",
        "What a pity stay?",
        "Pity food? Y'know what that’s okay, all right, I don’t need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home?",
        "Where’s Ben?",
        "Ahh. (notices the table) Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?",
        "Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?",
        "Ah! (realises) Oh.",
        "Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. ‘Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.",
        "Yeah, well.",
        "Oh yeah, I’d love that.",
        "I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job. (he sits down at the table.)",
        "....right? Right? I mean it’s pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don’t, I don’t need them, huh, I’ve got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.",
        "(looking at the page) 717? (to Carol) Where’s 717? (He gets up to return the page, Carol starts to take the last of the food into the kitchen, but Ross grabs the last piece.) Hey, you’ve have more of these for Susan right?",
        "Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?",
        "Oh, now you want a favour?",
        "Well, oh, I’m sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I’m a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?",
        "No, I’m not gonna pick them up.",
        "No, Rachel doesn’t want me to....",
        "Yeah, you’re right.",
        "We were on a break!!! Okay!! (grabs the phone) We were, we were..., (calms down) yeah. Where are you? I’ll find you. (hangs up)",
        "Oh, you-you’re-you’re one to talk.",
        "He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I’m stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I’ve got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.",
        "Excuse me?",
        "(sarcastic) Oh please, can’t I come to your special, magical cabin?",
        "Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.",
        "All right Pheebs, your cab’s ready.",
        "You’re welcome.",
        "We were on a break!",
        "Hey-hey, it’s valid okay? And I’m not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me.",
        "That’s what you said last night.",
        "Okay.",
        "Obviously not to Joey.",
        "(to Rachel) Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.",
        "I can.",
        "Look, you guys, you guys should go. (Joey tries to say something, but Ross cuts him off.) No, I’m, you, you planned this all out, and I don’t want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.",
        "No, no, really, I’ve got to take the car back anyway, I’m spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It’s fine, no guilt I promise.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay.",
        "That would be great.",
        "I know!",
        "(entering) Hi! Sorry I’m late. Were you sleeping?",
        "Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could, ‘cause that’s not where you want to skimp.",
        "Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?",
        "Okay.",
        "So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?",
        "(outside the door) So I’m gonna take off then!",
        "What are you doing?",
        "No thanks. I’m 29.",
        "Oh sweetie, when do you think you’re going to get off tonight?",
        "Oh come on, not again.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.",
        "And what are you going to do for him?",
        "Okay.",
        "So, are you gonna see him again?",
        "Naked friends.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh.",
        "Yeah, make that three.",
        "Okay. (goes over to the counter) (to Chandler) What ah, what is the matter with you? What’s going on?",
        "What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay?",
        "What?!",
        "Are you sure? (Chandler nods: Yes!) Hold on. (walks over behind the couch) I’m sorry you guys, that was a coffee and a....",
        "Okay.",
        "No, no, that won’t be ah, that won’t be necessary (leans down and looks up Robert’s shorts, seeing Robert’s package.)",
        "Yeah, yeah, yeah!",
        "Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.",
        "Umm, Jo’s a girl, it’s short for Josephine.",
        "Hey! How’d the ah, basketball go?",
        "Calm down. There’s no reason to get testy.",
        "Good.",
        "Joey’s asking if you’ve just ruined the first book he’s ever loved that didn’t star Jack Nicholson?",
        "Oh.",
        "He’s right, even if it’s to say something complementary. (He stops and thinks about what he just said.)",
        "(to Chandler) Hey, don’t we have to...",
        "Pffhah.",
        "Nothing, it’s just that hypnosis is beyond crap.",
        "Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.",
        "Here you go.",
        "Sorry. (To remedy that, Ross scoops the cinnamon off of the top with his hand.)",
        "Exactly, it’ll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.",
        "And so now you guys are gonna be married?",
        "Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?",
        "Pheebs, if you don’t tell him, soon he’s gonna be married, and then you’re gonna hate yourself.",
        "All we’re saying is don’t rush into anything.",
        "Yeah, he-he’s right, he’s right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you’re young, you’re-you’re weird, chicks dig that.",
        "No the man’s right, that’s what I had with Rachel.",
        "No, I ah, I slept with someone else.",
        "It didn’t.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "Don’t ask me, I had it and I blew it!",
        "Oh, no! No!",
        "I’m the ring bearer.",
        "Hi!",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "What is ah, Rach in her room?",
        "Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn’t she know it’s our anniversary?",
        "What’s that on the bottom?",
        "Hey, honey.",
        "Hey, what’s going on?",
        "What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?",
        "(entering, carrying a basket) Hi!",
        "Well you said you couldn’t go out so.... (pulls the cover off of the basket)",
        "Yeah, but I got cous-cous!",
        "Okay, you don’t have to stop, I’m invisible, I’m not here. (lights a candle)",
        "Yeah!!",
        "(stopping grinding) Pepper?",
        "Okay sorry, whew.",
        "(putting out the fire with a squeeze bottle of water) Okay, that’s a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.",
        "I’m sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebody’s off the phone, how ‘bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.",
        "Come on Rach, you don’t have what, ten minutes?",
        "What? (to Sophie) Sophie, does she have ten minutes?",
        "Don’t yell at me okay, this is the most I’ve seen you all week.",
        "Yeah, but wait...",
        "Hey.",
        "No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.",
        "For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?",
        "Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.",
        "Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.",
        "No, but it’d be nice if you realised, it’s just a job!",
        "Yes.",
        "No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I’m happy for ya, but I’m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don’t know what to do anymore.",
        "Is this about Mark?",
        "Okay, it’s not, it’s not.",
        "Oh I’m, I’m making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.",
        "Okay, okay, fine, you’re right. Let’s ah, let’s take a break, (goes to the door) let’s cool off, okay, let’s get some frozen yogart, or something.. (opens the door)",
        "Oh, hi Chloe.",
        "Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we’re gonna break-up instead.",
        "What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.",
        "Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don’t I have to wait a while?",
        "Hi! It’s me.",
        "Really? I’ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don’t, don’t you think we can work on this?",
        "Who’s that?",
        "Is that Mark?",
        "Yeah! Got it! (slams the phone down, and walks back to the bar.)",
        "Ah, that’s okay, thanks.",
        "Look, I don’t feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?",
        "(to Chloe) I like this song.",
        "Oh, no, no.",
        "Hey, how’d the date go with Mr. Millionaire?",
        "Still?!",
        "I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.",
        "(entering) Hello.",
        "So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.",
        "Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.",
        "Then be supportive like a guy.",
        "Hi.",
        "You ah, wanted to see me?",
        "What?!",
        "What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes, I do.",
        "Yeah, I-I really do. (takes a dinosaur mug out of the box) Hey! This-this was a gift?!",
        "It’s still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!",
        "No!! Y'know-y'know don’t do me any favours. In fact, where, where’s the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, (picks up a book) Hey, this book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I’d like that back too. Yes, I do.",
        "I’m just trying to help you, move on.",
        "Petty...",
        "Petty...",
        "Petty...",
        "Small... (Rachel comes back into the living room and catches Ross mocking her.)",
        "Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!",
        "I’m-I’m gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!! (he kisses the shirt)",
        "Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...",
        "Oh-oh, okay, okay! (He quickly takes off his sweater in order to put on the T-shirt. It’s an old ‘Frankie says relax’ T-shirt, that barely fits him. Rachel nods her head in approval of the new look.) If you don’t mind I’m gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. (Starts to leave) You have a pleasant evening. (He exits and leaves the door open.)",
        "You bug me.",
        "I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she’d say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!",
        "Hey, it’s been like three weeks!",
        "Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I’m gonna kill myself, I swear. I can’t, I can’t watch this. (turns away, then quickly turns to look again) Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she’s going in.",
        "She’s going in. Wait! He’s going in! He’s going in!! The door’s closed! I, I can’t see anything but the door closed!!",
        "Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!",
        "I don’t know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I’ll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!",
        "Look, they must be stopped!",
        "I need juice! People need juice!!",
        "People need juice!",
        "Juice, I need...",
        "Yeah, okay.",
        "It’s just I miss her so much.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.",
        "We were all pretty shaken up about it.",
        "Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.",
        "You get the dollhouse.",
        "Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.",
        "Sure, what’s up?",
        "I-I know. Well if something comes up... (walks away)",
        "Uh, Pheebs, while we’re hovering around the subject. I just have to say dinosaurs, they-they don’t go, rrroof!",
        "Hey, what’s this?!",
        "This is the coolest house ever!!",
        "I would!",
        "Hi.",
        "Hi.",
        "It’s a little early to be drinkin’.",
        "Ohhhhh!",
        "Mon?",
        "Oh, fire! There, there’s a fire! Fire!!",
        "Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, we believe it originated here. (He uses a pointer and points to the point of origin.) In the Aroma Room.",
        "No Phoebe, don’t look! You don’t want to see what’s under there!!",
        "Uh, yeah, I ah, I also need two.",
        "Uh, no, it’s-it’s just this person.",
        "Yeah, kinda. It’s this woman from work. I hope that won’t be too weird. Will it, Rach?",
        "All right, I’ll see you tonight.",
        "Hey, hey Rach!",
        "Hi!",
        "Good.",
        "So it’s looks like we’re the first ones here.",
        "Yay!!",
        "Hey. Oh, I’m sorry, this is Cailin.",
        "And! Break!!",
        "Okay. (The girls leave.) (to Tommy) So uh, well, this-this is uh, this is awkward.",
        "Well y'know ‘cause Rachel and I used to go out.",
        "Oh! Well then this is awkward. So what do you uh…",
        "Oh! Yeah.",
        "Okay. (sees two people sitting in their seats.) Uh, huh. Excuse me, I’m sorry, I-I think you may be in our seats.",
        "(looking at ticket) Yep! Yeah, see this says D-13, and uh…",
        "No, I’m good. (He sits down, stunned.)",
        "(drags Chandler over to buffet table) I’m telling you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think he’s baaad news!",
        "Hi! Yeah! Tommy’s in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in front of him, I think he’s gonna snap. (He’s watching very intently)",
        "Go? Why?",
        "But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream.",
        "Uh, oh-ho bye.",
        "One.",
        "Look. Look, I wasn’t going to say anything to you, but... All right, I don’t think you should be seeing Tommy anymore.",
        "No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him.",
        "No, it’s not just ‘cause I’m jealous. (Both Monica and Chandler give him a ‘Come on’ look) I mean I’m not, I’m not, I’m not jealous, okay? It’s… Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.",
        "Okay, fine, fine. You don’t want to believe me? No, that’s fine. (starts to leave)",
        "You don’t want to believe me, I’m Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny… (turns around and almost spills his coffee on Tommy)",
        "Whoa, sorry Tommy.",
        "Umm…",
        "Okay, it’s coffee.",
        "It’s-it’s hot…",
        "(coming out of the kitchen with a cup of coffee, almost running into Tommy) Oh-ho, whoa! Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled this hot coffee on you.",
        "No, but it’s-it’s-it’s hot!",
        "I can’t believe no one believes me!",
        "You do Pheebs?",
        "Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "(triumphantly) I’m gonna be on TV!!",
        "Yeah! They’re putting together this panel to talk about these\n      fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel’s\n      gonna film it!",
        "Thanks. You ready to go?",
        "(entering, wearing a white suit with a little red bow tie) Hey,\n      you guys! Guess what?",
        "Y'know what I didn’t wear this suit for a year because you hated\n      it. Well, guess what? You’re not my girlfriend anymore so...",
        "Right.",
        "(to Monica) You like it right?",
        "Okay, good bye! (leaves)",
        "(entering carrying a garment bag) Hey!",
        "(sees the chick) Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV\n      thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you\n      think? (takes out two suits) This blue suit, or this brown one?",
        "Really? (Joey gives him a ‘Like I would know’ look)",
        "Wow! That aspirin dance really works!",
        "Oh my God, is that still...",
        "No you’re not.",
        "Rach!",
        "(stopping her from falling) Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go\n      to a doctor! Okay?",
        "And I’m sure you’re gonna make a big impression. Hi! I’m Rachel\n      Green. It’s nice to meet you. (He lifts his leg and imitates\n      shaking hands with it, just like how Rachel was trying to pick\n      up the aspirin with her feet.) Come on, you probably have a\n      broken rib!",
        "Rach...",
        "Rachel...",
        "Fine. I’ll go.",
        "(He checks his watch) Sure. I’ll help you.",
        "Ohh. (He drops the shoes, takes the brush from her, and licks\n      the tip. He doesn’t like how it tastes.)",
        "Okay. This stuff? ",
        "All right.",
        "Oke-dokey. (He pokes her in the eye with the brush.)",
        "Sorry.",
        "Sorry, I’m sorry. Close, close, close...",
        "I’m sweeping...",
        "Sweep, sweep....(He starts to paint it on her eye, making it\n      look like she has a black eye.)",
        "What? What?",
        "No. No, y'know you don’t, you don’t wear enough of this. (Rachel\n      is shocked) What?",
        "Well I, close your eyes, I just think you’re gonna like this a\n      little better, ‘cause, close-close... (He gets some more on the\n      brush)",
        "(blows it) Sorry. ‘Cause umm, I think this will make you a\n      little more sophisticated.",
        "There you go! Good enough for your party, huh?",
        "Yep?",
        "Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party.\n      Okay?",
        "(checks his watch) Sure, okay.",
        "What?",
        "Rachel, I’ve seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off\n      you naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your\n      belly button?",
        "Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.",
        "All I have to do is close my eyes. See? (closes his eyes) Woo-hoo!!",
        "Ah, I’m sorry.",
        "Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It’s one of my ah,\n      rights as the ex-boyfriend. (closes his eyes again) Oop, oh yeah!",
        "Okay, okay, I’m sorry, it will never happen... (closes eyes)\n      Uh-oh! Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you\n      and I’m the king. ",
        "Come on, would you grow up? It’s no big deal.",
        "Yowzah!!!",
        "Aww, come on.",
        "Oh my God!",
        "All right.",
        "Look...",
        "Okay.",
        "Rach?",
        "Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay, I’m gonna get your coat and then I’ll-I’ll put you in a\n      cab.",
        "(He thinks about it) Of course I am. I just have to make a call.",
        "Okay? (goes into the living room)",
        "(rushing back in) What?! I wh-, what’s wrong?",
        "Rach, you can’t look fat in an x-ray.",
        "(to Chandler) That’s a duck.",
        "Oh, it was, nah, well....",
        "Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on. (they\n      go into her apartment) Easy.",
        "I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery\n      Channel.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Eh, ‘cause I knew that if I told you, you’d make me go, and I\n      knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on. Come on.",
        "What?",
        "(breaking the silence) You should get some sleep.",
        "So, I’ll umm...",
        "No, that’s, no, as long as you’re okay. So I’ll ah, I’ll see you\n      tomorrow.",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something.",
        "No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.",
        "Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out. (starts to take off his pants)",
        "Come on you guys, it's no big deal! (He turns around and shows him his thing.)",
        "Well what is it? Is it a mole? (He moves closer to them, and they jump back.)",
        "Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?",
        "Ahhh.",
        "(entering) Hey guys!",
        "Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign.",
        "He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.",
        "At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name.",
        "(sarcastic) Yeah, that'd be cool!",
        "Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!",
        "Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.",
        "No?",
        "Well then, what is it?!",
        "Y'know I have dinner plans!!",
        "Yes, and the dimmer switch.",
        "Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom!",
        "Monica’s right. We’re talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can’t just rush into this.",
        "Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don’t want to make it savory.",
        "Gimme this. (Grabs the herbalist’s card and leaves.)",
        "Hi.",
        "Listen, I got to tell you I’ve-I’ve never been to a guru before, so...",
        "What’s a koondis?",
        "I guess it’s worth a try.",
        "What?! What?!",
        "We?! We angered it?!",
        "Oh God!",
        "Ow!!",
        "What was, what was that?",
        "What?! How’s that?",
        "Hey! (congratulates him)",
        "(surprised) Hi!",
        "Awww.",
        "Yeah. (closes the door, and goes over and kisses Rachel.)",
        "I know.",
        "(stopping suddenly and getting up) Okay, I gotta go.",
        "Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.",
        "Well, yeah. I can’t-I can’t stay here all night, and if I go in there she’s-she’s gonna wanna... do stuff.",
        "No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn’t work either, I can’t tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...",
        "Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?",
        "Yeah, yeah. (opens the door) It wasn’t every morning.",
        "Okay.",
        "It’s over.",
        "Well, it was loong. I didn’t even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o’clock shadow on her head. (They both start to laugh, then stop themselves quickly.) Anyway, she didn’t want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.",
        "Ohh! Thank you! I like mail. (He goes to kiss her again, but she turns away.)",
        "Okay. (He leans in to kiss her again, but she leans back preventing him from making contact.) Wow, it’s-it’s 5:30 in the morning. (Rachel laughs) So, I’d better get cracking on this baby.",
        "Okay, I’ll be up in, (looks at the letter) 18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.",
        "Oh. (looks at his watch) Oh-oh. (takes a drink of coffee and resumes reading the letter)",
        "Done!",
        "Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!",
        "I’m sorry.",
        "Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole ‘Does it?’ part just another glance.",
        "(interrupting) No, Rach, no. I don’t, I don’t, I don’t have to think about it, in fact, I’ve decided, I’ve decided that, that it.......does.",
        "Oh, sure! I’m sure.",
        "Hey!",
        "What happened?",
        "It does. It really and truly does.",
        "(finding the part) (looks up in disgust) It so does not!!!",
        "She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her! (Both Joey and Chandler shrug their shoulders as to say ”Well...”) (yelling) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!",
        "Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here, (reading from the letter) “If you accept full responsibility...” (to Chandler and Joey) Full responsibility! “...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do. (yells at Joey) Does it?!!”",
        "(calming down) Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you’re right. Yeah I guess I’ll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.",
        "What the hell happened on that beach?!",
        "(coming back in with Rachel) Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?",
        "What happened? Joey?",
        "Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... (stops suddenly and turns to look at Monica) Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!",
        "I missed you too.",
        "(getting miffed) I suppose.",
        "(getting angry) Umm-hmm.",
        "(yelling from the bedroom) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!",
        "And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!",
        "I didn’t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn’t finish the whole letter!",
        "I fell asleep!",
        "It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! (they go into the living room, trapping Monica, Chandler, and Joey in the kitchen) (to Rachel) Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means ‘you are,’ Y-O-U-R means ‘your!’",
        "(starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind it)",
        "Oh, no-no-no don’t you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!",
        "Who’s Chip?",
        "The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?",
        "Monica, you’re so lucky! He’s like the most popular guy in school!!",
        "(to Rachel) I was just leaving.",
        "Why? Did you write it?",
        "Well ah, actually...",
        "Well, umm, why don’t you give him a call?",
        "Oh, I’m sure.",
        "(whispering in her ear) Oh, that’s right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that’s gotta be embarrassing! ",
        "(reading the newspaper) Hey, here’s a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?",
        "I’m reading your ad.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Good, so do I",
        "Are you sure she’s in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma’s glycoma medicine again?",
        "So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?",
        "So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?",
        "So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe’s mom remind anyone of a cat?",
        "Come on, you-you can’t tell me you actually believe that-that there’s a woman inside that cat!",
        "No you don’t. ",
        "No you do--y'know what, you’re not gonna suck me into this.",
        "I do not always have to be--okay, okay. (starts to leave)",
        "(taking the flyer) Apparently Phoebe’s mother also goes by the name Julio.",
        "Yes, we have to tell her!",
        "(holds up a hand) Little girl misses her cat. (hold up the other hand) Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. (gets up) Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.",
        "Thank you.",
        "(entering) Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?",
        "(seeing Phoebe still with cat) You didn’t tell her?! (They all kinda shy away.) Okay, fine! Pheebs?",
        "Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place.",
        "No! No! Look--Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!",
        "None.",
        "I’m sorry.",
        "I don’t know what to say.",
        "(goes over to Julio) Come here, here, come here, come here, (pause) Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend’s mother.",
        "Oh! Y'know, I’ve got an extra futon.",
        "What happened?",
        "Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.",
        "Huh, what’s fish hooking... (Joey sticks his finger in Ross’s mouth and pulls on his cheek, y'know like when you hook a fish.) (to Joey, sarcastic) Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?",
        "(on phone) That’s right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. (listens) Thank you. (hangs up) (to the gang) Yeah, we have the reservations.",
        "(stunned) Dude, what are you doing?",
        "All right so, Chandler, from now on, don’t give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don’t turn your back to him.",
        "(walking up with this huge tub-o-popcorn and drink) Hey!",
        "Yeah, it’s the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!",
        "Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.",
        "All right! You go get him! Let’s go!",
        "Hey! How long until Pete’s fight?",
        "Hot dog?",
        "What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn’t expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn’t expecting to like anyone right now, but she’s really terrific.",
        "No, I-I’m saying I liked her.",
        "Pheebs, I think she’s great. Okay? We’re going out again.",
        "Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.",
        "Okay, we’ll be right in. (to Chandler) So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?",
        "Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn’t want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can’t.",
        "That’s too bad.",
        "Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?",
        "Yeah, I think she looks good.",
        "Go, go, go!",
        "Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.",
        "No-o-o! (Rachel gives him a \"Please?\" look.) No way! ",
        "Yeah well, if ah, if that’s the rule this weekend... (She gets\n      up) No!",
        "Get away!",
        "Stay away!",
        "(he gets up and starts to run away from her) No! (in his escape\n      attempt he crushes Chandler’s sand castle) No!",
        "Ow! Ow! Oh, no-no-no!",
        "Hey!",
        "Okay, (reading the card) Fonzy gives you two thumbs up, collect\n      two cool points. Yeah.",

(They all look at him, and he shuts up and rolls\n      the dice.) (he moves his piece) Okay. (reading a card) Take\n      Pinky Tuscadero up to Inspiration Point, collect three cool\n      points!! Yeah! Which gives me five, and let’s see who is gonna\n      lose their clothes. Ummmm, I think I pick our strip poker\n      sponsor Mr. Joey Tribianni.",
        "Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?",
        "Okay.",
        "Hey! (Rachel is shocked) Hi Bonnie!",
        "Oh.",
        "Good morning.",
        "(to Joey) Good morning. Nice breasts by the way.",
        "Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.",
        "Wh-haa-haa! Look what ‘cha did! (Rachel has her hand over her\n      mouth to keep from laughing.)",
        "Nooo, but it, but it’s great.",
        "Okay. (He gently touches it.) You can feel all the bones in\n      your skull.",
        "Hi.",
        "I was having a little chat with ah, Bonnie, and ah, guess what,\n      she-she happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um,\n      whole head shaving idea, and now, who was it? Oh, that’s right,\n      that’s right, it was you!",
        "She said you gave her the razor!",
        "Ahh, no, I’m good.",
        "Okay, have fun! Wooo!!",
        "You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head! What the hell\n      were you thinking?!!",
        "You don’t know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!",
        "Y'know, hey! You’re the one who ended it, remember?",
        "You still love me?",
        "You still love me.",
        "Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you\n      wanna, get back together?",
        "What?!",
        "What?",
        "That’s not true! Her, she doesn’t even know what she wants!\n      Rachel’s still mad about the whole thing.",
        "I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that\n      kiss!",
        "Good night.",
        "Okey-dokey!",
        "Hey, it’ll grow back, right? And she-she’s really fun, and she’s\n      cool, and-and I’m finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over\n      Rachel was so (makes an incoherent nasal sound), y'know? Y'know,\n      and I’m finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there,\n      and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her, and-and-and it\n      doesn’t work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through\n      that again?",
        "Yeah.",
        "(entering the bedroom) Hi. (closes the door)",
        "So why don’t you quit?",
        "Who is Maria?",
        "You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?",
        "So you’re strong enough to face her on your own?",
        "They make you take an oath?",
        "Then how do you explain the toe ring?!",
        "Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.",
        "One more time, \"Hey, don’t you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?\"",
        "Good! That’s good!",
        "Me? No.",
        "It’s okay man, be strong. (Chandler goes into the office.)",
        "No! And I’m not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.",
        "And that’s funny, why?",
        "Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.",
        "And that’s not against your oath?!",
        "Hello.",
        "We’d like to close our accounts.",
        "No-no.",
        "No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.",
        "Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don’t think Mom would’ve hired you if she didn’t think you were good at what you do.",
        "…I’m telling you it’s totally unconstituional.",
        "Hey!",
        "The volcano?",
        "With such a sad history.",
        "(picking up the slip of paper) Hello! What's this? Oh right its that girl's phone number. (Rachel ignores him) Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me. (He holds it so that Rachel can see it, she continues to ignore him) It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but...(Rachel still ignores him) Whoa! (Throws it in her lap) Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby! Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it. (He waves it in front of Rachel's face. Then suddenly Phoebe has to sneeze and Rachel quickly grabs the slip of paper and gives it to Phoebe for her to sneeze into.)",
        "Oh, mine's December...",
        "Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.",
        "(loudly) Good luck!",
        "Come on, Pheebs lay off him.",
        "Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "(loudly) So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!",
        "Oh.",
        "Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little \"playing\" ourselves.",
        "Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.",
        "Oh! (He bangs his fists together.)",
        "Monica knows.",
        "Well, I'm gonna go get ready, (Gives Monica the fist thing.) for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head.",
        "Hi!",
        "Wow! You-you look great!",
        "(she lets him in) Okay! (to her son) Hey Tommy.",
        "Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure.",
        "What?",
        "I-I-I...",
        "Who wants to make some long distance calls?",
        "Her date tipped me ten dollars. (Monica laughs)",
        "Pheebs, what are you doing?",
        "Are you serious?",
        "(entering) Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. (to Monica) So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?",
        "At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.",
        "You see Amanda and I have a very special...",
        "Fine.",
        "Here. (Hands her, her cough drops) (to Rachel) At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.",
        "Y'know if we ever go to war and you’re captured, you’re in for a big surprise.",
        "Oh, you could just go uh, \"greatest of ease… (plays air guitar) BAH-bah-bha-bhannn.\" Then go right into it.",
        "Well umm, y’know, I used to play.",
        "Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that’s-that’s when I really found my sound.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven’t played in so long, and-and, well it’s-it’s really personal stuff, y’know?",
        "No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in—No, yeah, okay. (Runs out.)",
        "Okay, guys.",
        "Here we go. (Plays one note) Y’know, I’ve-I’ve never played my stuff for anyone before, so it’s important that-that you understand it’s about communicating very private emotions. (Plays another note) Y’know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That’s what I’m…",
        "Really?! I mean, really?!!",
        "Wow! Thanks, you guys. That’s uh—ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I’ll be right back! Okay? (Runs to fetch them) This is so nice, I’m—I am so… (starts to break up and leaves)",
        "(His voice is altered to sound like a computer.) Electrifying. (He plays the sound of a ticking clock.) Emphatic time-time-time…",
        "(with the altered voice) Thank you guys-guys-guys…",
        "(to Phoebe) Hey!",
        "Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don’t want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?",
        "Pheebs…",
        "See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y’know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I… I won’t play anymore.",
        "Yeah, okay.",
        "Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.",
        "What?",
        "No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would’ve just stepped aside.",
        "Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.",
        "Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.",
        "Thank you, thanks. (Sits down next to the girls) Yeah, I lost it. Y’know, I’m not gonna play anymore, (to Phoebe) would you, can you finish my set?",
        "Yeah, like I could lose it.",
        "I played bad on purpose guys.",
        "Yeah—no, just that last song.",
        "You're welcome for a delicious dinner.",
        "I know!",
        "Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.",
        "I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.",
        "Fine by me; hope she wins.",
        "How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?",
        "So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?",
        "(moved by the kiss) Huh...",
        "Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?",
        "Mitzi is.....",
        "(mouths \"where?\") Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh (steps on some garbage and falters) ...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?",
        "Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh...",
        "Oh, yeah, why not?",
        "You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?",
        "Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! (Ross takes the loosely tied tie off and hands it to Joey who puts it on.) Here.",
        "What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.",
        "No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.",
        "I don't know. Soap?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, okay you're right.",
        "I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?",
        "It's, uh... it's endearing, really.",
        "(mustering up courage) Yes. Yes I do. (They go inside.)",
        "Department of Sanitation?",
        "Oh! (She kisses him) Ah. (They kiss more, and move down onto the couch. Ross's hand moves under some garbage) Aw! (His hand is covered with something brown and gooey.)",
        "(trying to make his disgust into lust) Ah, Cheryl!",
        "Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out.",
        "Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?",
        "Who gets whom. (They all look at him.) I don’t know why I do that.",
        "Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!",
        "So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I’m already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.",
        "Really?! Wow! That’s-that’s so nice, what are you gonna get me?",
        "Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.",
        "Oh, that’s not true! I’ve got her lots of stuff she never took back.",
        "Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.",
        "Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh…",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Everything? Even the TV?",
        "Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don’t you think you could at least hear the guy out?",
        "That’s a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?",
        "You’ve sentenced him?!",
        "Joey, the guy’s your best friend.",
        "Oh, who? Me?",
        "Wow! I’m honored! And y’know what I’m gonna do as my first act as your best friend?",
        "I’m gonna get you to talk to Chandler.",
        "He’s coming here for Thanksgiving!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard’s son, you’d be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.",
        "(to Rachel) Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?",
        "I just wanna check something.",
        "(He puts his hand over the hole on the box.) (to Chandler) Now, we’ll see.",
        "(grabbing the necklace) The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver.",
        "Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!",
        "What did you get?",
        "Hey.",
        "Like ‘em, like ‘em? Or, I’d like to get store credit for that amount like ‘em?",
        "Sure! Oh, and Joey’s got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.",
        "There’s nothing the matter with me. See, I’m not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.",
        "I don’t know what to say, I’m sorry. Though, you’re not supposed to take these. (Points to the bone) It’s like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.",
        "He’s taking her purse!",
        "Hey!",
        "I’m sorry I’m late, did I miss anything?",
        "15? (Joey nods again) Your personal best! (Ross takes an Oreo and Joey mumbles, no!)",
        "Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.",
        "Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she’d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.",
        "No, I’m getting back down ‘cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she’s like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.",
        "Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.",
        "You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?",
        "Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can’t decide between the two of them. Y’know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she’s a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y’know she’s, well she’s-she’s just as pretty, I guess she’s smart, she’s not fun.",
        "Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y’know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was—if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn’t kidding, she’s not fun, she’s stupid, and kind of a racist.",
        "Hey!",
        "I wasn’t sleeping.",
        "The one with the cat. I gotta go, I’ve got another date.",
        "No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought—it wasn’t that funny. So I’m still torn.",
        "Y’know, you’re right. Thank you.",
        "(waking up) What? (notices that there is now a beautiful woman sitting next to him)",
        "What?",
        "(now fully awake) Are we really in Montreal?!",
        "Coffee sounds great. (They get up) Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?",
        "What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!",
        "I don’t know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there’s this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.",
        "Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?",
        "Dude, we are sooo gonna party!",
        "Mike \"Gandolf\" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world.",
        "I’m gonna call after you!",
        "Woooo!!!",
        "Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!",
        "Gandolf the wizard. (Joey is still confused) Hello! Didn’t you read Lord of the Rings in high school?",
        "(entering) Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!",
        "Whoa-whoa-whoa!",
        "Somewhere maybe along the equator?",
        "What happened?",
        "Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!",
        "It’s Gandolf, and he’s not coming.",
        "No! I balanced my checkbook.",
        "I can’t believe he didn’t come!",
        "Yeah! We’d meet, we’d meet total strangers, and hang out with them!",
        "There’s other stuff too.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yeah!!",
        "It’s not like we don’t know how to party!!",
        "Yeah!!!",
        "(to Chandler) Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Okay.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I’m kinda beat.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, me too.",
        "I’m just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y’know? I used them as mittens, I didn’t want to touch a thing in that last place.",
        "How sad are we?",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yeah!",
        "And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!",
        "(pretend fishing in the living room) Ohh, Geller’s got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! (Swinging the rod back and forth) It’s the classic struggle between man and—(swings the rod and knocks over a lamp.) Someone knocked over a lamp.",
        "Because there are naked ladies there.",
        "There are naked ladies there too.",
        "Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take ‘em off and we’ll have some fun.",
        "Hi!",
        "Catch any big fish? (Phoebe, Ross, and Monica all go over to him.)",
        "Are you kidding?!",
        "He hasn’t gotten out of that chair in two days.",
        "Hey!",
        "Hi!",
        "No.",
        "You want me to take some girl I’ve never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.",
        "All right, I’ll do it.",
        "Please hurry.",
        "When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who wouldn’t be miserable? I’m telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.",
        "I’ve gotta go, there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard! (He hangs up and runs out.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Emily is…incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it, I mean the whole weekend was like a dream. (Sees Rachel coming back from the bathroom.) Oh! And you! Rach!",
        "Hey! You were so right!",
        "Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be happy for each other.",
        "I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn’t quite there. Y’know, I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy…",
        "Joshua…guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought of it kinda…y’know.",
        "But now! I’m there! I’m totally there! I’m-I’m finally where you are!",
        "Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily.",
        "Happy for you. (He punches her back.)",
        "What?",
        "Uh, actually Joey, it's the Cretaceous period.",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Pheebs, you're talking about putting your body through an awful lot. I mean, morning sickness, uh, labour. And it's all for somebody else.",
        "The stuff I just mentioned.",
        "Yeah, that is nice......lying!! No way is that the reason.",
        "And you're afraid you won't be able to *fill his shoes*. [grins]",
        "[stops grinning] Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.",
        "Just go for it Chandler.",
        "[waves back and takes something (a piece of chalk?) from his hand and pretends to make it disappear in his ear. He then makes it appear from his mouth.]",
        "[puts his tray on the table with the other scientists. He looks at the scientists and then at Joey.] That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later.",
        "[enters] Hey. (to Joey) Listen, I'm really really sorry about what happened today in the cafeteria.",
        "It's not just me. The scientists and the tour guides *never* sit together.",
        "It's like that everywhere Joey. Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work, the waiters eat with the other waiters and the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?",
        "Thank you Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table [puts tray down on middle table] in the middle. I'm having my lunch right here with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.",
        "You know, we work in the Museum of Natural History, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and you know what I see? I see division. Division between people with white coats and people in blue blazers. And I ask, myself, my God, WHY? Now I say, we shed these coats that separate us and get to know the people underneath. [He whips off his lab coat and throws it on the floor.] I'm Ross. I'm divorced, and I have a kid.",
        "All right, there you go.",
        "Okay, okay, good for you.",
        "[stammering] oh, uh, er, Wow, Rhonda.",
        "Ah, okay Scott!",
        "No, it’s really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.",
        "Help! Help!! Help! Help!!",
        "Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? (Imitating himself) Help! Help!",
        "Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something—or should I call it (In an English accent) football?",
        "What’s ah, what’s so funny about that?",
        "Well, we didn’t have freedom here until 1776, either so…",
        "Cheers!",
        "Oh, just hold on a second. I’m watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don’t know what the big deal is. I’m man enough to play this sport.",
        "(shocked) Hey!",
        "Hey, I can handle it! All right?",
        "That’s ‘cause-‘cause you’re mom’s dog kept-kept looking at me.",
        "And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?",
        "Well, you should’ve seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he’s like Joe Rugby.",
        "Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I’m gonna show her how tough I really am!",
        "Look, don’t worry about me. Okay? I’ll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I’ll uh, I’ll be that guy right out of the circle. (He points to a player who starts running and then gets viscously tackled from behind.)",
        "They don’t look any bigger than me!",
        "All right.",
        "Okay, I know what I have to do. I’ve got to go Red Ross. (Joey and Phoebe don’t know what he’s talking about.) Y’know, Red Ross!",
        "Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!",
        "You’ll see.",
        "JOEY!!!!!!",
        "Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!",
        "(to Emily) Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water?",
        "Thanks. (When she’s gone he collapses into Joey.) I-I think I’m dying. I really do.",
        "(to Phoebe) Tell my son that I love him. (Emily returns with the water.) Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!",
        "(whines \"No.\") That’s not true!",
        "What? No! No, I’m not stopping. I’m Red Ross!",
        "I don’t care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!",
        "No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.",
        "I like that.",
        "Huh?",
        "All right, bad ankle, got it!",
        "Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!",
        "But-but, Liam’s on my team.",
        "I’m gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in! (Squeals like a madman.)",
        "Oh no! That-that’ll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y’know what? I’m buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it’s in my pocket.",
        "No, not you. (Emily gets it.)",
        "Oh, I kinda was, wasn’t I?",
        "I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven’t done that since I was four and I washed my dad’s Porsche with rocks.",
        "Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose—I mean I-I’m not proud of it but, I really am. And it’s all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.",
        "No, no, I’m serious. Thank you.",
        "It’s worth the pain. (She goes to hug him again.) Y’know what, you know what? It’s not.",
        "Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?",
        "Now, how will they know if you’re ready?",
        "(He does so, and finds a half-eaten box of cookies.) You’re good. (Tries a cookie.) These are not.",
        "Five.",
        "Challenge extended.",
        "Challenge excepted.",
        "We’ll be starting with apples.",
        "Yes. Yes. Yes. (They’re perfect so far.)",
        "They have another guess.",
        "How did you know she would buy scotch tape?",
        "Oh sure, \"Ross will do it!\" It’s not like he has a job, or a child, or a life of his own.",
        "No-no-no, I-I wanna play.",
        "The test is ready.",
        "Okay, each team will answer ten questions. The first team that answers the most questions wins. Okay, the categories are, Fears and Pet Peeves, Ancient History, Literature, and It’s All Relative. Now, the coin toss to see who goes first. (He flips the coin and they all watch it hit the table and stop. Then they all look up at him, to see who goes first.) Okay, somebody call it this time.",
        "It’s heads. (The guys celebrate.) Gentlemen, pick your category.",
        "What is Monica’s biggest pet peeve?",
        "That’s correct. Ladies?",
        "According to Chandler, what phenomenon scares the bejeezus out of him?",
        "That is correct.",
        "Gentlemen, you’re pick.",
        "Monica and I have a grandmother who died, you both went to her funeral, name that grandmother!",
        "Althea is correct.",
        "Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joey’s apartment. What name appears on the address label?",
        "I’m afraid the TV Guide comes to Chinandolor Bong.",
        "All right, the score is nine to eight in favor of the guys. Ladies if you miss this the game is theirs, pick your category.",
        "You don’t have to shout everything.",
        "Ooh. What is the name of Chandler’s father’s Las Vegas all-male burlesque?",
        "All right, we have a tie. Luckily, I have prepared for such an event. (He opens up an envelope and holds up some note cards.) The Lightning Round!",
        "Thirty seconds, all the questions you can answer.",
        "150 dollars.",
        "200 dollars.",
        "Excuse me.",
        "All right, gentlemen, you’re up first.",
        "You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round begins—stop it (Chandler stops jumping)—now. What was Monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?",
        "Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie…",
        "Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...",
        "Correct. In what part of her body did Monica get a pencil stuck at age 14?",
        "Eww! No!! Her ear! All right, Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?",
        "Two seconds…",
        "11, unbelievable 11 is correct. (The guys celebrate.) All right, that’s 4 for the guys. Ladies, you’re up.",
        "30 seconds on the clock. 5 questions wins the game. The lightning round begins…now! What is Joey’s favorite food?",
        "Correct. Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl’s breast?",
        "No, 19.",
        "Joey, had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?",
        "Correct, his profession was?",
        "Correct! What is Chandler Bing’s job?",
        "10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.",
        "Don’t blame the questions!",
        "People can hear you.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That is one good looking man!",
        "Dude!",
        "Here’s your girlfriend’s button. (Holding the button.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates s*x with a real good lookin’ guy.",
        "Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.",
        "Yeah.",
        "They’re not a couple!",
        "Oh yeah!",
        "No.",
        "Y’know what, I don’t know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the s*x is between some guy and your girlfriend.",
        "Oh no-no-no, I’m there.",
        "Oh yeah!",
        "Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.",
        "All right, let’s not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.",
        "Here she comes. Don’t say a word, okay? Just be cool, don’t be…y'know you.",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, absolutely! (Chandler mumbles something.)",
        "Okay, I… (Walks away.)",
        "Uh, hello!",
        "Oh, yumm!",
        "Cookies and p0rn, you’re the best mom ever!!",
        "Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?",
        "Oh, whatever. (Laughs and gives Joey the thumbs up heading back to his apartment. Joey follows him)",
        "So you were right?",
        "Chandler!",
        "He’s right, what she did was unforgivable.",
        "How might you be wrong?",
        "That’s all you’re basing this on?",
        "So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?",
        "Oh my God!",
        "This is beautiful!",
        "Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?",
        "Hey!",
        "What are you saying?",
        "Well, if-if she thought they were on a break…",
        "Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Bye. (They kiss.)",
        "Oh yeah, she’s-she’s amazing. And-and she’s so much fun. And! Y’know what? When I’m with her, I’m fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes. (Chandler is shocked.) She’s leaving in two days, I don’t have to do it.",
        "Yeah, she’s got to go back to London. But you know what? I’ve been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that’s it. Y’know.",
        "Pheebs!",
        "(starts rubbing her belly) Hello! Hello!",
        "Well, as much as I’d like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren’t going to be here. All right? I mean, she’s going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I’ve got a whole special evening planned. So I’m sorry, no party.",
        "You really didn’t know?",
        "(interrupting Monica and Emily) So we should probably get going soon.",
        "Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y’know, then The Plaza for dinner.",
        "No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It’s usually, \"Surprise!\" And then, \"Oh my God, I’m so surprised—good-bye!\"",
        "Monica said that did she? (He squeezes Monica’s knee really hardly and Monica winces in pain.)",
        "Yes, we have something we have to get to.",
        "What big thing?",
        "(stopping them) Okay, that-that’s enough! Y’know, let’s, let’s let someone else play.",
        "Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.",
        "That’s okay. She’s still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it’s too late to do any of the things I had planned, so…",
        "Yeah.",
        "Helps a little.",
        "Yeah, have a seat.",
        "That’s okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn’t want it to end this way, y’know?",
        "What do you mean?",
        "Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment.",
        "You think?",
        "Hey, you’re right.",
        "Thanks. (He starts to go inside and stops.) What photo album was it?",
        "Oh my God! Those weren’t albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach! (He hurries inside and Chandler is taking out the garbage.)"

        "But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do. (Ross looks at her) All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I’ll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Hi Daddy!",
        "You remember Ross.",
        "Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.",
        "Okay.",
        "Aw honey stop! It’s not that bad.",
        "Yeah. That’s Daddy.",
        "Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I’d be serving him sneezers.",
        "So. Ross, I’ve bugged him about this a million times, he’s not gonna change.",
        "Well um, I don’t.",
        "Yeah it is, it is. (to Ross) We really, really have to do something about that.",
        "Oh Daddy, no he didn’t mean anything by that, he really didn’t.",
        "You had to do it, didn’t you? You couldn’t just leave it alone.",
        "Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. (Ross groans and rubs his neck) Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.",
        "Um. yeah.",
        "All right, look, here’s the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I’ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.",
        "Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that’s why you have got to be the bigger man here.",
        "Okay, well can’t you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?",
        "Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don’t wanna have to have a separate room for you too!! (starts to cry)",
        "(opening the door) Hi Daddy.",
        "What? What? He’s interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here.",
        "What?!",
        "He’s got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...",
        "Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.",

        "No.",
        "Yeah honey, I’m standing right there! Why didn’t you just tell him about the mole I haven’t got checked yet.",
        "Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.",
        "What song was that, Pheebs?",
        "Hey Mon!",
        "No, it's been three nights in a row.",
        "What?!",
        "Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.",

        "Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?",
        "(she leans over and kisses him on the cheek) Honey, I was wondering....",
        "Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?",
        "Hmm.",
        "You remember not having s*x in high school, right?",
        "Well honey, what about you?",
        "I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?",
        "Come on you gotta have one!",

        "Oh, really, let me see, let me see.",
        "Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.",
        "Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?",
        "Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.",
        "Were both of those Joey?",
        "Not even with your best friend.",
        "That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.",
        "Pretty much.",
        "Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.",
        "Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What?",
        "What?!!",
        "Excuse me, there was no time!",
        "Does anybody need more coffee?",
        "(sitting at a table with some of her friends) (to waitress) Oh, um, no, no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I don’t think this is.",
        "That’s all right. (to her friends) I mean hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh?",
        "Ummm, I think it’s time to see the ring again. (holds her hand out and they all scream)",
        "Yeah, I know.",
        "Oh, I don’t know. Well maybe it’s just the idea of Barry for the rest of my life. I don’t know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling, y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system. (Chandler is listening in very intensely)",
        "I’m serious, I really, I think I need just to have some...meaningless, s*x y'know, with the next guy that I see.",
        "Yeah, so?",

        "Yes, his name is Barry, he’s a doctor, thank you very much.",
        "Thank you. So how-how ‘bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?",
        "Oh, but that’s okay.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. (points at Chandler, who holds up the cue ball as a ‘Remember me?’ thing) Listen, can we please have lunch the next time I’m in the city?",
        "Okay!",
        "Bye!",
        "Don’t say anything. I don’t wanna speak, I don’t wanna think. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.",
        "What?",
        "Oh, sorry.",
        "Um, (shyly) Barry.",
        "(joining Phoebe outside) Hey Pheebs.",
        "Any sign of your brother?",
        "I thought you only met him once?",
        "Well relax, he’ll be here.",
        "Well, actually Gunther sent me. You’re not allowed to have cups out here, it’s a thing. (takes her cup and goes back inside)",
        "Now, you do realize that she’s a cartoon, and way out of your league?",
        "Oh, I don’t know, I guess, Chris O’Donnel, John F. Kennedy, Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson.",
        "Hardy Boy.",
        "What about you honey, who would be on your list?",
        "Hi!",
        "Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?",
        "Three of your five, what?",
        "Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.",
        "So?",
        "Yeah, ‘cause that’s why you won’t get Isabella Rosselini, geography.",
        "Well, it’s about time.",
        "All right let me see. (grabs the card) Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel?",
        "Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice.",
        "Oh!",
        "Come on!",
        "Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? (the guy nods) Okay, great. (she starts to walk away and under her breath) You freak.",
        "Oh-oh, you lie.",
        "Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.",
        "You know what honey, you go ahead, we’ll call her an alternate.",
        "Okay.",
        "Honey, he’s about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I’m just sorry we don’t got popcorn.",
        "What?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?",
        "(to Chandler) Eh, do you believe that?",
        "I’m gonna get back to retraining. (gets up)",
        "Gunther, Gunther, please, I’ve worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there. (points to the counter.)",
        "Huh. Well, y'know that’s actually a really good idea, because that way they’ll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.",
        "Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I’m, I’m sorry. (walks away)",
        "(sitting down next to Chandler) I’m training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.",
        "Well, yeah! I’m still pursuing that.",
        "Well, I’m also sending out.... good thoughts.",
        "The fear?",
        "Well then how come you’re still at a job that you hate, I mean why don’t you quit and get ‘the fear’?",
        "I don’t know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don’t want to be 30 and still work here.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Can’t I just look at the handles on them?",
        "Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I’m a terrible waitress? Because, I don’t care. I don’t care. I don’t care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don’t care where the tray spot is, I just don’t care, this is not what I want to do. So I don’t think I should do it anymore. I’m gonna give you my weeks notice.",
        "Gunther, I quit.",
        "(entering) Okay, stop what you’re doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....",
        "Hey-hey-hey that’s funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!",
        "I don’t know, I don’t know, weren’t you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!",
        "No, it’s not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don’t have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I’m just gonna, I’m just gonna call Gunther and I’m gonna tell him, I’m not quitting.",
        "You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....",
        "No.",
        "Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Oh, I blew it. I wouldn’t of even hired me.",
        "I can’t! It’s too late! Terry already hired that girl over there. (points to her) Look at her, she’s even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... (starts to cry) swans.",
        "(answering the phone) Hello? (listens) Yeah, this is she. (listens) Oh! You’re kidding! You’re kidding! (listens) Oh thank you! I love you!",
        "(hanging up the phone) I got the job!",
        "Here we go. I’m serving my last cup of coffee. (the gang starts humming the graduation theme) There you go. (hands it to Chandler) Enjoy. (they all cheer)",
        "Um, excuse me, everyone. Ah, this is my last night working here, and I ah, just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here, and ah, it’s just time to move on. (at the counter Gunther starts to cry and runs into the back room) Ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it feels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again.",
        "No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.",
        "Oh! That would be sooo much fun!",
        "Let’s do it! Ross?",
        "Do you wanna play football?",
        "Um, there was a Geller Cup?",
        "Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.",
        "(knocking it down instead of catching it) That almost hit me in the face.",
        "Monica, I’m your best friend.",
        "Ross!",
        "You don’t pick me! You’re stuck with me!",
        "(coming over to Ross, who is just getting up) Are you okay?",
        "Over here!",
        "(proud of her self) I almost caught that one!",
        "Wait, what am I gonna do?",
        "Wait, how long?",
        "Okay.",
        "Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it’s like all I’m doing is running back and forth from the huddle.",
        "Can I see that for second.",
        "Now, does it really matter?",
        "All right, so are we not having dinner at all?",
        "I went really long.",
        "I can not believe your trading me!!",
        "Are you gonna let me play?",
        "Yeah!!! Kill ‘um!!!",
        "No! Come on! Don’t make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.",
        "God, I’m not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.",
        "Thank you! Break!",
        "I’m so sorry! Are you okay?",
        "I’m sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn’t know what to do.",
        "(on the verge of tears) Okay.",
        "(in triumph) I got a touchdown! We did it!!",
        "We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there’s a like league we could join or something.",
        "Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.",
        "(running in from her bedroom, wearing only a towel) Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?",
        "(to Ross) Tell him.",
        "(running into the living room) Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.",
        "No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.",
        "Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.",
        "Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. (to Phoebe) Is this actually a lunchbox?",
        "Oh.",
        "Yeah. What kind of discount do we get?",
        "Oh!! I love this job! (her phone rings) Wow! My first call.",
        "Hi honey!",
        "Oh, he's just goofing around.",
        "Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants.",
        "Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?",
        "I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go. (to Mark) Mark, I need you!",
        "Ow! Ross!!",
        "Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm... (she picks up this bug and it starts to play the theme from Love Story)",
        "Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's just really romantic.",
        "Yes.",
        "All right Ross!! I get it!!",
        "You're hurt!",
        "Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!",
        "Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do.",
        "Ohhh! That is soo sweet! (gets up to get herself a cup of coffee)",
        "(now standing behind Ross) Ross!",
        "So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?",
        "Right.",
        "Hello.",
        "A big idiot.",
        "Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?",
        "Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous. (she kisses him)",
        "Where ya going?",
        "Ohh, with who?",
        "There was a woman at the... (realizes) The stripper?!",
        "You have a play date with a stripper?!",
        "Sure, is she married?",
        "Oh. (starts shaking the sugar down in a packet really hard.)",
        "Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?",
        "I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I...",
        "Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.",
        "(to Chandler) Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.",
        "Noo way, Kevin.",
        "Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with\n        his doll? (uses the Milk Master 2000 to pour milk into her\n        cereal)",
        "What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?",
        "Men are unbelievable.",
        "Amazingly, that makes sense.",
        "Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies\n        and pretend agents.",
        "Very nice touch.",
        "Unbelievable.",
        "Honey, this will help. (hands him a tub of ice cream)",
        "Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's\n        not so bad. How did you leave it?",
        "Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We\n        sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal\n        cases.",
        "Yeah, you do.",
        "This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself\n        reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get\n        your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to\n        start acting aloof.",
        "Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally\n        run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.",
        "Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.",
        "Oh.",
        "G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?",
        "Yeah, it is.",
        "Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yes, and grumpy.",
        "He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with\n        somebody else by now.",
        "Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special\n        homemade brownies? ",
        "Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!",
        "And all these people actually died?",
        "Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just\n        go.",
        "I promise.",
        "Joey, you can’t keep this to yourself, if you know about this,\n        you have to tell him.",
        "Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?",
        "(holding Ben) Look Benny, spoon. (moves it back and\n        forth) Spoon. Come on! All right, y'know what I think he’s bored.",
        "Okay. Okay honey, he’s fine, he’s fine, let’s just put him\n        down. Come here, Ben. (sets him on the couch) See that’s a good\n        boy. (to Monica) How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me,\n        what is he going to say?!",
        "We’re not?!",
        "All right, I like that. ",
        "So we’re okay, we’re okay, we’re okay, (starts to exam\n        Ben) aren’t we? No, we’re not okay, we’re not okay, there’s a\n        bump, there’s a bump.",
        "I cannot push it in!",
        "Okay, okay, okay.",
        "Okay.",
        "Or. We could put a hat on his head.",
        "We need a hat..",
        "Oh, oh, oh, I’ll get ‘Rainy Day Bear’!! (runs to get him)",
        "Oh God, oh God, it’s sowed on though.",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh!!",
        "Oh, it’s just like a bloodbath in here today.",
        "Right.",
        "See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn’t I?",
        "Okay, I heard that.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "(goes over and hits her head on the post) Look at that!\n        (repeats) Look at that! (repeats) We all do it. (repeats) Okay,\n        I’m stopping now.",
        "Oh yeah! Y'know, if it’s not a headboard, it’s just not worth\n        it.",
        "Monica, number one, I don’t think Ben understands the\n        concept of bribery, and number two, I... (Joey starts laughing\n        in the background) (to Joey) What?!",
        "I also said number one.",
        "Hi!",
        "He’s perfect, he’s never been better.",
        "Well maybe he’s just taking a nap.",
        "Well, we have gotta find out if he’s alive.",
        "Are you, are you, are you sure it’s ah, a new bump? I mean,\n        no offense, I’ve always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed\n        child.",
        "(confidently) I did!",
        "I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his\n        head against that thing!",
        "I hope it’s still funny when you’re in hell.",
        "I’ll get the hat.",
        "Hey-hey, now he’s showing us his poking device.",
        "Wow.",
        "Noo, that’s our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.",
        "Good luck.",
        "(jumping up from reading her magazine) Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.",
        "I know!",
        "Op.",
        "Oh, you got me.",
        "Oh, that sounds great.",
        "Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.",
        "Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.",
        "Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it’s remotely related to the field they’re interested in.",
        "Oh honey, come on, I’m sorry, I didn’t.... I don’t mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.",
        "(to him) Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?",
        "It’s not funny, this is actually my job.",
        "Oh well then, so I’m just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.",
        "Yes?!",
        "(looks at Monica) (to him) Do you want my pickle?",
        "(entering, to Ross) The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.",
        "Hi! So I’m out having lunch at Monica’s and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale’s and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he’s gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!",
        "I know!",
        "Uh-huh!",
        "Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.",
        "What!?",
        "To be nice.",
        "I didn’t have to, because I was wearing my ‘I heart Ross’ sandwich board and ringing my bell.",
        "Well, I assume I’ll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that’s true of any job.",
        "I mean that’s unbelievable.",
        "Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.",
        "That’s all right.",
        "Hey. (they all walk away from Chandler)",
        "Did he call? Did Mark call?",
        "Oh. (we hear laughing from the upstairs apartment) Oh my God, is that Phoebe?",
        "Music. Very nice.",
        "So, how are you?",
        "Oh yeah, what’s it about?",
        "Yeah, I do. (they both run out)",
        "I can’t believe Mark didn’t call. It’s Sunday night, and he didn’t call.",
        "(to Ross) Yeah, right. Look at you, you’re practically giddy.",
        "Yeah, and you don’t mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.",
        "(on phone) Hello, Mark? Hi, it’s Rachel Green. (listens) Oh no, don’t you apologize. (listens) Yeah, I’ll hold. (to Monica and Ross) He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.",
        "(on phone) Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it’s perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! (hangs up phone) I got the interview!",
        "He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.",
        "I got to figure out what I’m going to wear.",
        "Yeah! Right! Okay, I’ll see you guys later. (starts to leave) Woo hoo!",
        "(getting of the elevator and noticing Ross) Hey!",
        "What are you doing here?",
        "Oh.",
        "Hi.",
        "Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn’t shut up.",
        "Me too!",
        "I know.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah. (turns around) Hi Mark!",
        "Oh, I did!",
        "(to Ross) Oh my God!! (she turns around and hugs Mark, not Ross)",
        "Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.",
        "Honey, I’m sorry.",
        "Hi, sweetie!",
        "I’ve got some bad news.",
        "I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.",
        "Nooo, he’s leaving for a better job.",
        "Well we’re gonna miss you around here.",
        "Yeah, you bet.",
        "Funny book?",
        "Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn’t mind.",
        "Oh, please tell me it’s not because I’m going with Mark.",
        "Oh my God!!! Ross!!",
        "Because, he’s my friend.",
        "Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?",
        "I don’t know, you thought ‘See you Saturday’ was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.",
        "Really!?",
        "Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. (Ross has a worried look on his face) What?",
        "Oh. (puts her hand over his mouth)",
        "Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father’s boat didn’t make that much noise when it hit rocks!",
        "Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he’s ‘Hey everybody! Remember that thing that’s been dead for a gazillion years. Well there’s this little bone we didn’t know it had!’",
        "Okay, see now, what I just heard: blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.",
        "Oh, that is so...",
        "Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn’t go with Mark?",
        "It’s not dumb. But, maybe it’s okay that you’re not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? (Ross looks confused) I mean it’s like, I-I-I like that you’re not involved in that part of my life.",
        "Honey see, it doesn’t mean that I don’t love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it’s-it’s for me y'know, I’m out there, on my own, and I’m doing it and it’s scary but I love it, because it’s mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?",
        "What?!!",
        "You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you’ve got a girlfriend?",
        "(shocked) Oh my God.",
        "Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.",
        "No. A break from us.",
        "Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don’t want to take a break.",
        "Nobody.",
        "Umm, honey, look he just came over to....",
        "Hey.",
        "Well, we never actually got to dinner.",
        "No, we kinda broke up instead.",
        "(looking up at the ceiling) God, Monica it’s on the ceiling.",
        "Yeah, but it’s okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.",
        "No.",
        "No, no-no, it’s okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work.",
        "(on answering machine) Hi, it’s me. I’ve been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.",
        "Eh, I’m just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I don’t want to get back together over a machine.",
        "So, I love you.",
        "And y'know what, I’m gonna, I’m gonna go to bed now, but ah, on my way to work tomorrow morning, I’m gonna stop by around 8:30.",
        "Bye.",
        "Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.",
        "So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?",
        "I can’t talk to you. I can’t even look at you right now!",
        "Just get away from me!",
        "A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!",
        "Ross, you had s*x with another woman!",
        "(opening the door) Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!",
        "Just get out! Now!!",
        "Okay! All right! How was she?",
        "Was she good?",
        "Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let’s talk about it!! How was she?",
        "Good different?",
        "Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? (Ross can’t answer that) Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!",
        "And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!",
        "We were on a break!",
        "You think you’re gonna get out of this on a technicality?",
        "Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!",
        "God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!",
        "Oh, that is so sweet. I think I’m falling in love with you all over again.",
        "All right. Let’s say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?",
        "You’d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?",
        "You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....",
        "I’m thinking, I’m gonna order a pizza.",
        "Fine. (on phone) Hi! Yes, I’d like to order a large pizza.",
        "With ah, extra anchovies.",
        "Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?",
        "Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.",
        "That’s....",
        "That is neither here nor there.",
        "No Ross!! (stands up and moves away from him) Don’t! You can’t just kiss me and think you’re gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn’t work that way. It doesn’t just make it better. Okay?",
        "(softly) I think you should go.",
        "(softly) I really think you need to go now.",
        "Yeah, what the hell did I know!",
        "(crying) No. I can’t, you’re a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can’t stop picturing with her, I can’t, (Ross stands up and backs away) it doesn’t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It’s just changed, everything. Forever.",
        "Then how come it is?",
        "Hey!",
        "Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.",
        "Closer than here?",
        "Wait, I’m not just gonna drink somebody’s old coffee.",
        "(softly) Is he here?",
        "Oh. (smiles) Here’s your moisturiser. Hi!",
        "You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. (they’re all silent and look away) Okay, I said that out loud right?",
        "Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.",
        "Hm-mm.",
        "Ohh!",
        "Oh, it’s okay. (starts to leave)",
        "And heels.",
        "No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that’s only fair. (leaves)",
        "Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I’m asking you first, right?!. I mean I’m playing by the rules.",
        "Chandler! You’re smoking? What are you doing?!",
        "Okay.",
        "No. Thank you.",
        "Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is ‘no tissue, no tuschy.’ (Phoebe laughs and gets out.) Well, if everybody’s going. (She gets out and starts to close the door.)",
        "What?!",
        "What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra.",
        "No, I stuff outside the bra.",
        "(seeing him) Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.",
        "What, what’s it, what’s going on?",
        "So you know how to fix it?",
        "Great!",
        "Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.",
        "I don’t know, I’m sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.",
        "Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.",
        "No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!",
        "No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you’ll have to think of something else.",
        "(all excited) Op, op, car! Car!! (sees it’s Ross) Ugh!!!",
        "What is he doing here?!",
        "All right!! Fine! Fine.",
        "Ask me what?",
        "You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.",
        "Why would you even want to come Ross? You’re a horrible skier.",
        "All right, let’s go!",
        "Oh, I’m sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?",
        "Y'know Ross why don’t you put that on your answering machine!",
        "(to Monica) What?!",
        "Really Joey?",
        "No, I think it’s very obvious who’s wrong here.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Thank you.",
        "(looking at her watch) Oh my God, I gotta go to work!",
        "Oh I don’t know honey. It’s gonna be really late.",
        "I know. I’m sorry. Look, I’ll make a deal with you all right? Okay?",
        "For every night that you’re asleep before I get home from work...",
        "I will wake you up in a way that’s proved very popular in the past.",
        "Right.",
        "Somebody got in late last night.",
        "When did this happen?",
        "Monica, what are you doing?",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "Do you have any ice?",
        "Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?",
        "Hmm. (she opens the freezer) Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?",
        "But ah, you’re safe from it if it’s in the freezer?",
        "How often do you read it?",
        "Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that’s a classic, what’s so great about The Shining?",
        "Okay. Ah, well we’ll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, (she tries to take the book away from him but he doesn’t want to let it go) and you will read Little Women.",
        "All right.",
        "Okay.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, Danny just went into room 217.",
        "Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you’re gonna ruin it!",
        "Joey! I can’t believe you just did that!",
        "All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she’s still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.",
        "Eh. Beth dies.",
        "Um-hmm.",
        "What?!",
        "No. She doesn’t die.",
        "Because, I wanted to hurt you.",
        "(gasps) Oh my....",
        "(screams and grabs a potato masher to defend herself) Sorry. I’m sorry.",
        "I’m sorry, I was just thinking you’re day could still pick up.",
        "What?",
        "Awwww.",
        "Joey?",
        "Do you want to put the book in the freezer?",
        "Okay.",
        "Well, I’m really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit. (hands him an audio cassette)",
        "Come on, it’s a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn’t smoked since.",
        "(to Ross) What’s your problem?",
        "Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.",
        "Oh right, ‘cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.",
        "Oh, y'know what, I didn’t want cinnamon on this.",
        "Oh my God!! Great!",
        "Well, that shouldn’t be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.",
        "(laughs) Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain’t a pretty picture in the morning, y’know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.",
        "I think you should definitely go out with this guy.",
        "Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker: Texas Ranger?",
        "All right.",
        "Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Thank you.",
        "Hey Mon, let’s give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.",
        "We use it!!",
        "Oh my God, Monica’s gonna go out with a millionaire.",
        "Oh my God, I can’t believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.",
        "Oh yeah, sure, that too.",
        "Oh my God! The millionaire’s here!",
        "Hi!!",
        "Just one drink?!",
        "(answering her phone at work) Hello.",
        "Oh, hi.",
        "Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I’ve got to get this order in. Honey, I’m so sorry, but it looks like I’m gonna be here all night.",
        "No-no-no, no, honey please, I’ve got, I’ve just have so much to deal with.",
        "(on the phone) No, no, no, I’m looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And.... (listens) What does it matter, what I’m wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor? (listens) Thank you. (to Sophie) We’re holding.",
        "(startled) Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?",
        "Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.",
        "Honey, honey, I’m sorry, I know it’s our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don’t have time to stop.",
        "But I don’t, hmm... (on phone) Oh, who approved that order?! (listens) Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office. (to Sophie) Get me Mark on the phone!",
        "Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is not the number for (Ross starts making a lot of noise with a handheld pepper grinder) this store, 038 is Atlanta. And I...(stops and looks at Ross)",
        "(angrily) None for me.",
        "I’m sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I’m sorry but that’s... (notices a fire that Ross’s candle has started) Oh my God!!",
        "(on phone) Excuse me, I’m sorry, I’m gonna have to call you back, I’ve got a Schemp in my office. (hangs up) (to Ross) What are you doing?",
        "Ross you’re not listening to me, I don’t have time to stop.",
        "I don’t have ten minutes!!",
        "Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don’t!",
        "Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I’ve got a deadline, would you just go home, I’ll talk to you later. (storms out)",
        "Good bye!",
        "Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...",
        "(throws her stuff down) I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.",
        "You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody’s work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!",
        "But I told you, I didn’t have the time!",
        "Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?",
        "Just a job!",
        "Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I’m doing something that I’m actually good at. I mean. if you don’t get that...",
        "Well neither do I!",
        "(shocked) Oh my God.",
        "Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you’re, you’re, you’re making this too hard.",
        "I don’t know, I don’t know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.",
        "No. (Ross is standing in the doorway.) A break from us.",
        "(jumping up to answer the phone) Hello!",
        "(disappointed) Oh.",
        "No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!",
        "Yeah. Well, umm.....",
        "(on the verge of tears) Yeah, I’m fine.",
        "No! Really, no, please, please, that’s, that’s okay.",
        "Oh, yeah, I’m not, I’m not hungry.",
        "Oh. Okay, bye.",
        "Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don’t want to take a break.",
        "No. (grabs an eggroll) And then I called him, and he wasn’t there.",
        "Oh, thank you that’s very helpful, I’m glad you came over.",
        "Hello.",
        "Hi! Oh, I’m so glad you called.",
        "Nobody.",
        "Umm, honey, look he just came over to....",
        "(picks up the phone and calls Ross) Oh, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, you’re not home.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Hi! All right, let’s go shoppin’!!",
        "Oh, okay.",
        "Wow! Umm....",
        "I know.",
        "Well, I told him I would think about it, but I’m gonna tell him no.",
        "I mean I think I’d say no to anybody right now. (Hearing this Gunther swoops back to cleaning tables.) Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I’m standing there with this charming, cute guy, who’s asking me to go out with him, which I’m allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I’d be cheating on Ross or something.",
        "I don’t have any issues with my Father.",
        "Hi!",
        "Yeah. Ahh, here’s a box of your stuff. (hands him a box)",
        "Oh, y'know, it’s just like hats, and a shirt, and CD’s, just sort of stuff that you’ve left here.",
        "No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it’s time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don’t’ you think?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Good.",
        "Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.",
        "Okay, all right, give me the mug! I’ll keep the mug.",
        "You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!",
        "Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....",
        "Petty... (goes into her room)",
        "Petty...",
        "Small...",
        "You are so just doing this out of spite.",
        "Huh?",
        "You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn’t even fit you anymore!",
        "(imitating him) yeah-yeah-yeah!!",
        "Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, ‘Where’s number 27?!’",
        "Y'know what?",
        "I can’t do this.",
        "Well, oh, Mark, I’m doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I’m just doing it to get back at Ross. I’m sorry, it’s not very fair to you.",
        "Oh God. I’m sorry about this.",
        "You sure?",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn’t a chair.",
        "Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I’m just gonna throw it out, it’s probably just a bunch of shampoo and... (she opens the box and stops)",
        "(She takes the T-shirt out of the box and holds it to her chest and take a deep breath.) No. Nothing. (She smiles and goes into her room.)",
        "Hey, Sophie!",
        "Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn’t have to walk me all the way back up here.",
        "Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don’t keep the women’s lingerie here in the office?",
        "Summer catalogue! (hands him the catalogue)",
        "(introduces them) Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing (to Chandler) Joanna.",
        "Bye, Chandler.",
        "Oh, nothing, he’s just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore.",
        "No!! No! He’s not married, or involved, with anyone!",
        "Well, I’ll ask him for you, if you want me too?",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "I need to talk to you!",
        "Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.",
        "Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...",
        "(looks at him) That was (pause) surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?",
        "Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she’s gonna love me.",
        "Wow!!",
        "What’s this?",
        "All right!",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Ooohhhh!!",
        "Ahhhh!!",
        "(to Chandler) O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.",
        "Hmm.",
        "What?!",
        "Oh, I....",
        "Oh, I know...",
        "Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you’re going to call her?",
        "You can’t just say, ‘Nice to meet you, good night?’",
        "Well, they always called.",
        "No. Sorry.",
        "Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.",
        "Well...",
        "No. I...",
        "(grabbing the magazine out of his hands) Call her! Call her now!",
        "Why hasn’t he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don’t understand. Why? He said he’ll call. Why? Why? Chandler I’m telling you she has flipped out, she’s gone crazy!",
        "Come on, this isn’t funny. She thinks it’s my fault that you haven’t called her. You have to call her!",
        "Well then you’re going to have to take her out again.",
        "I don’t care! I don’t care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it’s actually ended. And, I don’t care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!",
        "That’s fine!",
        "I know.",
        "Sophie’s desk.",
        "(whispering) Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!",
        "Chandler!!",
        "Okay, you are going to tell her and you’re going to tell her now. (She grabs his nipple and starts to twist it.)",
        "Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold? I was supposed to call my Dad back like two hours ago.",
        "What’s Flimby’s?",
        "Okay. Hang up! That’s it! Come on!",
        "I had one.",
        "No. No, not at all, not at all. I actually was gonna bring someone myself, so…",
        "I meant, me plus one!",
        "Okay, bye-bye!",
        "Okay, I need a date! (runs to her bedroom)",
        "Oh, hi!",
        "How are you? (She goes to kiss him on the cheek, but stops because of the dates and pats him on the shoulder.)",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah, looks that way. First ones here! Wooo!!",
        "Oh! Tommy, this is Ross. Ross, Tommy.",
        "Okay, uhh, I think I’m going to run to the ladies room.",
        "Oh, hi!",
        "Hey. Gosh, you look soo familiar.",
        "We’re not actors.",
        "Hey!",
        "What time is it?",
        "Tommy’s supposed to be here soon, we’re going to lunch.",
        "You don’t?!",
        "Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.",
        "(not seeing Ross) What’s your favourite thing about summertime?",
        "Yeah…",
        "Tommyyyy! Say, what’s your favourite thing about summer?",
        "Ross, would you just stop it! It’s getting really old.",
        "Phoe-be!!",
        "So who’s idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?",
        "What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?",
        "And you’re still not attracted to him at all?",
        "Yeah, but Mon that’s totally different. He was you’re health\n        teacher.",
        "Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me\n        yesterday.",
        "I know. ",
        "Ow!!",
        "(looking at the outfit) Got a job on a river boat?",
        "Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.",
        "Now that you’re on you’re own, you’re free to look as stupid\n        as you like.",
        "Yeah, come here!",
        "Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!",
        "(she reaches for the bottle) Oww! (She grabs the bottle, but\n        has trouble opening it. She pops the top off and aspirins fly\n        all over the place as Ross enters.)",
        "(She bends over to try and pick up the aspirin) Oww!",
        "I’m fine, I’m fine.",
        "Yes I am! ",
        "Look, I’m fine. Watch. (She picks up an aspirin between her\n        toes) Look at that. (She lifts her leg to grab the aspirin\n        with her hand and almost falls over.) Whoa-whoa!",
        "No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses\n        house. It’s a very big deal, there’s a lot of people there I\n        have to meet.",
        "Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it’ll still be\n        broken then.",
        "But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready.",
        "Look, either help me or go.",
        "(with a hurt expression on her face) Okay, but before you go,\n        could you help me first?",
        "(She drops the brush) Y'know what? I cannot do this with my\n        left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?",
        "(taking the brush back) Okay. Let’s use this brush. (Hands him\n        another one.)",
        "Yeah.",
        "Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across\n        the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.",
        "Oh-ho!",
        "Hey! That’s just poking me in the eye!",
        "Okay, just sweep it.",
        "Right.",
        "Okay, now make it even, ‘cause we don’t...",
        "We don’t want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.",
        "Since when, since when do you think I don’t wear enough of\n        this?",
        "Blow it.",
        "Sophisticated like a hooker?",
        "Sure.",
        "Sure, I’ll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing.",
        "Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?",
        "Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.",
        "I don’t want you to see me naked!",
        "Yeah, but that was different. Y’know? I mean, we were, we were\n        going out then, now I think it’s weird.",
        "What?",
        "Ross! Stop that!",
        "Come on! I don’t want you thinking of me like that any more!",
        "Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!",
        "Rosss...",
        "All right. (She starts to take off her robe) Fine.",
        "O-kay!! See what you did, I’m gonna be doing it by myself now.\n        Okay? ",
        "That’s it. (She crawls onto the bed) Ow!!! ",
        "Oh-ow!",
        "Ow!",
        "Ow!",
        "Ow!",
        "Ow! Ow!",
        "Okay, I do. ",
        "I really do.",
        "Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you’re not gonna come with me?",
        "Okay.",
        "Thank you. (She goes to take off her make-up and screams in\n        pain) Oww!!!! God!",
        "I’m sorry, I just can’t go to the hospital lookin’ like this.",
        "Okay, you’d tell me the truth. Right?",
        "Okay.",
        "What thing? What thing?",
        "What thing? What is this thing?",
        "Oh my God! ",
        "Ross, why didn’t you tell me that?",
        "I cannot believe you.",
        "That is the sweetest thing, I just....",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh, I’m sorry I spoiled you’re evening.",
        "Um-hmm, yeah.",
        "(After he closes the door) See ya.",
        "(entering, interrupting them) Hey guys! What's... (sees what they're doing and stops, the guys are stunned)",
        "Hi!",
        "Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?",
        "Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher.",
        "What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.",
        "Hi!",
        "And?",
        "Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?",
        "So Pheebs, pick one of them.",
        "(entering with Phoebe) This place is amazing.",
        "(standing up) Ahh... Chandler's on the couch!!",
        "Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!",
        "Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, “Look how much money we’ve got!” Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it’ll be dry, but people will like it.",
        "Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!",
        "OH MY GOD!!! (She holds her hands up in triumph and the gang all look at her.) Sorry, I was just imagining what it’d be like to catch the money bouquet.",
        "(entering) Hi! Okay, don’t be mad at me, but I couldn’t resist.",
        "Yes, and I know that you’d say no if he asked you, but I’m sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin. (shows her the picture.)",
        "Oh my God. (starting to cry)",
        "You didn’t break up with that fireman?",
        "Wow!",
        "Oh, you’re welcome a million.",
        "(softly) Oh my God.",
        "Whoa! What?! Why?!",
        "Here?! Now?!",
        "Well, can’t you tell her that you are not in the mood?",
        "(interrupting) Whoa-ho.",
        "I don’t know.",
        "Oh, making it worse!",
        "Oh, was it awful?",
        "I wrote you a letter.",
        "(handing him the letter) It’s just some things I’ve been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.",
        "Well, I’ll be waiting for you, just come up when you’re done.",
        "(coming down the stairs) Hey! (Ross jumps up, and quickly puts the letter back together, pretending like he has just finished it.) What happened to you? Why didn’t you come up?",
        "You just finished?",
        "So umm, does it?",
        "Does it?",
        "What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn’t, and if you have to even think about it...",
        "Are you sure?",
        "I know. (Hugs him more violently this time and pushes him back away from the letter.)",
        "How was the beach?",
        "Ooh, I have to go pack. (Gets up to do so.) It really does?",
        "All right, that’s it, you guys! What happened out there?",
        "Come on!",
        "Ewwww!!",
        "(turning to look at Joey) Ewwww!!",
        "Oh-hooo, I missed you.",
        "Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you’ve grown. Y'know?",
        "You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, “Once a cheater, always a cheater.”",
        "Ooh, I just wish we hadn’t lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...",
        "Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!",
        "What?!!",
        "You fell asleep?!",
        "Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!",
        "Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you’re at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!",
        "(to Monica) Sorry!! (to Ross) I just feel bad about all that sleep you’re gonna miss wishing you were with me!",
        "And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!",
        "Good! ‘Cause I’ve got a product report to read, it’s like eight pages, I hope I don’t fall asleep.",
        "(sees Chip’s phone number) Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?",
        "(interrupting) I bet he sensed that I was ready to have s*x with another guy.",
        "Okay. (picks up phone) Are you sure you wanna hear this?",
        "(on phone) Chip! Hi, it’s Rachel. (listens) Rachel Green. Yeah, umm, you left me a message. (listens) Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. (listens) Monica Geller. (listens) Ohh.",
        "Why? I love that thing.",
        "Oh no.",
        "Something to do with numbers?",
        "What?",
        "You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!",
        "Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you’re going out with Chip Matthews?",
        "Nooo! It’s not okay! I can’t believe you would want to after what he did to me!",
        "Monica! I couldn’t find him for two hours! He was having s*x with Amy Welch!",
        "I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!",
        "Okay, that doesn’t help me, because we went to the same high school.",
        "(shocked) They had to have that specially made?!",
        "(stunned) Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!",
        "Oh, you go out with him. (goes over and hugs her) ",
        "Yeah. Just, if it’s possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have s*x with another guy?",
        "I believe it.",
        "Yes, I do.",
        "Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.",
        "Jurassic Park could happen.",
        "(entering) You guys, you’re never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! (She’s holding a flyer.) Look kinda familiar?",
        "You guys, there’s a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!",
        "Do we have to tell her?",
        "I hate when Ross is right!",
        "Pheebs...",
        "All right!!",
        "Jeez!",
        "Hello, Chip.",
        "I’m great! I’m great. I’ve got a great job at Bloomingdale’s, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I’m not seeing anyone right now, I’ve never felt better about myself.",
        "She’ll be out in a second. So, Chip, how’s umm, Amy Welch?",
        "Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.",
        "(to Monica) So, how was your date?",
        "Um-hmm.",
        "Oh honey, I’m sorry.",
        "Ohh! That’s so great!",
        "I’m sorry, sweetie. (shows her the flyer)",
        "That’s a good call. Right.",
        "You could.... say you’re sorry to her mom.",
        "So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?",
        "I’ll go with you.",
        "How’d it go with Pete?!",
        "So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?",
        "Why?! What is it?",
        "Yes!!",
        "Y'know I don’t, I don’t understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin’ her boob.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, ah with who?",
        "Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?",
        "Oh! (laughs) That’s fine.",
        "(to Phoebe) Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?",
        "This is Bonnie? (to Phoebe) This is Bonnie? (to Bonnie) You’re Bonnie?",
        "Oh no, I’m sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.",
        "Oh, that must be it.",
        "(to Phoebe) You said she was bald.",
        "How could you not tell me that she has hair?",
        "(looks in the window) Ohh, well, this is just perfect!",
        "Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!",
        "Why, does she have a bad personality?",
        "(seeing Ross and Bonnie inside Central Perk) Oh my God! Phoebe look, it’s Ross and that girl.",
        "Phoebe! (goes back to the window)",
        "Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that’s, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that’s what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...",
        "Ohh! (walking away from the window) Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he’s gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.",
        "You said she was bald!!",
        "Phoebe, we can’t, we just can’t just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!",
        "(quietly) Yes.",
        "Yes.",
        "I just y'know, I didn’t expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh! (sits down on the curb)",
        "What?",
        "Oh!",
        "Oh, I can’t watch this. (turns her eyes away)",
        "(to Monica) I mean is that woman capable of talking about\n        anything else but s*x?",
        "That is so cool.",
        "(sarcastic) Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.",
        "(approaching) Hey! ",
        "Ross gave it to me.",
        "Ohh, thank you.",
        "Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell\n        you that hats are back.",
        "Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!",
        "(to Monica) Allll done!",
        "Okay, who’s next?! (She looks around the room, and stops when\n        she comes to Ross.)",
        "Come on, please?! I’m boredddd! You let me do it once before.",
        "Yes! (she starts creeping up on him)",
        "Just once! ",
        "Take it like a man, Ross!",
        "Oh, come on!",
        "Really?!",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "(reading a card) Okay, your band is playing at Arnold’s,\n        collect three cool points. Which means, I have five, and that\n        means I get Joey’s boxers!",
        "(getting up) All right, I’m gonna make more margaritas! (She\n        pours the rest of the pitcher into Ross’s glass.)",
        "I’m just making margaritas.",
        "What?! ",
        "Oh, come on!",
        "Monica, please?",
        "(pause) He is, isn’t he? I don’t know, I don’t know, I mean\n        maybe it’s just being here at the beach together or, I don’t\n        know. But it’s like something... (she’s interrupted by the\n        sound of Bonnie entering)",
        "(entering) Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?!",
        "Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn’t up yet. Did you guys\n        hear them last night?",
        "Oh, great.",
        "I’m going for a walk.",
        "Oh, ah nothin’. I just felt like hangin’ out here and reading.",
        "Ohhhh, sorry I missed that.",
        "Ohh-ha-ha!",
        "Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were\n        bald.",
        "Ohh!",
        "Really?!",
        "I mean you definitely should do that.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!",
        "Aww Pheebs, that sucks!",
        "Hi!",
        "That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge.",
        "Hey!",
        "Come on see, she doesn’t look that bad.",
        "I don’t know.",
        "All right! Ross, do you think it’s easy for me to see you with\n        somebody else?",
        "Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving\n        you!",
        "Noo.",
        "Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!",
        "Noo! Maybe! I, I don’t know. Ross, I still can’t forgive you\n        for what you did, I can’t, I just, but sometimes when I’m with\n        you I just, I feel so...",
        "I just, I feel, I-I just...",
        "I feel...",
        "Well! Good night. (to Ross) I’m going upstairs.",
        "What?",
        "Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.",
        "Well, I thought you liked doing it. (Rachel starts out the door and stops.)",
        "Right!",
        "Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.",
        "Ummm. Oh! I’m sorry. (She grabs the box and offers him a piece.) It’s a little old but…",
        "I’m sorry. I didn’t—I don’t come in here a lot.",
        "No.",
        "I didn’t… I never said that.",
        "(starting to cry) Okay, I’m sorry. (Runs out still carrying the pizza box.)",
        "Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.",
        "That’s easy for you to say, you weren’t almost just killed.",
        "Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?",
        "Oh! My hero! What happened?",
        "What?! You got us evicted!!",
        "That’s not true! (Starts to cry.)",
        "Go!!",
        "Well, why doesn’t he practice with a girl?",
        "Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that…garbage chute. (Starts to cry)",
        "Hey! So, did you quit?",
        "Oh, umm, I was just y’know working out and umm… Oh, that’s it.",
        "Where?!",
        "(laughing) What was that?",
        "You just did a little dancy thing.",
        "You are soo enjoying this.",
        "Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.",
        "What are you ever gonna use that for?!",
        "You got fired?!",
        "Sweety...",
        "Oh! Good thing Chandler’s not here, he always wins at this game.",
        "(entering) Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?",
        "My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must’ve been awkward.",
        "(laughs) You ah, you didn’t say ‘Yes’ to that did you?",
        "What is she doing here?",
        "I don’t understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a ‘big, dull dud.’",
        "Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!",
        "Chandler!! (He turns around quickly) Promise me, you will end it.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Oh yeah, I totally agree.",
        "That’s weird, she locked the door.",
        "Okay, swear you won’t tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna’s office. Do you wanna see the list?",
        "(answering it) (angrily) What?!",
        "You promised you would break up with her!",
        "And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!",
        "Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.",
        "Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! (Grabs the key) You never see Joanna again!",
        "You never come into this office again!",
        "You give me back my Walkman!",
        "Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!",
        "Does it hurt?",
        "Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?",
        "When she sees that you’re gone, she’s gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I’m gonna get fired!",
        "No, there’s nothing to make up, she’s gonna know that I have a key to her office, I’ve got to get you locked up back the way you were! (She tries to drag him over to the chair, but Chandler stops her.)",
        "Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she’s very private about her office. Now I know why.",
        "What if I clean your bathroom for a month?",
        "Foot rubs for a month!",
        "I’ll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!",
        "Sophie sit!!",
        "No! God, would you just calm down!",
        "I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.",
        "I ah… Oh! I’ll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!",
        "(happily) Yeah!!",
        "D’oh!! (pause) I’ve got it!",
        "I have so got it. There’s gonna be rumours about this, there’s no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.",
        "Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous (Holds her hands far apart) or very (In a high pitched voice) stingy.",
        "I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation’s Milton Berle.",
        "Ohh, not compared to you. (Chandler nods in agreement)",
        "So did you break up with Joanna?",
        "What?!",
        "It’s me! Good morning!",
        "Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn’t have poppy seed bagels, so I… (Enters Joanna’s office and sees her handcuffed to her chair wearing nothing but a slip) Oh my word!",
        "Oh, yeah! Yeah!",
        "Okay.",
        "Yeah?",
        "May fifth, why?",
        "Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her.",
        "Well, have fun!",
        "Yeah, she's...",
        "You love her.",
        "(entering, with a guy) Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross.",
        "Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.",
        "Okay. (He starts to leave, and Rachel grabs him and gives him a passionate kiss.) I'll miss you.",
        "I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum.",
        "Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?",
        "What was that?",
        "Oh. (She tries to walk away from Josh, by he keeps holding her) Stop it!",
        "Yeah! (Monica gives a sarcastic thumbs up) (Josh leaves) I am soo gonna marry that guy. (looking in her wallet) Ohhh!",
        "I think he's stealing from me.",
        "Because he's stealing from me!",
        "Ughh! (Storms out after him)",
        "Well where's Amanda?",
        "I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.",
        "Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.",
        "(laughing) Ohh, that is soo sad.",
        "Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it! (Shows her, her ring)",
        "Sorry.",
        "Y'know...",
        "Yeah.",
        "No!",
        "(confused) Okay.",
        "(really confused) Okay.",
        "Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!",
        "Oh, I can’t believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.",
        "Why not?",
        "Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.",
        "Yeah, Phoebe you’re… awful!",
        "I know, I remember that!",
        "Well, Chandler, you’re gonna have to tell him.",
        "Because you do.",
        "Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.",
        "What?",
        "Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?",
        "Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.",
        "Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!",
        "Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?",
        "Oh, honey, that's so sweet.",
        "Oh my God! What happened?",
        "Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.",
        "And not one of your coupons for an hour of \"Joey Love.\"",
        "No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.",
        "Hey, how'd it go?",
        "You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.",
        "And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?",
        "No....",
        "Yes! Rent!",
        "What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.",
        "What did you get her? (Joey opens up a rectangular black box and holds up a pen.)",
        "Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?",
        "Any luck?",
        "All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.",
        "Aw, honey, that's so sweet.",
        "Oh! Pathetic! (Grabs the crossword puzzle and starts writing.)",
        "I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to hug!",
        "Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!",
        "Thanks!",
        "Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go?",
        "So are things with you and Joey any better?",
        "Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?",
        "You shouldn’t.",
        "Well, I’m gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.",
        "I know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, I just… (goes into her bedroom.)",
        "(standing in her doorway) People are trying to sleep in here!",
        "Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.",
        "Ooh, so cute, that I’m thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.",
        "I know, it’s sick.",
        "Because it’s Richard’s son! It’s like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!",
        "Is he okay in there?",
        "So now, what exactly is the point of the box?",
        "(worried) Why?",
        "Okay. (She goes into her bedroom)",
        "(coming out of her bedroom with a necklace) Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.",
        "Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.",
        "Well isn’t it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?",
        "Credit.",
        "Ooh, I like those sunglasses.",
        "(Swears in Italian, it’s the same term used by Joey earlier and Joey nods his approval.)",
        "Fancy soap? I thought we were savin’ that for the Pope!",
        "(pouring the wine) Sick-sick-sick-sick.",
        "Ross, can you pass me the yams?",
        "Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!",
        "Okay, fine. (She gets up and walks into her bedroom)",
        "Don’t say that I have no sentiment! (Starts to show Ross what’s in the box.) This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! (Holds up a bone) This is from the museum from the first time we… were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!",
        "Joey, had reasons.",
        "What?!",
        "Oh, he sees her!",
        "Hey, y’know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it’ll be Valentine’s Day, then my birthday, then bang!—before you know it, they’re lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! (hearing this, Gunther moves in) Y’know, I want a man!! (Gunther leaves depressed) I mean, it doesn’t even have to be a big relationship, y’know, just like a fling would be great.",
        "Well, believe me, it’s been a long time since I’ve been flung.",
        "Yeah! Wait a minute, it’s been a long time that I’ve been single. How come you never offered this before?",
        "Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don’t like guys with boring jobs.",
        "Hey, honey! What’s the matter? (Monica shows her, her hat.) Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!",
        "Well, wait a minute, you’re the boss! Why don’t you just yell at them? Or, fire them?",
        "Pheebs, that’s great!",
        "But y’know umm, Rachel doesn’t rhyme with draddle.",
        "Oh yeah!",
        "Really?!",
        "So, will I like any of these guys?",
        "Chandler!",
        "Ohh, I like swimmer’s bodies!",
        "Op, I like credit cards!",
        "Well, so what does he do?",
        "Your company has a fine foods division?",
        "(entering) Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!",
        "Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.",
        "Well, y'know, possibly. (pause) You didn’t tell him that, though? Right?",
        "You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don’t tell the guy that!",
        "Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date—oh, he’s so gonna get the wrong idea.",
        "Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?",
        "You idiot!!",
        "You don’t tell a guy that you’re looking for a serious relationship! You don’t tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!",
        "Y’know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!",
        "Oh! See just I’m right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks! (She sits down heavily in one of the new chairs)",
        "Really?",
        "No.",
        "Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.",
        "Well that sounds fun too. (They hug.)",
        "What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!",
        "No?",
        "Oh!",
        "Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There’s an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss…",
        "Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and…",
        "God, I am so glad you don’t have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn’t even consider applying.",
        "(interrupting) And that’s I’m so glad… there’s no problem.",
        "Ohh! That’s great!",
        "Really?!",
        "Well, I, umm…",
        "Thank you.",
        "Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.",
        "Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.",
        "I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.",
        "Yes, I realize that…",
        "I love working with designers!",
        "(entering Joanna’s office) Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.",
        "No! It didn’t! That’s what I want to talk to you about. (starts to break up) Now, just to brief you… (starts to cry) I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.",
        "There’s nobody here!",
        "Do you want me to quit?",
        "Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y’know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, (She goes over to get all of her belongings from the desk, which amount to a muffin and a pen) and I will be gone by the end of the day! (Realizes she has nothing.) Well, I guess there’s no use to me sticking around ‘til the end of the day! (Starts to leave.)",
        "What?",
        "My drinking?",
        "Said what? Exactly.",
        "Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I’m leaving! You are just a horrible person!",
        "Say more things like that.",
        "I’d need an expense account.",
        "And an assistant.",
        "Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?",
        "Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I’m soo happy!",
        "Ohh, you’ve waited soo long.",
        "Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.",
        "How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale’s?",
        "Yes!!!",
        "Ohh, it’s gonna be so great! I’m gonna get to help decide what we sell, I’m gonna have an office with walls and everything. (turns to Monica) I’m gonna have walls!",
        "I’m an assistant buyer!!",
        "Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?",
        "Heard what?",
        "Oh my God! How?!",
        "Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!",
        "Oh, God. Oh, God. (gets worried) Oh God.",
        "Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before… it happened.",
        "Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she’d still be with us—nothing about an assistant buyer?",
        "Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn’t hear about Joanna…",
        "How does going to a strip club help him better?",
        "Um-hmm. (Joshua turns to look in the mirror and leaves Rachel staring at his ass.) There we go. There it is.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Oh, okay. Uhh, well let’s see. (Grabs his hand.) You’re about—well uh, this one is large. And this one—(Grabs the other hand.)",
        "Yeah! Okay, two larges coming right up!",
        "Yes.",
        "Sure. You got it. Great!",
        "Me, Fladermouse, great. I really—(motions to Joshua.)",
        "So? (She puts her hands in his, totally forgetting about the gloves, and hoping for something more intimate.)",
        "Ohh! Right! Right, sorry, I’ll be right back!",
        "Oh.",
        "No! Nothing!",
        "Yeah! That would be great!",
        "(shocked) Well, I-I guess—I…",
        "Yeah, great, you betcha!",
        "What?",
        "Oh. Oh, right.",
        "Oh yay!",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Hey, Monica!",
        "Ohh, it’s Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So… What are you gonna do?",
        "No! Help me!",
        "Phoebe?",
        "Ugh!",
        "Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is—I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y’know the \"Wouldn’t it be great if she was my wife\" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?",
        "Ohh! (Realises that Ross is in the room.) Hi!",
        "So….",
        "Ohhhh, come on!!!",
        "No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!",
        "I’ll be right there! (to Ross) Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we’ve gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?",
        "Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! (Monica opens the door.) Emily?",
        "I’m Rachel Green.",
        "There’s been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I’m not free tonight. So…",
        "Oh well, no I…",
        "I’ll get her.",
        "Hey—whoa, slow down. (Gets a whiff of him) No, keep moving. (Joey runs off.) Wow!",
        "Well, I didn’t see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face.",
        "The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.",
        "No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, \"I’m Rachel Greep! I’m Rachel Greep!\" and he let her right in.",
        "No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can’t believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.",
        "Honey, that’s you’re name.",
        "What? Who the hell is Emily—(realises) noooo!!",
        "They’re in Vermont!! How could this happen?! (She waves her arms franticly and hits Chandler.)",
        "How—how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?! (She hits Chandler again.)",
        "I don’t get this! She was horrible! (She hits Chandler, yet again.)",
        "I don’t care! All right, y’know what I’m just upset that I’m getting nowhere with Joshua that—y’know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!",
        "Oh, y’know, would you just for once, not remember every…little…thing!! (Storms out.)",
        "(joining them) Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn’t call. I mean you’d think he’d be worried about me not showing up at his club. Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!",
        "(entering) I can’t believe it! He still hasn’t called.",
        "It’s Joshua.",
        "No, I don’t.",
        "Yeah, come on! What’s going in on in there? (Pats his chest.)",
        "See, I don’t know, for me it would have to Chantal.",
        "Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh…",
        "Well, are we all together? Like in a group?",
        "Oh, hey!",
        "What?",
        "Oh, hmm.",
        "Joshua.",
        "Yeah, I…",
        "Oh, thank goodness!",
        "Oh, no problem. I’m so glad I could help. Happy for you. (She playfully punches him.)",
        "No, happy for you! (Hits him harder.)",
        "No-no-no, that’ not Joshua.",
        "Well you said *black*. Why would he want his blue blazer black?",
        "Don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?",
        "[nodding appreciatively] Nice, all right, yeah!",
        "Honey, this is really an incredible thing to do for them but there are things to think about.",
        "Wow, I don't know if I could ever do that. You know, I always figured the first time I had a baby, it would be with someone I love and that baby would be like, a keeper.",
        "Why don't you talk to someone who's had a baby. Like your mom.",
        "I am so jealous. You guys are just, really, right *there*, aren't you?",
        "Chandler, that is so nice.",
        "Why, just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, you should.",
        "Yeah, when we're in the audience, he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave.",
        "Yeah, not for girls anyway. Guys agree [snaps her fingers] like that.",
        "Let me see that. [looks at the drawing] Oh yeah.",
        "Well, you know, sometimes that helps.",
        "Well, if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Matterhorn.",
        "Oh, TOES!! [raises hands in air. They both look at her.] Yeah, for some people.",
        "[sadly] Oh.",
        "[looking away] Oh, I can't watch this. It's like \"Sophie's Choice.\"",
        "Oh, it was only okay.",
        "Depends who asked.",
        "Oh, Mon. Sure.",
        "Yes.",
        "You're not asking me, are you?",
        "Yes, totally.",
        "Chandler, there’s a guy right over there. (Points to the counter)",
        "Chandler, don’t worry! This doesn’t make you less of a guy! (Chandler starts blowing on his fingernails like women do.) That does! (Chandler stops blowing.) What am I sitting on? (She looks and finds a huge nail.) I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Well, here’s another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?",
        "Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?",
        "Guess who we ran into today?!",
        "You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.",
        "(entering, with Joey) Hey!",
        "Y’know, you-you also could’ve used uh, lamps and then followed the light.",
        "It’s coming from Joey!",
        "Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.",
        "(starts laughing, Ross stares at her) I’m sorry. I’m sorry. You’re right, you are a tough guy. You’re the toughest palaeontologist I know.",
        "Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin’ at him.",
        "You…are…not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?",
        "No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.",
        "(refers to the table) What are these?",
        "Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?",
        "Wow! If only more people knew.",
        "Hey!",
        "(noticing a bunch of pictures around the door that weren’t there originally.) What-what are-what are these?",
        "Oh my God! Look at this!",
        "I don’t care! The wires have come loose in your head!",
        "And did you?!",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.",
        "Thank God.",
        "What the hell is that?!! (to Monica) What the hell is that? Is that you? (Monica nods her head no, and Rachel realizes what is making that sound.) Ohhhhhhh! (storms over to Chandler and Joey’s with Monica in trail.)",
        "(angrily) BACK OFF!!! (She starts banging on their door.) Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!",
        "What is that noise?",
        "Well, I’ve been up since six. Thanks to somebody’s dumb-ass rooster.",
        "Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around…",
        "What?",
        "I’m so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.",
        "How many guesses do you get?",
        "No! There’s no orange juice in there! We win!!",
        "Okay, well, we won that one.",
        "Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.",
        "Fine! We’ll ask Phoebe.",
        "I know! I know, it’s such a huge, life-altering thing.",
        "Tails!",
        "We’ll take Literature!!",
        "Chandler gets it! It’s Chandler Bing!",
        "(shouting) It’s All Relative!!",
        "(shouting) I’m sorry!",
        "Monica, I don’t want to lose 200 dollars.",
        "Monica?!",
        "Okay, so let’s play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!",
        "Oooohh that’s interesting.",
        "Throw in the duck too!",
        "Well, he gets the other one all riled up.",
        "Monica, betting the apartment, I don’t know about this.",
        "Why? Do you have the answers written on there?",
        "All right, let’s do it.",
        "Okay. (They go into the living room.)",
        "All right!",
        "14?",
        "Space cowboy!",
        "Oh gosh, it has something to do with numbers.",
        "He carries a briefcase.",
        "Oh-oh-oh, he’s a transponce—transpondster!",
        "Oh my God.",
        "(entering from Chandler’s bedroom, I guess, and sees the foosball table.) Oh my God! I can’t believe you guys are actually think you’re moving in here!",
        "Well I-I-I’m not moving.",
        "No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!",
        "Noooo.",
        "What?!",
        "I don’t care, I’m not going anywhere.",
        "No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment and I like it! This is a girl’s apartment! That is a boy’s apartment, it’s dirty and it smells. This is pretty. It’s-it’s so pretty! And look, and it’s-it’s purple! And I’m telling you, you with the steady hand, I am not moving, and now I have got the steady hand. (She holds out her hand, which is shaking uncontrollably.)",
        "That’s right! You do what the hand says!",
        "How did it go?",
        "Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!",
        "That is not true. She did! She forced me!",
        "Well it stupid, unfair question!",
        "Will you stop calling it your apartment!",
        "No it’s not!",
        "Oh, I think I saw some in here.",
        "I don’t know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it’ll die.",
        "Bloomingdale’s eliminated my department. (Phoebe gasps)",
        "No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "(on the phone) Monica, I’m quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn’t even buy it! (Pause) I’m telling you I’m quitting! That’s it! I’m talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes I am! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. (Hangs up as her boss, Mr. Waltham, walks in.) Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you.",
        "Hi!",
        "Hi, I’m Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?",
        "Oh, I’m so sorry.",
        "Well, at least that’s a great suit.",
        "Okay.",
        "No-no, that wasn’t me! (To Joshua) Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. (Joshua turns at that) The selection of underwear we carry.",
        "Oh-oh, sorry, it’s this way, it’s this way. (Motions to the correct way.)",
        "I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!",
        "Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.",
        "Hi-e!!",
        "Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.",
        "It’s Joshua.",
        "Why? Honey, what is the big deal?",
        "Yeah, that’s true.",
        "Chandler, what did she say?",
        "Beefsteak Charlie’s?",
        "Whoops. (Starts to go into Chandler and Joey’s.) Oh, hey, do you need help with that?",
        "Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum. (She goes into Chandler and Joey’s.)",
        "Hi!",
        "So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It’s just so frustrating!",
        "Really? It doesn’t seem desperate?",
        "Hmm-mmm.",
        "Yeah but, I’ve never asked a guy out before.",
        "No. Have you?",
        "I don’t even know how I would go about it.",
        "You know what, I’m gonna do that, I’m gonna call him up, and I’m gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. (Practising) How you doin’? (Calls him) Hi! Joshua? It’s Rachel Green from Bloomingdale’s. (Listens) Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and we—(Listens) the license? Well, that is a good idea! Uh, well, let’s see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I’ll see you tomorrow. Bye. (Hangs up) (to Phoebe) You’ve done that a thousand times?",
        "Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.",
        "Really?! You think that will work?",
        "Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? (Tries again.) You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too… (Tries again.) Umm, who likes the Knicks—(Joshua comes in from the dressing room.)",
        "Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!",
        "Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. (She puts her arm in his and checks how they would look as a couple.) Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. (Pause) Umm, so you like it?",
        "Great.",
        "Sure.",
        "Yeah-eah-ha!",
        "Oh well, you don’t want to do that now?!",
        "Okay.",
        "Basketball!",
        "I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you’re interested, just as a thank you for this week.",
        "Really?",
        "I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.",
        "He didn’t turn me down! He’s at the game isn’t he? I got the date, I’m just not on it!",
        "Wow! Monica!",
        "Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.",
        "Really?",
        "Yes! I will! Absolutely! (She takes out his license and her license and holds them face to face with each other. She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in Spaceballs, and mimic a conversation between the two of them.) Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I’m glad. Rachel, I’d like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin’?",
        "Well, Joshua’s coming in tomorrow and since I don’t have the guts to ask him out, I’m going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.",
        "Oh, here’s that trench-coat that you wanted.",
        "Yeah?",
        "(stopping him) Oh no-no, no-no, they don’t want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.",
        "Well, that’s because of a lot of…(She imitates someone picking their nose and placing the treasure found in the pockets.)",
        "I know!",
        "Oh?",
        "Well, congratulations, so do you love her?",
        "Huh. Well, uh, that’s uh, that’s interesting. (She goes over and retrieves her note.)",
        "Oh, it’s just an anti-theft device.",
        "You need that, you need that too ‘cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up. (Rips up the note.)",
        "Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.",
        "We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it’s actually for Joshua. (Starts handing out party hats.) Look, he said he’s not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him! (Hands Ross a party hat.)",
        "Surprise!!!",
        "Well, it was all Ross’s idea.",
        "Uhh, because I’m trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he’s looking over here, say something funny.",
        "Okay, y’know what, y’know what? This playing hard to get thing is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. (Chandler does so.) Okay. Okay. (She does a little sexy walk over to where Joshua is standing.) Hi!",
        "Care for a cherry?",
        "No? Y’know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.",
        "Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?",
        "Up!",
        "Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.",
        "Ohh, God! Look at him, he’s so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?",
        "What?",
        "It’s not Christmas!",
        "He’s not 11!",
        "What? You’re leaving?!",
        "No! You guys can’t leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!",
        "(spinning the bottle) So, Spin the Bottle works like this: I spin the bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. (She crawls over to where Gunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on Gunther’s face and decides not to kiss him.) All right. Who wants to go first?",
        "Yay! Emily!",
        "Okay, my turn!!",
        "It’s okay! It’s okay! It kicked once, it’ll kick again!",
        "All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.",
        "Just a bug.",
        "No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn’t working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.",
        "Hi!",
        "Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye cheer. So okay! (Runs into the living room) Ready! Okay! Gimme an ‘E!’",
        "Gimme an ‘M!’",
        "Gimme an ‘I!’",
        "Gimme an ‘L!’",
        "Gimme a ‘Y!’",
        "What do you get? (She throws her pom-poms to Joey and Phoebe and performs a cartwheel.) Emily!! (Tries to do another one.) Emil—Whoa!! (She falls in Chandler’s room.) Okay! So that’s me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum! (Gunther’s the only one that claps.)",
        "I’m fine! I’m fine! I’m just losing a tooth, it’s no big deal. I have a dentist! Y’know. I’m gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. (She goes over to the ice and Joey and Monica follow her.) What do I do now? What do I do now?",
        "All right, come on, let’s go get your coat.",
        "Oh, yeah! Real fun. (She makes a decision.) Y’know, this bra… Really, bothers me. (She starts taking off her bra.) Y’know, this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could talk, y’know what they’d say? Wanna hear some memories? (She is now violently pulling on her bra in order to remove it, but it isn’t co-operating.)",
        "Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.",
        "Ughhhh!! Forget it! (Sits down heavily on the bed.) This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.",
        "Can you not look at me when I say this? (He turns around) I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.",
        "Well, I’m sorry, I thought you needed them!",
        "Why?!",
        "You like me?",
        "Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can’t believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!",
        "Oh no-no-no don’t say but! No-no, but’s never good! Let’s just leave it at, you like me and I like you.",
        "Oh, now see that’s a fancy but.",
        "But….",
        "Okay.",
        "Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua’s gone so you and Emily are free to go.",
        "Oh, Ross, I’m sorry. I completely ruined your evening.",
        "Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.",
        "Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?",
        "I’m so sorry.",
        "Well, maybe you didn’t want it to end?",
        "You seem to really like her.",
        "Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.",
        "Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I don’t know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.",
        "Hey.",
        "You’re a pathetic loser, right?",
        "Sit!",
        "Oh my gosh, Joshua!",
        "They’re not true?",
        "Oh.",
        "Oh! Oh, I love that but.",
        "You wanna go inside and have some coffee?",
        "Okay. (Joshua goes inside and to Chandler.) Every time."

        "Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal. (Ross gives her this look, like 'Yeah, doesn't it', and gets up to dump it down the drain.)",

        "Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that.",

        "So, what happens to the old guys?",
        "Why, do I have a feeling that’s not as happy as it sounds? (Joey points out one going into the chipper to her, as this haunty, demonic music starts to play in the background) No! Nooooo!!! (she winces in horror and hides her face against Joey’s shoulder, as she sees the tree spit out from the chipper.)",
        "(running up carrying a tree) Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you don’t want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one. (points to the almost dead tree she has)",
        "Okay but that’s why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it’s Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey",
        "Well look no further, (shows her the dead one) this one’s yours! Ahhh.",
        "All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one! I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to get so emotional, I guess it’s just the holidays, it’s hard.",
        "Oh, I wasn’t even thinking about that.",
        "This is the worst Christmas ever.",
        "Oh! Oh my God!",
        "You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you’re the best!",
        "Oh, God bless us, everyone.",
        "Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.",
        "Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. (just as she sits down).",
        "Oh, can I play too? I’ve never played football, like ever.",
        "Yay!!",
        "Okay, so how do we decide that?",
        "Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle.",
        "Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?",
        "Yeah.",
        "What’s block?",
        "I thought you meant in life.",

        "Touchdown!! Touchdown!!",
        "Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?",

        "Woo-yay!!",
        "I love this game!!",
        "Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!",
        "All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?",
        "Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.",
        "Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.",
        "Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn’t the play still going.",
        "Isn’t there a national football league.",
        "Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?",
        "(entering, with about 20 purses hanging around her neck) Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses!",
        "Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.",
        "Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it.",
        "A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich�. Why don't you get a magician?!",
        "Well, can you dance at all?",
        "(covering her mouth in shock) What, what is that?",
        "Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita?",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!",
        "What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, (reading) 'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!",

        "(entering) Hey!",
        "What are you wrapping?",
        "Yeah, it's a vase.",
        "Well not exactly like the one in the poem.",

        "Oh, oh! It's on again!",
        "Hey.",
        "Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! (they all stare at her) Okay,\n        it was me! ",
        "Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean,\n        Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7\n        and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell\n        you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it. (shows\n        him her hand)",
        "Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.",

        "No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. (on the phone in a different\n        voice) 'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um,\n        is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'",
        "(on phone) 'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey\n        Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak\n        to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to\n        do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns\n        down the apartment, the world does not stop.'",
        "(on phone) 'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition,\n        that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll,\n        what time can you see him?' (to Monica) I need a pen. (Chandler\n        hands her one, but she needs something to right on, so she\n        tilts Chandler's head over and writes on the back of his neck)",
        "Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone\n        again?",
        "(on phone, in 'Katelynn's' voice) 'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay\n        returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have\n        to patch you through.'",
        "(in voice, on phone) 'Okay, go ahead.' (in normal voice on\n        phone) Um, hi Annie. (listens) Fantastic! (to Joey) You got\n        it. (on phone) Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work for scale?' you ask\n        me. Well, I don't know about that, (Joey clears his throat to\n        signify yes) except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are\n        such a sweetheart. I would love to have lunch with you, how\n        about we have lunch next....(hangs up phone) Op, went through\n        a tunnel.",
        "It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone\n        before.",
        "Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.",
        "Two?",
        "Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right",
        "(entering) Helloo! Oh! (sees Joey and starts to leave)",
        "No it's not, sorry.",
        "Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in\n        those....pants.",
        "Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't\n        get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",
        "But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a\n        terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the\n        person who makes your face look like that.",
        "Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry\n        I quit, okay, I just quit.",
        "Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an\n        Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.",
        "Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this\n        job! I...",
        "Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.",
        "Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to\n        work on. ",
        "Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.",
        "No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So,\n        you can work on that. ",
        "Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but\n        dumb'.",
        "Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'",
        "Oh.",
        "Yeah, no, I understand.",
        "Yeah. Sorry. (she starts to leave)",
        "What?",
        "(in a coy tone) Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.",
        "No, no, it’s just my tooth.",
        "No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can’t see him.",
        "Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.",
        "Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there\n        was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend\n        ‘Albino Bob’.",
        "Yes, while I was in the chair! That’s why I take such good\n        care of my teeth now, y'know, it’s not about oral hygiene, I\n        floss to save lives!",
        "Well tell that to them. Oh! You can’t, their dead.",
        "(trying to bite into an apple) Ow! Ow! (drops the apple in\n        disgust.)",
        "All right, fine, fine, but if you’re my next victim, don’t come\n        back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.",
        "Although, don’t feel like you can’t visit.",
        "Well, you could wait ‘til I go to the dentist, maybe I’ll kill\n        him.",
        "Well, I’m going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the\n        look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or,\n        or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay,\n        And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that\n        um...... (starts to cry and runs out)",
        "(running through the door) No! Oh! You’re alive! You’re\n        alive!",
        "Yeah, well, we’ll see about that. Can I use your phone? I\n        just wanna call everyone I know.",
        "(on phone) ‘Hey! You’re not dead! Okay, see ya!’",
        "(rushing in) Okay. If you’re alive you answer your phone!",
        "Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I\n        know, and everyone is alive.",
        "What?",
        "Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this\n        curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.",
        "I’m telling you he’s dead. What we are about to have here\n        is a dead fat guy on a stick.",
        "He’s alive! He’s a-live!!!",
        "(joining him) ‘Love....’",
        "‘I’ll be a fool for you. I’m sure, you know I\n                     don’t mind.’",
        "‘Yes! You mean the world the world to me.\n                     Oh..’",
        "‘I know.’",
        "‘I’ve found....’",
        "‘...in you, my endless (Phoebe goes high\n                     pitched, Chandler goes low pitched) love.’ (they\n                     both look at each other.) ‘My endless love.’ (once\n                     again they don’t match tones, and they just look\n                     at each other)",
        "Why don’t you go up there and ask him to ‘step lightly, please?’",
        "Ooh, that is silly. (gets up) I’ll go up there, I’ll tell him to keep it down.",
        "(muffled through the floor) Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... (I tired but the rest is unintelligible).",
        "(muffled) Oh, thank you.",
        "Well, he’s very charming.",
        "Well, you’re just gonna have to try.",
        "(to one of his sisters, Cookie) Hey!",
        "Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice.",
        "Wow. Okay, I don’t know how to talk to you.",
        "Where’d you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.",
        "Why, what happened?",
        "How can you not know which one?",
        "We didn’t fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!",
        "Oh well y'know. (laughs)",
        "Ick, you were eavesdropping.",
        "Oh, I’m sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me.",
        "Thanks you guys! Thank you.",
        "God, I hope they kick his ass!",
        "Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.",
        "(to Chandler) Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?",
        "Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she’s done.",
        "Oh no, one of those ‘look for the hidden meaning’ songs.",
        "Hey Leslie, how’d you know I’d be here?",
        "Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.",
        "Hmm, bummer.",
        "No. But thanks.",
        "Okay. No. But thanks.",
        "Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y’know. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. (to Monica) Can I have a tissue, please?",
        "Where’s Chandler?",
        "Oh. (takes her beeper puts in a pot, covers it, and puts the pot in the oven)",
        "Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. That’s the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!",
        "Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together.",
        "You never run on a barge!",
        "Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!",
        "It’s just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn’t called. Not that I even care, y'know.",
        "You think you know me so well.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That’s what I said.",
        "I can’t. I can’t. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was ‘Okay, bye Pheebs’ gone. Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I’ve ever had in like all my lives.",
        "(singing) I stepped in something icky.",
        "(singing) Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, it’s not your fault.",
        "Oh, yeah!",
        "I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.",
        "Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I’d be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.",
        "That’s okay. All right, I’m gonna play song that’s really, really sad. It’s called Magician Box Mix Up. (she turns her guitar upside down to play it.)",
        "(to Leslie) Oh, I thought you weren’t coming. What? Where were you?",
        "Okay, don’t give me a reason to get mad, okay",
        "No, look, I told you that I didn’t want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would’ve done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can’t trust you then just forget it.",
        "Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won’t be partners. So what’s it gonna be?",
        "Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life’s gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song?",
        "Okay. (singing) ‘Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.’ That’s all I have so far.",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?",
        "Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.",
        "The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.",
        "Now what is Fabutec?",
        "Waxine!!",
        "Oh, it’s incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.",
        "God. Do think it really doesn’t hurt? ‘Cause how can they do that?",
        "They have the best stuff in there.",
        "(reading from the instructions) After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,",
        "Grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.",
        "Was it not pain-free?",
        "Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’t seem to think it’s that bad.",
        "(Removing one of the strips) Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!",
        "Oh!!",
        "Ow!!!",
        "Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!",
        "We’re all right.",
        "We’re all right.",
        "For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.",
        "Oh yeah, come here. (Puts a little wax on Joey’s arm and puts a strip on it.)",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "(to Joey) What, what are they talking about?",
        "Whe-where did he put it?!",
        "Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.",
        "Should we do something?",
        "Hi, it’s Phoebe. Listen someone’s gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, ‘cause it’s like 9:15 now, and I’m not there.",
        "We could eat the wax! It’s organic.",
        "No, not the used wax.",
        "They’re gonna get through this, aren’t they?",
        "Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.",
        "They’ve been quiet for a long time.",
        "Oh come on, they can be in the same room.",
        "Why? What happened now?",
        "Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He’s the one who slept with someone else.",
        "Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you’re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.",
        "Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....",
        "Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.",
        "(turning around and picking a cup off of a table) Oh, hey, look, I found coffee! (handing her the cup) Okay, let’s skedaddle.",
        "Okay, your highness.",
        "(in a deep voice, imitating Ross) Um, Rachel I’m really sorry. (imitating Rachel) That’s okay, do you wanna get back together? (imitating Ross) Yeah, okay. (in her normal voice) Did anyone else hear that?!",
        "Hey!",
        "No, it’s just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.",
        "Ohhh boy, do I feel bad.",
        "Chandler what are you doing?!",
        "Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?",
        "Him? Him, Ross?",
        "Wait. Really?! ‘Cause mine get me out of tickets.",
        "Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel’s sister’s cabin. (Chandler goes back to the window to smoke again.)",
        "Y'know what, I can stay, I’m gonna stay. ‘Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.",
        "Chandler!!",
        "What does the sign say?",
        "No, the ‘No Smoking’ sign. There’s no smoking in my Grandmother’s cab.",
        "Please!",
        "(to Rachel, who’s staying in the cab.) Aren’t you gonna go?",
        "No, y'know what don’t close it (Rachel slams the door shut locking themselves out.) ‘cause the... keys...are in there.",
        "Okay, Monica’s are the biggest.",
        "All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.",
        "(finishing removing her bra) Okay, there.",
        "Okay. (The car moves a few feet and sputters to a stop.) Oh, no!",
        "Yeah, this has happened before.",
        "Yep. Put more gas in.",
        "Okay, yeah. (to Monica and Rachel) Triple A can pick us up.",
        "Yeah, what town are we near?",
        "(to Monica) Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we’re on?",
        "Okay. (on phone) We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. (to Rachel) There is no Route 27. (listens) (to Rachel) Okay, either 93 or 76?",
        "Okay. (on phone) Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? (listens) Okay! (hangs up) Yeah, no they don’t do that.",
        "But if...",
        "Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.",
        "(answering the phone) (whispering) Ross, thank God.",
        "I ate a bug.",
        "Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don’t know where we are, so we can’t get a tow truck.",
        "Yes, please.",
        "Oh, it’s Ross on one of his drives!",
        "Hi!",
        "(to Chandler and Monica) You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we’re then gonna go skiing?",
        "Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.",
        "Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! (they all stop fighting, Chandler continues to dance.) Look what you’re doing to Chandler!! (Chandler finally stops) (to Ross and Rachel) Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? (Ross starts to leave) You don’t, all right you don’t have to love each other, okay? You don’t, you don’t even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.",
        "Yeah, otherwise, I mean that’s, that’s, that’s just it for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? (they both look away) Can you be civil?",
        "Okay. Good, all right, let’s get back in the car, ‘cause it’s freezing, and my chest is unsupported.",
        "Maybe we can like go to a movie or something.",
        "Or, or the rodeo!!",
        "Okay!",
        "Bye!!!",
        "(entering, holding a pair of Roller Blades) Hi.",
        "Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that’s he’s going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff.",
        "I’m going to let him.",
        "Oh, there’s no such thing as an innocent burger.",
        "Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.",
        "(to Robert) You’ve have lipstick right here (points to her cheek). That’s okay, it’s mine, we just kissed.",
        "I’ll have coffee.",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.",
        "Oh, I get more because I’m dainty.",
        "Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter?",
        "What? (the guys keep laughing.) What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert? (the guys keep laughing.) Why are you laughing?!",
        "You guys!! Come on!",
        "What do you mean?",
        "Hey.",
        "Hey. Ooh! Don’t sit down!",
        "Yeah. And, first here’s a gift.",
        "That’s all right, that’s well, I figured.... (they start to leave as Joey enters.)",
        "Listen, Robert’s gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?",
        "Please, right now, no, every time I see him it’s like ‘Is it on the lose?’ ‘Is it watching me?’",
        "Hey.",
        "No, I can spot you from here.",
        "Okay, listen Robert...",
        "Umm, I think you’re really, really great...",
        "I-I-I-I-I don’t know, I don’t know what to say.",
        "All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.",
        "Oh my God!!",
        "Frank! Hi!",
        "What are you doing here?",
        "What happened?",
        "But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?",
        "Your getting married?!",
        "My little brother’s getting married!!",
        "Do I?",
        "Yeah, I do, yeah.",
        "Yeah, isn’t it fantastic?",
        "What, he’s 18.",
        "Yeah, I’m a big surprise.",
        "Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you’re ready for that?",
        "Oh good! Okay. ‘Cause you were acting like you didn’t.",
        "No, I know, I know, that this is Frank’s life, (walks behind them, they turn around in the leather chairs to face her) y'know. Y'know, I don’t want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it’s sick and wrong!",
        "No-no, oh, I’m fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it’s tongue down my little brother’s throat!",
        "But, I mean, do you think he’s gonna enjoy it when he’s up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank, (she walks behind them again, and hey again turn to follow her) and it-it’s not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it’s not good home economics.",
        "Yes. Not out loud.",
        "Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he’s gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can’t. (pause) But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.",
        "Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!",
        "Okay, I’m gonna go get Frank. (exits)",
        "(to Joey) You’re Frank’s best man?!",
        "Well then, (to Ross) what about you?! Huh?!",
        "Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I’m so glad you could come, ‘cause I’ve got a real umm, Home Ec emergency. (Points to the table cloth, which has a huge mustard stain on it.)",
        "Yeah, I know. It’s a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?",
        "Y'know what, forget it. It’s ruined.",
        "Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.",
        "Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?",
        "Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?",
        "What umm, what happened?",
        "Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?",
        "Yeah, yeah, no, I don’t, I don’t know. But, y'know what, maybe it’s just all for the best?",
        "Oh, sweetie, oh. (hugs him)",
        "Uh, well I can tell you why. It’s, it’s because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?",
        "Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn’t be together, y'know. And you’re gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay, but.",
        "Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn’t. There’s someone here who can explain this better than I can.",
        "Yeah, but not just that.",
        "None the less.",
        "That’s right, exactly. (sees them) All right, it’s a good bye kiss, that’s good. (Frank picks Alice up and they move to the couch) Bye-bye. (They both lie down on the couch and start to make out.) Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I’m saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. (They ignore her) Okay, I’ve decided I’m gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? (She reaches in and Alice moans) Okay, all right, good. (leaves).",
        "(entering) Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas!",
        "I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages outside the UN and, I don’t know where his country is.",
        "Oh!! That’s my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace.",
        "Ick-neck-tree-anis..... There’s a ‘g’ in there.",
        "In your atlas!",
        "Oh.",
        "Oh.",
        "Umm, well he’s very dashing, y'know, and umm, very, very sophisticated, and he doesn’t speak any English, but according to his translator, he totally gets me.",
        "What is this?",
        "Me too. Although this city is my home, so. So that’s dumb what I said, don’t tell him I said that. Umm, you make something up. (Mischa does so and Sergei kisses her hand.) Nice, (to Mischa) thank you. This is me. Here.",
        "(to Mischa) Thank you, very much! Oh! (to Sergei) Thank you!",
        "(to Mischa) Okay, y'know what, you don’t have to do that now. (Mischa translates that to Sergei) No-no-no-no!! Not him, you don’t! (Mischa tells Sergei he can proceed and steps away) Well the moment’s over.",
        "Oh.",
        "(pointing to the globe) See there it is right there.",
        "Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.",
        "Yeah. Except for, y'know when you’re on a date and you’re getting along really great but the guy’s translator keeps getting in the way.",
        "(to Monica) Anyway, I’m going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator’s date? So that when we, it’s time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he’s really, he’s kinda cute.",
        "Hey, don’t call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!",
        "(laughing and banging her spoon on the table) Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.",
        "You didn’t say Boutros Boutros Gali.",
        "Interesting.",
        "Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.",
        "Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. (Behind the menu) What are you doing?",
        "Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven’t been able to say two words to each other.",
        "That would be great. Thank you.",
        "Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don’t accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it.",
        "Well, tell him, apology accepted.",
        "Excuse me, but umm, isn’t he paying for your dinner?",
        "Plate! Yes, plate.",
        "See, we don’t need them.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Ameri-can.",
        "Ameri-can. Y'know it’s a very hard language. Let’s do it again.",
        "We were out of Doritos.",
        "Oh.",
        "Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.",
        "What, so what are you gonna tell him?",
        "Huh.",
        "Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you’re not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.",
        "Okay, so it’s probably just the Ross thing then.",
        "So, you’re like a zillionaire? (Pete smiles and nods)",
        "Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.",
        "Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.",
        "Yeah, kinda.",
        "(to Chandler) Hey! (Chandler looks up, startled) Why isn’t it Spiderman? Y’know like Goldman, Silverman...",
        "It isn’t?",
        "Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!",
        "Okay well, he would turn things to gold.",
        "Ahh, his work is done.",
        "Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!! (they both kick up the foot rests like an old fashioned gun fight.)",
        "Oh, it’s so great to see you feeling like this!",
        "Wait, am I missing something though? ‘Cause I thought death was something that’s supposed to be sad, in a way.",
        "Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.",
        "No, just a barrel.",
        "Really?! Really?!",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It’s so beautiful.",
        "So, I’m here, ready to play.",
        "I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha. (She removes this large ceramic dog that comes up to the second floor and places it next to the house.)",
        "That’s a dog, every house should have a dog.",
        "Well, maybe it’s so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.",
        "No, no, that’s the ghost for the attic.",
        "Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you’ve got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.",
        "Okay, obviously you don’t know much about the U.S. government.",
        "(holding a dinosaur) Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! (the dinosaur starts attacking the house. She starts to bark like a dog.) Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!",
        "Okay, (starts to pack up her stuff) fine. Come dinosaur, we’re not welcome in the house of no imagination.",
        "The little ones do.",
        "Hey!",
        "Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!",
        "Look, look! (She lifts up the roof, and the front panel falls revealing the interior.)",
        "Oh, okay, it’s the slide instead of stairs. Watch this. (She slides a doll down the slide)",
        "The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.",
        "Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room? (lights some incense)",
        "Watch, watch. (She turns a strand of Christmas lights strung around the house.)",
        "And, and! (She turns on a bubble maker.)",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "What?! Oh my... (sees the remains of the house) Oh my God!! What happened?!",
        "All right. Did everyone get out okay?",
        "Ohh. What is this? (She sees a tissue covering something, and moves to remove it.)",
        "(She pauses to ready herself, and removes the tissue.) Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!",
        "Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he’s at Flimby’s.",
        "Oh, yeah, that’s the word I use when I can’t remember the real thing.",
        "No! Rachel, that’s what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow, if I don’t get through, they’re not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! It’s us versus them!",
        "Like a date type (looks at Rachel) person?",
        "Thanks!",
        "Okay. (on phone) Ooh, I’m setting the phone down. (does so) But I’m still here! Just don’t go anywhere I’m still here. (starts to put on the sweater) Don’t-don’t switch or anything, ‘cause I’m, I’m right here. (She has pulled the sweater over her head, but her head is stuck in a sleeve.) Just one sec. One sec! One second!! (She is now frantically trying to get the sweater on, as Monica returns from the bathroom.) Wait! One second! Just…",
        "What?! Monica, I’m scared!!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yes!! Yes!! I’m the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.",
        "No.",
        "Oh, is the play over?",
        "Nah. I kept myself busy.",
        "Oh, okay, yeah. (to Monica) I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff in your room.",
        "No, no, I’m fine, and y’know why? ‘Cause of all the riboflavin.",
        "I’m so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see you’re play. I swear you’re play is very important to us, thank you for your patience. You’re play is the next play is the next play I’m gonna see.",
        "Oh, I… (starts jabbering incoherently)",
        "I do, I believe you.",
        "Yeah. But I also believed her (points to the phone) when she said I was next.",
        "Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it’s one of those 801 numbers. Right?",
        "No, no, no, oh no-no-no, it’s has to be 800. (picks up the instruction manual to check the phone number) ‘Cause all those big companies have 800 numbers, every one. (Finds the number) Yeah, every big Utah-based company has one.",
        "Sorry, I’m so sorry, I will pay you back.",
        "Fine! Fine! (slams the phone down, breaking it) Oh-oh!",
        "Well, I think I broke it. But that’s all right, here’s the number you can call.",
        "Oh my God, they took my idea!",
        "Yeah! Okay, here you go. (rolls her back to Rachel)",
        "Oh my God, are you guys okay?",
        "Umm, oh, about three months.",
        "Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?",
        "Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this\n        age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right\n        food, and lot’s and lot’s of love.",
        "(to Pete) Wow! That’s exciting, you went to Japan, made up a\n        woman.",
        "I’m just saying, this woman, I mean she’s fictitious. No?",
        "‘Cause you’re still into Monica. So you told her there was\n        somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so ‘cause\n        you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe\n        something might happen, and...",
        "Yeah, no, I’m fairly intuitive and psychic. It’s a substantial\n        gift.",
        "Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?",
        "No I’m serious. I mean I’m intuitive, but my memory sucks.",
        "Hey! ",
        "What?",
        "Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.",
        "Ooh, I have to tell you something.",
        "But I can’t tell you.",
        "Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn’t\n        tell, and I swore to like all my gods.",
        "No.",
        "No.",
        "No, but let’s come back to that later!",
        "Noo!",
        "Oh, wait, wait. Clogs, or claws?",
        "No.",
        "No.",
        "(Shaking her head yes) No!",
        "I don’t know! (frantically points at Monica)",
        "I can’t!!",
        "I, but you’re so close! No!",
        "Oh, just go. You’re never gonna get it!",
        "(to her date) Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music. (points to the stage)",
        "Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people.",
        "Vince is a fireman.",
        "Okay. (watches him leave)",
        "Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.",
        "I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.",
        "Does a dog's lips move when he reads? (Joey makes an `I don't know' face, and looks to Chandler and Rachel, who're also stumped) Okay, no they don't.",
        "That is so great! Oh, I... (sees that a parked car near them has caught on fire) Oh my God!",
        "(the fire has worsened) Oh my God!!!",
        "(stopping him) No! No!",
        "Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic. (hears the sound of approaching sirens) Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out of here!",
        "Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay? (she drags him away)",
        "(entering with Rachel) …and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.",
        "(disgusted) Uh.",
        "Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field.",
        "Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's so burly, he's sooo very burly. (giggles)",
        "Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Jason is not a sissy!",
        "God, that is the nicest kitchen.",
        "No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day.",
        "All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.",
        "Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it’s just Jason’s so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it’s just better than having just like a really, really, really nice (pause) butt. (Her eyes glaze over thinking about the butt.) (pause) Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!",
        "Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?",
        "Wow! I didn’t know you guys actually used those.",
        "Umm, wow. This-this isn’t gonna be easy. Umm, I don’t think we should see each other anymore.",
        "I’m sorry.",
        "Oh my God, I didn’t…",
        "(running after him) Wait-wait-wait! Wait!!",
        "(to Ross) I’m telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.",
        "(gasps) Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. (They both look at her.) Like for clubbing.",
        "Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?",
        "No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he’s incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.",
        "Yeah, well he’d prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.",
        "Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and… Okay so Jason is sensitive, (holds up one finger) but now so’s Vince (holds up one finger on her other hand) Plus, Vince has the body y'know? (holds up two more fingers on the Vince side) So… It’s really just about the math.",
        "(knocks on the door) Jason?",
        "Nah-ha!",
        "(singing) “Crazy underwear, creepin’ up my butt. (Jason enters) Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under-(sees Jason)-wear…” (In her head) Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep playing. You’ll get through this; you’ll be fine. (She tries to continue the song, but she has lost the ability to pronounce words, and the lyrics come out as gibberish.) (giving up on the song) Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show.",
        "Hey!",
        "I don’t know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!",
        "Yeah, okay, I’ve-I’ve been dating both of you, and it’s been really horrible. ‘Cause y'know it’s been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I like you both, and I, and I didn’t know how to chose, so... I’m sorry, I’m just, I’m terrible, I’m a terrible person. I’m terrible.",
        "Really?!",
        "Well, this is none of my business. (starts to walk away)",
        "Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park.",
        "(to Vince) Well, that could’ve been really awkward.",
        "Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I’m gonna do that for you.",
        "Ehh?",
        "I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!",
        "How close?",
        "I don’t even know how that would work!",
        "(interrupting) I’m not asking!",
        "Yeah. Let’s see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.",
        "Yeah, well, everybody does! I’m a really cool person. And y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn’t even try! Y'know what, you walked out on me, and I’m just, I’m gonna do the same thing to you.",
        "I don’t ever want to see you again! ",
        "(walking back in with her hand over her eyes.) Umm, where’s my purse?",
        "Well, umm, my Mom’s friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.",
        "Oh, my new Mom, who-who’s a big, fat abandoner! (starts to go upstairs)",
        "No. I’m just, I wanna, I need to be alone.",
        "(turning around, insistently) Monica!",
        "Well, I’m ready to get the hell out of here! (Sees Ross and Rachel cuddling on the couch.) Oh. Are you? Are you?!! (they nod ‘Yes.’) Ohh! That’s so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. (they nod ‘No.’) But for you, yay! Ohh.",
        "Okay, I’m gonna put this (her suitcase) in the car.",
        "(to the person that answered the door) Hi, Ursula.",
        "Okay, well umm, I know that we haven’t talked in a long time, but umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.",
        "(shocked) You know her?!",
        "There-there was a suicide note?! (Ursula nods ‘Yes.’) Well, do you still have it?",
        "I can’t believe you didn’t tell me there was a suicide note!",
        "I, umm, shut up!",
        "(reading from the note) “Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I’ll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk.” You just wrote this!",
        "Noooo!!",
        "No. I’m-I’m to depressed to talk.",
        "(singing) “...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm.” (applause) Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. (Sees that Phoebe Sr. has entered, and to her) Except for you. You go away.",
        "Okay, bye.",
        "No.",
        "But, it’s not like we’re losing anything. Y'know?",
        "It’s not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common.",
        "I-I like pizza!",
        "Oh my God, so do I!",
        "Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?",
        "Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I’m-I’m mad at you.",
        "Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I’m kinda hungry.",
        "All right, stop it. Now you’re just doing it to freak me out.",
        "(screaming, angrily) ...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!! (applause) (happily) Thank you, thanks.",
        "Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?",
        "Yeah, I actually don’t know...",
        "Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on, you! (goes over and picks up the cat) Come on. Crazy. (looks into the cat’s eyes) Oh my God.",
        "Nothing. Nothing.",
        "I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.",
        "No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.",
        "No Dr. Skeptismo! I’m sure. First of all, okay, there’s the feeling. (Chandler shrugs) Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. (Rachel nods her head in unsure agreement) My Mother’s favourite fish is Orange Roughy... (Joey thinks he understands, but then nods that he has no clue.) Cats....like....fish! (Ross and Rachel are totally lost) (to the cat) Hi, Mommy. (Rachel covers her mouth, in an “Oh my God.” gesture) Oh, I haven’t seen this smile in 17 years!",
        "(is struggling with the cat) Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.",
        "Well, I’m not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there’s y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she’s worried that y'know, she’s gonna, she’s gonna be replaced. (to the cat, in a funny voice) Well, that’s not gonna happen is it? Noo. (gets up) Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.",
        "Well, I’m returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word. (goes into Monica’s room)",
        "(entering, with Julio) Hi. (sits down in the chair)",
        "Yeah?",
        "So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.",
        "I just feel so, uhh.....",
        "Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo.",
        "Yeah? (sees Ross) Hi!",
        "Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?",
        "(she turns around and puts the cat on the entertainment center) Ross, how many parents have you lost?",
        "Okay, then you don’t know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I’m wrong, who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive.",
        "Okay.",
        "I think she would like that.",
        "Thank you. We both forgive you.",
        "Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you’re welcome to come back anytime.",
        "Come on, Mom, I’ll take you home.",
        "All right, so, so you went to Pete’s...",
        "So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?",
        "No-no-no oh, keep your name, don’t take his name.",
        "Well then definately don’t take his name.",
        "(intrigued) Oh?!",
        "(disappointed) Oh.",
        "Yeesh, what’d you do about it?",
        "Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?",
        "Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?",
        "Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren’t together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you’re not cool with it...",
        "You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She’s yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...",
        "Great! Okay, good for you! (as they leave she slaps Rachel on the butt)",
        "Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie. (who has hair by the way)",
        "(to Bonnie) Well I hope you have fun tonight.",
        "Yeah, she was bald, she’s not now.",
        "I don’t know, I hardly ever say that about people.",
        "Well I’m sorry, I thought you said it was okay.",
        "Well, maybe it won’t work out. Maybe Ross won’t like her personality.",
        "Oh no, Bonnie’s the best!",
        "So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?",
        "Ohh, that’s too bad!",
        "Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.",
        "Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?",
        "Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?",
        "No! No! Look at that! (drags her away from the window) It’s a line of ants! They’re working as a team!",
        "(looking in the window) Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let’s go.",
        "Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.",
        "You said it was okay!",
        "What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!",
        "Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don’t get it. Aren’t you the one that decided that you didn’t want to be with Ross?",
        "Well isn’t he your friend? Don’t you want him to be happy?",
        "So?",
        "(sits down next to her and hugs her) Oh no.",
        "Oh, we killed them all.",
        "Wait, if that’s his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?",
        "(entering, hurridly) Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look\n        at this! (She hands Chandler a picture) That’s my Mom’s\n        writing! Look.",
        "Y'know what that means?",
        "No-no, that’s not, that’s not me Phoebe, that’s her pal\n        Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like\n        B.F.F. (Ross and Bonnie look at her quizzically) Best Friends\n        Forever.",
        "I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of\n        stories about my parents, and she might even know like where\n        my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach.\n        So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?",
        "So great! Okay! Tomorrow we’re gonna drive out to Montauk.",
        "Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this\n        woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy\n        back gives me his beach house.",
        "Oh, I wasn’t talking about his karma.",
        "And this time, they’ve ganged up to form one giant, super hat.",
        "Oy!!",
        "Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.",
        "(at the door) Knock, knock, knock.",
        "(entering) Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?",
        "Hi Phoebe Abott, I’m your best friends daughter!",
        "No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here. (hands her the\n        picture) Lily, from high school. Remember?",
        "(points to herself) Phoebe. (points to her) Phoebe. Phoebe,\n        yeah. She named me after you I guess.",
        "Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That’s my Dad, that’s Frank! Yeah! I’m\n        sorry I’m getting all flingy.",
        "No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks. ",
        "(goes and gets some cookies) Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I’ve\n        been, I’ve been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard\n        from him, or seen him?",
        "(disappointed) Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my\n        parents. Everything.",
        "Oh, what? What was it?",
        "(happily) Yeah, no, it was great.",
        "(entering) Oh, hey!",
        "Oh, so, how are we doing?",
        "I’m kind, caring, and sweet. What’s Monica like?",
        "Ohh, I think she knows where my Dad is.",
        "She was acting, she was pretending like she hasn’t heard from\n        him on years, but I found this picture on her fridge, and look\n        (shows Monica)! Isn’t this what he would look like now?",
        "I don’t know, but we’re having dinner tomorrow night, so I\n        figured, she’s gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just\n        wanted to give him time to, buy me presents, I don’t know! So,\n        you’re all bored?",
        "All right, I’m gonna close my eyes and point to someone, and\n        you, whoever I point has to come up with something fun for us\n        to do, and we have to do it. ",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay. (Starts to spin) Ooh, y'know we could just do this. (She\n        stops at Chandler)",
        "Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody\n        take off one item of clothing. It hasn’t happened yet, but\n        we’re all very excited.",
        "Come on, take ‘em off!!",
        "Shhh! Shhhh! Joey’s asleep.",
        "After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him\n        warm.",
        "She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!",
        "Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. She’s\n        avoiding me, she doesn’t want to tell me where my Father is.\n        She knows, and she won’t tell me.",
        "Yeah, well, don’t \"Aww Pheebs, that sucks!\" me yet. (she starts\n        to leave)",
        "Well, she’s out of town so, there’s gotta be something in her\n        house that tells me where my Father is.",
        "Well, are any of those people here?!",
        "Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? I’ll-I’ll fill her\n        ice trays.",
        "Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. (She manages to climb completely\n        inside and the window slams shut.) Oh, shhh!",
        "No! No!! It’s me! It’s me! I-I didn’t want to make any noise!",
        "I’m sorry.",
        "I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.",
        "Umm, okay, okay, look. I took this picture from your fridge.\n        Okay, because I know that this is my Father. Yeah, this is\n        Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him.\n        Now, look I deserve to know where I came from. All right? So\n        if you can help me find my Father then you should! Otherwise,\n        you’re just mean! (pause) So, just tell me the truth!",
        "My Father is Chuck Magioni?",
        "Oh.",
        "Heh?",
        "Hey! New wallet, huh?",
        "Oh please, somebody tell me I don’t have to go to work today!",
        "Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I’m not allowed to charge for.",
        "Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it’s against my oath as a masseuse.",
        "No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one’s actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.",
        "No, I can handle it. No, I’m a professional. (She starts to leave)",
        "I don’t what your talking about. (Laughs nervously and continues to leaqve)",
        "Because it’s Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!",
        "These old things.",
        "You mean the—Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.",
        "Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y’know, real (lifts up the towel) nice and tight. So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.",
        "Oh. (She goes to work, and her head slowly drops out of view.)",
        "No!",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.",
        "On the touchy.",
        "No, I know! I-I’m sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.",
        "(thinking to herself) Okay, baseball. Rick, playing baseball. Okay, slides into second, maybe even his pants come down a little… Oh no—wait no, no! No! Okay, all right, sandwiches, sandwiches. Umm, okay, on a plate, maybe Rick’s pants come down a little. No! No! Okay, Chandler! Okay Chandler, ooh, that’s working.",
        "(thinking to herself) Chandler’s knees. Chandler’s… ankles. Chandler’s ankle hair. (notices the clock) Oh no. (to Rick) Okay, you’re all set.",
        "Yeah! In… really long hour world.",
        "Ugh, okay, I have an enormous crush on you. But because you’re a client, I can’t ask you out, even though you give me y’know, the feeling.",
        "Really?!",
        "What?",
        "(laughs) Okay, quit down. (they start to kiss again)",
        "Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isn’t what it looks like, ‘cause Rick is my ahh, husband.",
        "Yes, I will tell her.",
        "Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.",
        "It’s so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!",
        "I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next, y’know? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then these policemen, thought I was a whore too. It’s been a really bad day, whore wise.",
        "Yeah, they thought I was a whore.",
        "Great! Thank you very much.",
        "How come?",
        "Okay, I didn’t hear that.",
        "Wow! And hey, it’s cool if you’re a lesbian! (Gives her a thumbs up)",
        "That’s weird.",
        "Your nails.",
        "Oh, no, I meant that it’s weird that you only have nine now.",
        "Okay, don’t panic. I’m gonna go to the store, I’m gonna get you another set of nails, no one’s gonna know, and you’re gonna look great. (She runs over to get her coat.) Oh! Oh, it’s ‘cause they’re gonna eat—that’s the problem.",
        "And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!",
        "I don’t get it.",
        "Op, the ruined quiches are ready.",
        "Hey!",
        "This used to be your room? (She nods ‘Yes’) Wow! You must’ve been in really good shape as a kid.",
        "Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.",
        "No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we’ll call that pulling a Monica.",
        "Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A’s, his parents would say, \"Yeah, he pulled a Monica.\" Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, \"Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica.\" Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, \"Yeah, that one’s outta here.\" Though some things don’t change.",
        "Wow! My breasts are really strong. (She goes and joins Monica.)",
        "They’re not even touching the lasagna!",
        "Oh, they love your casserole.",
        "It’s hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.",
        "Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. (They both look at her) (to Monica) She doesn’t know we switched it. (Monica nods her head ‘No.’)",
        "Oh.",
        "Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.",
        "Thank you.",
        "(entering) Oh.",
        "(in a nasally voice, from her cold) But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. (She puts her shoe on the table, and it's horribly decorated) Pretty, huh? (Sneezes)",
        "Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People. (Starts to sing) Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you? (Stops singing) This chick sounds good. (Singing) Smelly cat, smelly--(stops singing) Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.",
        "(singing, drunk) My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey.",
        "It's fun, God I love how sexy I am. (Coughs really loudly.)",
        "Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.",
        "Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.",
        "So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.",
        "Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that \"Woo-hoo\" thing.",
        "Hey.",
        "Hi.",
        "Wow, cute one!",
        "Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour. Hey, (clears her voice and in her normal voice) you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. Ooh, (tries to sing) My sticky shoes--eww! Eww! I lost my sexy phlegm!",
        "Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common.",
        "What?!",
        "Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!",
        "You mean you stole it! (Monica sneezes again) Don't cover your mouth when you do that!",
        "(entering) Hi! It's me. And soup. (to Rachel) Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket.",
        "(to Monica) Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water.",
        "(picking up Monica's used Kleenex and putting some in her pocket.) Sure.",
        "But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.",
        "It's okay. How's the soup?",
        "(singing) Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street. Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats. (to Gunther) Does it even work without my sexy voice?",
        "Gunther, kiss me.",
        "(singing) And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.",
        "Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?",
        "(singing) \"Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease…\" Darn it! Now, I don’t know who to get to the next verse.",
        "Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about ‘bah-bah-bha-bhan?’",
        "Oh yeah, that’s right, the keyboards, huh?",
        "I wanna hear \"The Sound.\"",
        "Come on, play that funky music white boy.",
        "Wow, it was so—wow!",
        "What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it’s just, it’s so different from the stuff you usually hear.",
        "(pushing Monica back onto the couch) It’s so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!",
        "Oh no, I’m not playing tonight.",
        "I can’t follow Ross! It’d be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.",
        "Oh my God, he’s not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!",
        "You guys. You suck too. (She hugs them both.)",
        "Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!",
        "Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Yeah, I-I can’t—I mean y’know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just—I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I…",
        "Oh no. No-no-no, don’t do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.",
        "Does Joey know?",
        "I think maybe, yeah.",
        "Yeah! No, that’s right. And I thought it was a really good idea.",
        "Oh my God, he’s lost it. He’s totally lost it.",
        "After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.",
        "Hey what are you guys looking at?",
        "Yeah, come to papa.",
        "Oo! Is it for my birthday present?",
        "Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?",
        "'Kay.",
        "Yeah, and what a great way to say, \"I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!\"",
        "It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!",
        "Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican... (Monica looks almost puzzled) ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?",
        "There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!",
        "Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.",
        "Yes, but I'm doing this.",
        "Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?",
        "Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.",
        "Mon! I'm so happy for you!",
        "I'll have one, please. Plus my money.",
        "Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank.",
        "Yes. Did you settle the bill?",
        "Oh, look what we almost left. (Picks up a coffee maker)",
        "Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!",
        "But Mon, you have to get our money!",
        "I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?",
        "Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, \"that massage wasn't long enough, or, \"I don't recognize any of those songs,\" or, you know, \"these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!\"",
        "Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.",
        "She seems fine now.",
        "You didn't get the money, did you?",
        "No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough! (Phoebe goes into the living room.) Hey, widow?",
        "Okay, Widow!",
        "Excuse me. Excuse me! (Mrs. Bukart stops singing) Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.",
        "Good. (Phoebe and Mrs. Burkart go into the other room, leaving Monica with everyone staring at her.)",
        "Uh... yay!",
        "Yeah. I'm a hard ass.",
        "Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!",
        "Okay!",
        "Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties!",
        "Look everyone, it’s the spirit of Thanksgiving!",
        "Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there’s the added mystery of who gets who.",
        "I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!",
        "Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it’s like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let’s trade!",
        "Ohh.",
        "You don’t have to do that, Ross and Joey aren’t here, you can watch the parade if you want.",
        "God, what happened?!",
        "Open it up, let me see.",
        "Ooh, God it looks bad.",
        "Honey, you’ve got to go. What’s his office number?",
        "(on phone) Hi! Yeah, I’m calling on behalf of Monica Geller’s eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. (Listens) (to Monica) He’s out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?",
        "Yes! She’s very excited about that.",
        "This is so cool, ‘til Monica gets back, it’s like I’m head chef and I get to make all the decisions. (She looks at the remaining butter, and then decides to add it to the dish.)",
        "Okay, get out of my kitchen!",
        "All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.",
        "Yeah, I can see where I’d be your best shot but, no. I’m sorry, but I think it’s twisted.",
        "Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, \"That’s not how your dad used to do it.\"",
        "Oh, I’ll get it. (goes over to the door.)",
        "Oh, he-he can’t talk right now.",
        "He’s just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.",
        "They were threefold.",
        "Oh, she sees him! Oh, they’re hugging!",
        "Oh, there they are!",
        "All right, get a room.",
        "Hey!",
        "Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth. (Joey, with an obvious mouth full, nods yes.)",
        "Where were you?",
        "Oh, which museum?",
        "(just Phoebe) No, answer his.",
        "Umm, that paper’s two weeks old.",
        "What’s wrong Mon?",
        "Oh.",
        "Hey, maybe they meant to write, ‘Quiet, bitch.’",
        "Hey! You guys, I’m writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?",
        "(singing) Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey! Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel!",
        "Oh, yay!",
        "I know but it’s so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!",
        "All good, thanks. (to Rachel) Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that’s easier to rhyme?",
        "Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?",
        "(shocked) You work with robots!!",
        "No! No, the robots just work for them.",
        "If she’s no fun, why do you want to date her at all?",
        "Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?",
        "(singing) Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry…",
        "What?",
        "So! Ross doesn’t really decorate his tree with floss, but you don’t hear him complaining do you? God! (Phoebe hits her guitar which wakes up Ross with a start.)",
        "So, did you pick one yet?",
        "Well look, you don’t really like the one from uptown and you’re too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you’re done!",
        "Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.",
        "There’s sooo much you don’t know.",
        "(singing) \"Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap.\n                                Asked him to bring my friends all kind of crap.\n                                Said all you need is to write them a song.\n                                They haven't heard it, so don't try and sing along.\n                                No, don't sing along.",
        "Okay!",
        "Okayyyyy, open up!",
        "Yeah, it’s for our catering business!",
        "No, we’re gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette.",
        "And also, we don’t know what to do with this. (She turns on a switch and the girl’s nipples light up.)",
        "Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.",
        "How could you say yes, what about our catering business?",
        "Oh, in that case—(hops up and down in joy)—Yay! (Monica looks confused) That was me hopping on board.",
        "Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?",
        "Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.",
        "Oh, okay! (reading) \"Would I go back to Allesandro’s? Sure, but I’d have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head.\" (to Monica) Wow! You really laid into this place.",
        "Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.",
        "No-no, it’s okay. But are we sure we don’t want the waterbed?",
        "Yeah, all right. (starts to leave)",
        "Bye!",

        "Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.",
        "But we’ve only had one job.",
        "Yeah! What are you saying?",
        "What?",
        "You’re the cook! With out you it’s just me driving up to people’s houses with empty trays and asking for money!",
        "For what? I can’t believe this! I gotta get out of here. (leaves)",
        "Okay, I’m hearing.",
        "What?!",
        "I wa-I wa-I wa…",
        "Monica!",
        "No.",

        "Really?! Are you sure?",
        "Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let’s plan the wedding reception. (She grabs the notebook which Monica used for her ideas and starts flipping page after page after page after page after page to find a blank one.) Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. (pause) Y’know what, I want you to take the chef job.",
        "Yeah. That’s what you really want. Yeah, I don’t want to be the reason you’re unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don’t want to be the reason I’m unhappy.",
        "Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.",
        "(holding a lure) So now, what is this now?",
        "(laughs and picks up another lure) And this?",
        "(laughs harder) You make it so funny.",
        "Hey!",
        "I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.",
        "Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.",
        "Don’t you just love the way they talk?!",
        "Ohh!",
        "It kicked! I think the baby kicked!",
        "Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.",
        "Why?",
        "Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?",
        "(going over to comfort her) Aww, Pheebs.",
        "That’s short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!",
        "Shhh!! Please! What’s he saying?",
        "What? Oh my God!",
        "Well, look, why don’t you just, why don’t you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.",
        "Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!",
        "Y’know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!",
        "I’m sorry. (Goes and hugs him)",
        "Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, ‘cause I’m pregnant.",
        "Ha-ha, it’s not my baby, ha-ha-ha! (He leaves.)",
        "(doing the same) I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.",
        "Come on! Look where you are!!",
        "Remember, a virgin for me please.",
        "Well, if you think it will help.",
        "You should! How is she?",
        "Who, Josh?",
        "Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, y’know what, you were right, you were right. We really weren’t great at being guys, but you know why? Because we’re girls.",
        "And do you know what girls are really good at?",
        "No, listening! Sit! Y’know, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk.",
        "Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh! What is that? What is that?",
        "Hey—ooh so, how was Vermont?",
        "I-I wanna be with her, (points to the stripper next to her) I like her.",

        "You guys, why didn't you tell me you were eloping?",
        "Wait, wait. Why were you at the courthouse?",
        "Wow, a year and a half ago I didn't even know I had a brother. Now I have a sister too!",
        "Okay. Okay. Stop it. Don't!",
        "So, ooh, I'm going to get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?",
        "That's a really *nice* gift. I was thinking of, like, a gravy boat.",
        "Hey!",
        "Guess what? Frank Jr. and Alice got married.",
        "And they're going to have a baby!",
        "Yeah! And they want me to grow it for them in my uterus.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Eww! And no, no! They want me to be the surrogate. It's her egg and his sperm. I'm just the oven. It's totally their bun.",
        "Well, they said I had to think about it first. But what is there to think of? I'm going to be giving someone the greatest gift you can possibly give.",
        "I know.",
        "Yeah, what's your point? [goes to sit on the couch]",
        "You know, you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.",
        "My mom never gave birth. Oh, but my birth mom did!",
        "[enters] Hi.",
        "Sorry I'm late.",

        "Hey, why don't you?",
        "Uh-huh, yeah!",
        "No, I'm really okay with this. You know why? Cause look at them. [Frank Jr. and Alice are laughing and playing with the puppy.] Look how happy there are. And I made that. I know it's going to be like a million times harder to give up a baby but oh my God! It's going to feel like a million times better, right? [Rachel and Monica look at her; both are teary]",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Oh, I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided I'm going to carry their baby.",

        "(to the player) Hi.",
        "Whoa! (The player leaves and to Joey) I kinda liked it.",
        "No offence but, y’know sometimes it’s hard to understand you, y’know with the accent, so…",
        "Oh, poor baby.",
        "She’s right! You have to stop!",
        "Now, are you sure you don’t want to go see a doctor?",

        "See? I’m doing it. I am totally doing it. (Suddenly it stops working.) I lost it.",
        "Hey!",
        "You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn’t be living in an apartment.",
        "All right. I’m gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I’m ready to have Frank and Alice’s embryo transferred into my uterus.",
        "Oh, they’re just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.",
        "Okay everyone, think thick.",
        "Hi! Wish me luck!",
        "Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.",
        "Embryossss? As in, \"More than one?\"",
        "Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?",
        "That’s it! 25 percent? That means that’s it’s like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!",
        "Okay, well y’know what, don’t worry you guys, ‘cause I’m-I’m gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.",
        "Whoa!! That—okay, that’s a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. (to Dr. Zane) So, well okay, so is there—is maybe is there something that I can do y’know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?",

Okay, and-and I promise that I’ll keep you safe and warm until you’re ready to have them take you home, so… Oh! And also, umm next time you see me, I’m screaming, don’t worry, that’s what’s supposed to happen.",
        "Uh-huh. (To the embryos) Good luck.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Umm, yeah, uh-huh, they’re implanted.",
        "Well, freaked. ‘Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alice’s like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket.",
        "All right, I’m gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now.",
        "Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body’s always been a little faster than Western medicine.",
        "Nope, not knocked up yet.",
        "Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, I’m gonna do whatever I can to help this so, I’m just gonna y’know, lie it your chair, (She climbs into the chair and drapes her feet over the back of the chair.) Y'know? Yeah, good, I’m let gravity y’know, do its jobs.",
        "(singing) \"Are you in there little fetus?\n                             In nine will you come great us?\n                             I will buy you some Adidas.\"",
        "Oh. Oh.",
        "All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, y’know just remember that it’s still really early, okay so, if it says that I’m not pregnant, that doesn’t mean that I’m not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so I don’t go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.",
        "Great. (Goes to take the test.)",
        "You guys! You guys! You’re gonna have a baby! They’re gonna have a baby!",
        "Okay, but this can’t be good for the baby.",
        "Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?",
        "Well, it’s just that maternity clothes are so expensive.",
        "Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?",
        "That sounds great!",
        "Hey!",

        "What? What?",
        "(getting up) Well, I hate to eat and run, but…",
        "Yeah, I don’t need it.",
        "Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?",
        "If you wanted to punish them, you should’ve just made them hang out here!",
        "Oh, are we gonna trash that place?",
        "Wait a minute.",
        "Why don’t you ask him out?",
        "He just got a divorce right?",
        "So he’s probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.",
        "(shocked) You’ve never asked a guy out?!!",
        "Thousands of times!! That doesn’t make me sound too good does it?",
        "Oh, please!",
        "I’ve never done that.",
        "No, sorry.",
        "Great!",
        "Oh did you—what did you—did you work for two days straight?",
        "Oh good!",
        "How? How is your fault?",
        "I-I can’t find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I’m telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake—ooh! Cake! (Chandler shrugs, and Phoebe grimaces.) No.",
        "God! Ooh! What is that smell? It’s coming from the bathroom. Ooh! (She goes to the bathroom.)",
        "It’s me. It’s Phoebe. Listen there’s something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?",
        "(she smells his head) No!",
        "Yes. Yes. Yes. I can’t believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can’t eat meat!",
        "(angered by the rubbing) Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y’know? And I got nauseous.",
        "Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.",
        "That’s sweat. You throw up all morning, you’ll have that glow too.",
        "Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?",
        "Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?",
        "Oooh, yeah. You’re a genius.",
        "Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!",
        "Y’know it doesn’t matter how much I’m craving it. Y’know why I’m never gonna eat meat? Because it’s murder, cold blooded murder.",
        "I can’t help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.",
        "Yeah, totally!",
        "Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I’m gonna eat like, y’know millions of cows.",
