        "Which one was Pete Carney?",
        "Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-\"I-win\"-guy. [imitating] \"I win! I win!\" I went out with the guy for two months--I didn't get to win once.",

        "You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.",
        "They're nice guys.",
        "Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'. ",
        "Uh, Ross.",

        "Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.",
        "Nope. Schhorry.",
        "I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.",
        "I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.",

        "Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?",
        "Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..",
        "..I dunno, a little too Alan?",
        "Oh, why is it unfair?",

        "Weeeell, it's rum, and-",
        "We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister.. (PHONE RINGS, MONICA GOES TO ANSWER)",
        "Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.",
        "(PHONE) Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? ...Yes, hold on. (TO RACH) Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.",
        "That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.",
        "(PAUSES, THEN, TO PHONE) Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?",
        "You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!",
        "Ah, the other Jack.",
        "So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.",

        "What?",
        "Yeah, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar. Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but hey, that's me. Why don't you try the hummus?",

        "Hide the Lamp.",
        "Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?",
        "Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.",
        "Phoebe, tell her!",

        "No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.",
        "You made it!",
        "No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.",
        "That's fine.",
        "Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.",
        "Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.",
        "They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?",
        "Oh, you are so great! [kisses him] Thank you!",
        "They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.",

        "Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.",
        "Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.",
        "Um, you guys, you know when I said before, \"thank you, but I don't really need your help\"?",
        "Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.",
        "If you want.",
        "All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.",
        "I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.",
        "All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!",
        "Joey, speed it up!",
        "Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?",
        "[to Ross] All right, you!",
        "All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called \"pigs in Ross\". All right, ball the melon.",
        "Hi.",
        "It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.[everyone groans]",
        "You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.",
        "So we're back on?",
        "You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.",
        "Would you look at them?",
        "Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?",
        "All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.",
        "Rose Marie really belongs on a smaller screen, doesn't she?",
        "[walks up to Rachel in front of the TV] Tonight?",
        "What's tonight?",
        "Uh, hello.",
        "Tonight you're supposed to waitress for me, my catering thing, any of those words trigger anything for you?",
        "Yes but my mom got me this job.",
        "Really Phoebs? Because, you know, you'd have to be an actual waitress. This can't be like your 'I can be a bear cub' thing.",
        "Sorry we're late.",
        "Dr. Burke, it, it's me.",
        "Thank you. This is my friend Phoebe. She's gonna be helping me tonight.",
        "I've been great, just great. How have you been? [tilting her head]",
        "The head tilt?",
        "I'm sorry.",
        "[her and Phoebe tilt their heads] Oh, that's too bad.",
        "You've got to get back out there, it's your party.",
        "You're an opthamologist.",
        "Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.",
        "I am not.",
        "Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up.",
        "Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.",
        "Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.",
        "Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age.",
        "Really.",
        "Good, they feel good, in my head.",
        "You too.",
        "OK, um. Goodbye.",
        "What?",
        "Thanks. So, I guess I better be going.",
        "Thanks again.",
        "Stop sending food to our apartment.",
        "No one.",
        "Nothing.",
        "Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental.",
        "It's Richard Burke.",
        "Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with.",
        "When?",
        "Wow, is that Michelle?",
        "I've not seen her since high school graduation. Oh my God, that night she got so dru. . . motional.",
        "I thought she just had one.",
        "Oh, you're a grandpa.",
        "I don't know, maybe. I mean I'm dating a man who's pool I once peed in.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So maybe we should just. . .",
        "Wow, this really sucks.",
        "Well, we don't really have to decide anything right now, do we?",
        "Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys.",
        "I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.",
        "Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?",
        "Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.",
        "Well, didn't you?",
        "I can't believe you didn't tell me.",
        "What have I not told you?",
        "Wait a minute, who told you? [turns to Chandler who's looking sheepish] You are dead meat.",
        "Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple.",
        "That is wild.",
        "Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.",
        "I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.",
        "Hell, I wanna see Joey.",
        "All I say is, she better get the job.",
        "You know, it still smells like monkey in there.",
        "Rachel, that's all we do.",
        "Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? [Rachel gives her a look from hell] That's fine.",
        "Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't cry. Why is he still crying?",
        "Maye it's me.",
        "There's my little boy. (Ben starts crying again)",
        "He hates me. My nephew hates me.",
        "What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?",
        "That is so funny. Let me see that. (throws the ball out the window)",
        "Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi-- ",
        "No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special. ",
        "No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and--oh my god.",
        "Oh my god.",
        "Is your tongue swelling up?",
        "All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital.",
        "Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot.",
        "Jacket now.",
        "Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.",
        "My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally. ",
        "That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?",
        "Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!",
        "Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts.",
        "That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.",
        "Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?",
        "Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?",
        "No. But I remember people telling me about it.",
        "Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.",
        "That was you?",
        "Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he's not crying.",
        "Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.",
        "Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.",
        "Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.",
        "Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.",
        "Cute.",
        "Ross, that is gorgeous!",
        "Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy.",
        "Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.",
        "Oh, wait a minute honey.",
        "Wow.",
        "Hi.",
        "I hope she's OK.",
        "How do you know exactly what she's going through?",
        "Just some stuff for the party.",
        "You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?",
        "Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.",
        "For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive.",
        "Rach, get the heat. [Rachel holds up her hand with wet fingernail polish] Ross, could you turn the heat down please?",
        "Ross, the heat!",
        "Well put it back.",
        "Here, let me try.",
        "Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.",
        "No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.",
        "[carrying an ice cube tray] Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. Alright.",
        "Really? I'm perfectly comfortable. [one of the guest opens the refrigerator] Hey, hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next. [she opens the refrigerator and leans into it]",
        "No, I will not cave.",
        "Ross.",
        "[to Ross] Looks like he's playin' baseball.",
        "Whatever.",
        "So, wait, you really did like my cookies?",
        "Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier.",
        "Honey, I'm sorry.",
        "(enters) Oh my god.",
        "I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.",
        "Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.",
        "Who is also in charge of purchasing.",
        "Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.",
        "Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!",
        "Oh, sorry.",
        "Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.",
        "Oh, thank you!",
        "All right, what's goin' on?",
        "Ok.",
        "If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.",
        "All of us.",
        "I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.",
        "Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.",
        "Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.",
        "It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.",
        "Like?",
        "Charity?",
        "Guys, we bought the tickets.",
        "Well, I guess now we can't go.",
        "You know what? You're right.",
        "All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.",
        "You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.",
        "You know, the guys are probably having a great time.",
        "That was amazing!",
        "Do I know you?",
        "Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?",
        "You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.",
        "Uh, wait, backstage?",
        "Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?",
        "Uh, good.",
        "No, I just, I fell down.",

        "(on phone) Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.",
        "Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.",
        "Great.",
        "Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing.",

        "Hi.",
        "So, what's this.",
        "Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?",
        "Oh, God forbid.",
        "Where have you been?",
        "No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.",
        "Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it.",
        "Because they made me.",
        "Anything larger back there?",

        "Oh, dad, turn it off.",
        "Dad, it is not. What's with the red light?",
        "Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper.",
        "I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.",
        "If you're not going then I don't want to go either.",
        "I can't believe you did that.",

        "Damnit Ross, get your butt out of the bathroom.",
        "Blow drying what, you have no hair.",
        "Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all over again .",
        "GET OUT YOU DUFUS!!",

        "I'm not a baby, you're the baby.",
        "You wanna get out of my face?",
        "Give me that.",
        "Hi sweetie, look before I forget, did I leave my diaphram at your place? Hi mom. [she starts throwing oranges at Ross who's looking pleased with himself]",
        "I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy?",
        "I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.",
        "It's my TV.",
        "Bite me.",
        "Oh that's great, why don't you tell mommy on me.",
        "OK, what're we gonna do about this?",
        "Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin- you been here.",
        "I just can't stand you being here all the time.",
        "Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?",
        "Ross, I hated you when we were kids.",
        "Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.",
        "Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way.",
        "Duh-huh!",
        "Now I love you. And not just 'cause I have to.",
        "Yeah. You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.",
        "Then I won't have to kill you.",
        "Yeah, thanks. You know what?",
        "If you really want to watch that Serengetti thing, you can.",
        "So what're you gonna do?",
        "Sure.",
        "[sings] They won't take you to the vet.",
        "Joey.",
        "Hey.",
        "A mirror?",
        "Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.",
        "Cache? Jaunty?",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh my God, it was incredible.",
        "Rachel you have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It's about how women need to become more empowered.",
        "It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard.",
        "No.",
        "Yes. But all the other ones.",
        "Isn't it.",
        "Hey.",
        "You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?",
        "Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh!",
        "I wa-",
        "And I would have to say pah-huh.",
        "Do you not remember the puppet guy?",
        "And his puppet too.",
        "Who?",
        "Oh.",
        "Woah, woah, woah, let's go back to 29.",
        "Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.",
        "One hour? You are such a leaf blower.",
        "We didn't order cake.",
        "You're right.",
        "We're good.",
        "Are you sure this time?",
        "There is no alley behind Macy's.",
        "So on this road trip, did you guys win any money?",
        "Nice.",
        "We, we just wanna see the end.",
        "Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place.",
        "Well, maybe you don't need them.",
        "Shut up, I'm happy.",
        "Not a lot, Phoebe's kidding, Phoebe's crazy.",
        "Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.",
        "Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with.",
        "Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?",
        "Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth. [goes in the bathroom]",
        "Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.",
        "Well yeah.",
        "You really ok with it?",
        "Oh, yay. Ok about that two.",
        "Well, it just seems like a really small number.",
        "And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?",
        "But you've only slept with two people.",

        "Hi. Richard just told me he loves me.",
        "I know. I just can't find...",
        "You need one too?",
        "There's only one.",
        "Hi. Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something. [shuts the bathroom door]",
        "No.",
        "Alright, I tell you what, I'll give this to you now if you can tell me where we keep the dustpan.",
        "Yeah.",
        "One two three. [Rachel picks rock, Monica picks scissors]",
        "Fine, go have s*x.",
        "It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow.",
        "Why?",
        "Wait, he's not here yet.",
        "Alright.",
        "Did they just kill off Joey?",
        "And some of us really have to pee.",
        "Sorry Joey [runs to the bathroom]",
        "Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.",
        "I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.",
        "Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.",
        "Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.",
        "Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.",
        "No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.",
        "OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.",
        "Happy birthday dad.",
        "Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.",
        "Are we still on that?",
        "I'm a twinkie.",
        "Oh, this is so hard.",
        "Maybe we should just tell your parents first.",
        "God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.",
        "Alright.",
        "You remember that video I found of mom and dad?",

        "Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.",
        "Well, uh, he's a doctor.",
        "No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him. [she puts her arm around Richard]",
        "Mom, it's OK.",
        "Dad, I'm the twinkie.",
        "Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . .",

        "Yes.",
        "Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier.",
        "Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.",
        "So, are you sorry that I told them?",
        "Oh. Well did you get it? Let me see.",

        "I'm just easing you in.",
        "Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.",

        "C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.",
        "So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag. [walks off]",
        "Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay.",
        "Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him?",
        "So'd you guys have fun?",
        "Really?",
        "So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?",
        "Ross.",
        "Look. [they look at Joey in the kitchen with a cigar in his mouth, looking at his reflection in a spatula] Joey, do you know we can see you from here?",
        "You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.",
        "So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?",
        "You're meeting Richard?",
        "Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys.",
        "With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?",
        "So you watched the movies huh?",
        "Alright, you wanna feel better?",
        "Ok, here, watch this.",
        "So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.",
        "There's a game?",
        "Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.",
        "Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.",
        "Oh, then go Vassar.",
        "Ok, then just go.",
        "Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.",
        "It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?",
        "I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.",
        "Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.",
        "Did you like it?",
        "Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?",
        "[enters] Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table.",
        "[grabs the other two bars on Richard's side and scores] Score! Now can we go?",
        "Um-hmm.",
        "Nighty-nite.",
        "[her and Richard return to her place] So are you ok?",
        "Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.",
        "Yeah, well they suck too.",
        "Then what's the problem?",
        "What, forget it!",
        "Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.",
        "Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him. (Rachel glares at her, and she retreats to safety between Richard's legs)",
        "Woo-hoo, stuud!",
        "Woo-hoo, geeek!",
        "Please!",
        "Bye sweetie, (kisses him) I love you.",
        "What are you talking about? What wedding?",
        "Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'",
        "Could not be more terrified.",
        "(holding up a blanket) Where's Benny? (drops the blanket) There he is! (does it again) Where's Benny, there he is.",
        "Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure. ",
        "Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?",
        "Yeah, am I in it?",
        "Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.",
        "Keep talkin'.",
        "Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?",
        "Not a basset, a bassinet.",
        "Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.",
        "(entering) Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs.",
        "So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.",
        "Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about.",
        "Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.",
        "You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I...(sees two little girls dancing together) I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do.",
        "You'll do what?",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Really?",
        "You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'",
        "Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.",
        "I know you do. Me too. (pause) So what now?",
        "No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.",
        "So, Chandler, who’s on your list?",
        "First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.",
        "Hey! Where ‘ya headin’ in those pants? 1982?",
        "Why, what’s wrong with my bathroom floor?",
        "I highly doubt that. (they both go to the bathroom)",
        "I can’t live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?",
        "That’s a little more than I wanted to see.",
        "I can’t leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.",
        "You know that’s nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!",
        "What kind of karate is that?",
        "So how’s it going with you guys?",
        "Oh honey, we’re close now but you-you wouldn’t believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and....(Phoebe shakes her head like she doesn’t understand) That’s where the waistband actually goes over your head.",
        "Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.",
        "Oh, how do you play the shadow game?",
        "I just asked you.",
        "No, that is what the game is.",
        "What’s the matter?",
        "He’s retiling my floor. (they both run to the bathroom)",
        "Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.",
        "It’s beautiful! It’s like the first bathroom floor there ever was. (Chandler tries to go to the bathroom) Whoa! Are you going in there for?",
        "And who laminated it?",
        "Are you serious? (they all look) Oh my God.",
        "Why? ‘Cause otherwise you’d go for it?",
        "Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?",
        "Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?",
        "I was always Joanne.",
        "I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. (they all stare at her) And I’m appalled for you by the way.",
        "What’s the part?",
        "Not at these prices.",
        "(lying down on a mattress) Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.",
        "(sees the bed) What’s this?",
        "This is not the bed I ordered!",
        "Phoebe!",
        "Why is this car in my bedroom?",
        "When did I sign for it?",
        "Did you make brownies today?",
        "(to Phoebe) Quick, take off your dress, he won’t notice the bed.",
        "Sometimes I have bad dreams. (starts to break down, and Phoebe offers her, her hand to comfort her.)",
        "Joey, you’re this guy’s teacher. I mean how could you do this?",
        "Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I’m the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.",
        "Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, (turns sideways\n        on the couch) so that you can bunny bump against my back.",
        "See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.",
        "Oh, now you want a pad.",
        "(entering from her bedroom) I gotta go to work. Has anybody\n        seen my left boob?",
        "There it is. Joey, what are you doing?",
        "What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to\n        feel something, you have to run away?",
        "Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant\n        until you get us to break up with you.",
        "Uff.",
        "That is never good.",
        "Ohh! (both grab there stomachs in pain)",
        "Welcome to our side of the tunnel.",
        "You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you\n        gotta switch to low-fat.",
        "Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just\n        need some damage control.",
        "Nooo!",
        "She has to know that your not ready.",
        "My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.",
        "You know what, everything's gonna be okay. ",
        "If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.",
        "Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you\n        just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.",
        "Aw, it's soo unfair. (they both start digging into the 'good'\n        ice cream)",
        "What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big\n        deal. You used to dress up like a woman.",
        "Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.",
        "The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.",
        "How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea. ",
        "Wasn't there a little song?",
        "(singing) 'I am Bea.'",
        "'I drink tea.'",
        "'....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '",
        "A-ha!!! (they all start laughing, as Ross hides in the\n        bathroom)",
        "(entering the shot) Ross!!! (starts to wipe up the\n              spill)",
        "(entering from bedroom) Okay, I’ll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I’m sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.",
        "Oh, then it must’ve been you. Bye. (leaves)",
        "(entering) Ross (who has his foot on the coffee table), foot on the floor or come over no more!",
        "What?",
        "Hi.",
        "Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.",
        "Chris says they’re closing down the bar.",
        "Yeah, apparently they’re turning it into some kinda coffee place.",
        "Got me.",
        "Hey, did you pick a roommate?",
        "Is it the Italian guy?",
        "He’s so cute.",
        "Oh look, the pool table’s free. Rack ‘em up. I’ll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.",
        "Oh my God, I went to high school with her. (to Rachel) Rachel! Hi!",
        "Oh my God, you can’t even see where the Titanic hit it.",
        "Awww, just like you always wanted. Congratulations",
        "Aww, not right now.",
        "I know.",
        "So, I’ll get-get back to my friend.",
        "Oh, that’d be great.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Bye! (to Chandler) Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my life.",
        "What are you doing with the lamp?",
        "Oh, well don’t take it to the same place you took the stereo, ‘cause they’ve had that thing for over a week.",
        "Hi, again.",
        "Thank you soo, much.",
        "You want some help with that?",
        "Whoa! Are you okay?",
        "It’s the heat. (has her hand on his chest, and then pulls it away) And-and the humidity.",
        "Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?",
        "Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.",
        "This place is really my Grandmother’s. (Joey starts to take off all of his clothes, while Monica gets the glasses and pours the lemonade.) I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I’m 87 year old woman, who’s afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?",
        "(turning around) Okay, here’s your pen1s!",
        "Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!",
        "So?!",
        "Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!",
        "I don’t believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have s*x?",
        "It’s okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.",
        "Pheebs?",
        "Where’s your bed?",
        "What?",
        "What are you talking about?",
        "Everybody knows!",
        "Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.",
        "What?!?!",
        "You can spill. In the sink.",
        "I love you, too.",
        "What? I’m just said.",
        "Hey.",
        "(all depressed) Help yourself.",
        "Phoebe moved out.",
        "I don’t understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don’t have a boyfriend?",
        "Well, I think so.",
        "I know, it is isn’t it?",
        "Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.",
        "Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.",
        "I know. Thanks. (Chandler leaves)",
        "Hey, are you okay?",
        "You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.",
        "So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?",
        "Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you\n        wanna show Rachel? Come here. (takes Ben) We’re gonna do\n        something fun. Okay. (throws Ben up in the air a little bit\n        and catches him) Weee!! (moves into the living room and does it\n        again) Weee!! (starts to walk back into the kitchen as she\n        does it again, and hits Ben’s head on that wooden beam across\n        the ceiling.)",
        "(to Ben) Who’s so brave, you’re so brave, yes you are,\n        you’re so brave.",
        "He’s not gonna say anything, because we’re not gonna tell\n        him.",
        "No we’re not.",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!",
        "Okay, we’re gonna need a distraction.",
        "I got it!",
        "The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take\n        him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that\n        makes him go, (high pitched) rweee!!",
        "A hat! Yes! We need a hat.",
        "Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?",
        "Because he’ll know what to do? (Rachel comes out of her\n        room with a bear that’s dressed in a rain suit.) Oh my God,\n        you’re a genius!",
        "Give it. Give it.",
        "It just makes more sense as an ensemble.",
        "Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.",
        "Sure, we have no money, go ahead.",
        "Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?",
        "Did he just say ‘Monica bang’?",
        "Oh my God! He’s gonna rat me out!",
        "Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that,\n        now. It’s no big deal, it’s not even worth mentioning, you see\n        we all do it all the time. See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben.\n        (goes over and starts hitting her head on the post) Ow, Monica\n        bang! (does it again) Everybody bang. (repeats) Ben bang.\n        (repeats) Rachel bang. (repeats) Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn’t\n        that fun?",
        "You okay?",
        "Okay, Ben, I won’t tell your daddy that you had ice cream\n        for dinner, if you don’t tell about our little bonking incident.",
        "Oh that’s right, that’s what I’d sound like if I exploded.",
        "All right, we should call somebody.",
        "How are we gonna do that? There’s no way.",
        "Yeah.",
        "No. Why?",
        "Really?!",
        "Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!! (runs into the bedroom)",
        "(coming out of the bedroom) You jerk! You know how\n        much I love that kid! (starts to chase Ross around the living\n        room)",
        "And yet, we’re still poking him.",
        "Um-mm.",
        "Wow. Joey, (sarcastically) how do you do it?",
        "He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.",
        "I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.",
        "All right, be my guest.",
        "Honey, what’s the matter?",
        "It’s Joey’s birthday.",
        "Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.",
        "I know honey, I’m sorry.",
        "(gives her a look) Gee, I don’t know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!",
        "Hey Gunther. Hi. (to Phoebe) I mean you’re going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?",
        "I know, he’s too charming, but if you two start going out, then it’s just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.",
        "Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?",
        "(to Chandler) Stick out your tongue.",
        "Oh my!!",
        "How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey’s sisters.",
        "Hi.",
        "Isn’t that great?",
        "Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, ‘Hummina-hummina-hummina.’ (walks away)",
        "How ya feelin’?",
        "What is the worse part?",
        "Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he’s actually going to kill you dead.",
        "I mean, was it Gina?",
        "No, no, no, that’s Dina.",
        "That was me.",
        "That’s okay.",
        "Y'know which one was she again?",
        "No honey, I’m sorry, but the weekend’s not over yet.",
        "I guess they’re back from their date.",
        "Oh my God!",
        "I am good. I finished my book.",
        "I don’t remember. Do you wanna take a walk?",
        "Wait a minute, why don’t you just call Mark. (they both look up in shock) I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you’ve got to make stuff happen.",
        "(to Ross) Honey, it’s not pushy, he gave her his home number.",
        "Yay!",
        "Oh, that is amazing!",
        "What?",
        "Are you crazy?!",
        "What?! Ross y'know this isn’t even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you’re right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?",
        "I mean don’t you trust her?",
        "Then get over yourself! Grow up!",
        "So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?",
        "Yeah, I do know.",
        "Y'know if it’s any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you. (Rachel nods in agreement)",
        "You broke a little girl’s leg?!!",
        "Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...",
        "All right, I’ll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that’s it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. (to Ross) Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?",
        "No.",
        "Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t do this.",
        "(she reaches out for it and stops) Oh God! I gotta go! (runs out)",
        "(comes up and starts looking through Ross’s cookie supply) Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?",
        "What?",
        "No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it’s no big deal, all right, I’m-I’m cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!",
        "(covers her neck) Oh God! (runs to the bathroom)",
        "Christmas cookie?",
        "(entering) Hey, guys. I’m here to pick out my Christmas tree.",
        "Is this the one that I threw out last year?",
        "Oh honey, is that ‘cause your Mom died around Christmas?",
        "Oh. (turns and looks at Joey, who gives a ‘way-to-go’ thumbs up and smile.)",
        "(jumping up from behind the couch) Merry Christmas!!",
        "Please, I'm not going for anything.",
        "Would you please go?",
        "Look Julio, someone left their book here.",
        "Oh yeah, what are you reading?",
        "Have I read it? (pause) No, are you enjoying it?",
        "Your a poet and don't know it. (she turns away and makes a face like 'I can't believe I just said that.')",
        "Oh, then you do know it. (pause) So um what kind of things do you write about?",
        "Mine? (points to her lower lip) Right here?",
        "How would that go? (they kiss) Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.",
        "(entering) Hi!",
        "It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem.",
        "Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out. (hands them the poem)",
        "Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs?",
        "Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work. (tries to take the poem)",
        "All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh-ho, look what I got Julio.",
        "Yeah, just like the one in the poem.",
        "What do you mean?",
        "(to Julio) So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?",
        "Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.",
        "You don't even know me...",
        "What?",
        "I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...",
        "(sarcastically) Oh yeah.",
        "Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.",
        "Every year.",
        "Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the ‘Geller Bowl.’",
        "Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind’ve competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross’s nose.",
        "To score the winning touchdown, by the way.",
        "(to Chandler and Joey) I won the game.",
        "Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it’s been twelve years.",
        "(shouting) Once!!",
        "Okay. Let’s bring it in.",
        "Well, why don’t we just bunny up.",
        "Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.",
        "Phoebe.",
        "All right people listen, I’ve got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.",
        "Huddle up.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay, Phoebe you know what you’re doing right?",
        "Okay, Joey’s gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block.",
        "Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you’re doing?",
        "Break.",
        "Score!! 7 to nothing!",
        "Losers walk!",
        "Come on guys! Let’s go! Come on, it’s second down.",
        "No it’s not, it’s second.",
        "Wow, what?",
        "Pulling what? It’s second down.",
        "I heard that!",
        "All right, come on guys, let’s go! Tie score, and we’re runnin’ out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike! (the timer sounds as Monica throws the ball to Phoebe.)",
        "Run, Phoebe, run!",
        "After the snap!",
        "Does so count!",
        "Y'know what, that’s fine, maybe you haven’t grown up, but I have.",
        "Dead leg!! (kicks him in the thigh.)",
        "No! Listen, I’m not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can’t blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let’s just call this, tie score and it’s halftime.",
        "Y'know what? I’ll think you’ll play.",
        "Because the winner gets this!",
        "When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.",
        "No it’s not! You want it, you’re gonna have to win it!",
        "Come on Phoebe, let’s go! Come on, it’s time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.",
        "All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?",
        "All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I’ll take care of the rest.",
        "Break!",
        "Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don’t see that everyday, do ya?",
        "What?! I just touched him and he went over.",
        "Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!",
        "You’re so pathetic! Why can’t you just accept it, we’re winning because I’m better than you.",
        "Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I’ll prove it to you, okay. I’ll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I’ll still win the game.",
        "Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.",
        "Come on Rach, come on. Let’s see what’s it like to be on a winning team for a change.",
        "All right then.",
        "Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.",
        "We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you’re making out...",
        "Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let’s kill ‘um!",
        "All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we’re down by two points. Two points.... (she gets interrupted by the guys, who are doing a slow-motion high five.) Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.",
        "Honey, there’s a reason.",
        "All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I’ll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.",
        "Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!",
        "No! I’m not okay!",
        "Come on! Come on! Hurry! We’re running out of time! Huddle up!",
        "All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.",
        "Break!",
        "Let go! I’m a tiny little woman!!",
        "Ow!!",
        "Let go!",
        "No!",
        "I don’t know. I guess the other people just don’t care enough.",
        "Let go!",
        "(to clerk) Hi.",
        "Six? I just had it for one night. It’s three.",
        "Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you’re gonna have to help me out here, ‘cause I only have three.",
        "Oh my God. Richard? (turns around) Hi!",
        "Wow! Your lip went bald. (Richard pays the clerk) Hey, thanks.",
        "Right.",
        "What?",
        "(removes them) That’s because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it’s static cling. Or maybe it’s just that God knew I’d be running into you and saw an opportunity.",
        "It’s good to see you too.",
        "You see that guy? He’s in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he’s going straight to the p0rn.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Me too.",
        "Oh, um, I don’t know if that’s a good idea.",
        "No, I just I think that it’s too soon.",
        "(entering from her bedroom) Morning.",
        "Yeah well, I ran into Richard.",
        "Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.",
        "Tomorrow night.",
        "It’s not a date, okay. I’m just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.",
        "We’re not gonna have s*x! Okay, nothing’s changed here. He still doesn’t want children and I still do, so that’s why we’re just gonna be friends.",
        "You say ‘Thank you very much,’ and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we’re gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we’re gonna start squishing the tomatoes.",
        "You touch people’s eyeballs every day and this feels weird.",
        "Oops.",
        "Gotta keep squishing.",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.",
        "Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it (does so) and it should umm, be.....",
        "Umm, you’ve got some on your pants.",
        "So, how’d the lasagne go over? (listens) Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. (listens) Yeah, I’ve been thinking a lot about you too. (listens) I know. It’s hard this whole platonic thing. (listens) It’s a word!",
        "Yeah, I do think it’s better this way. (listens) Yeah, we’re being smart. (gets up to answer the door) (listens) Yes, I’m sure.(she opens the door and it’s Richard)",
        "I’ll call you back. (starts kissing him)",
        "So we can be friends who sleep together.",
        "Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?",
        "Oh.",
        "No! (pushes him) No!",
        "‘Cause if you do that means you’d be cancelling it for me, and we’re just friends.",
        "Hi.",
        "You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, (opens her coat revealing a large burn mark over her left breast.) in a grill fire.",
        "What are you smiling at?",
        "Yeah, right.",
        "I love this friend thing!",
        "Ow!",
        "Oh my God! Oh my God! (She frantically tries to clean up the bedroom as Richard starts the tour.)",
        "(still hiding under the blankets) So um, who was she?",
        "(still hiding under the blankets) Did you like her? And I’m just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.",
        "(gets up) Okay, y'know what, I’m not fine, I’m not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... (pause) Y'know what, what if we’re friends who don’t see other people?",
        "Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.",
        "That’s not true, you don’t have a moustache.",
        "Y'know what, I’ve got to walk out of here right now, ‘cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don’t think I could do it again.",
        "How ‘bout one last game of racquetball?",
        "Watch the thorns!",
        "Hey.",
        "How’s the big anniversary dinner?",
        "Ohhh, nice.",
        "What?! (She accidentally starts the blender without the lid on it and fruit flies everywhere.)",
        "That’s okay, this is more important than fruit (pause) (angrily) on my ceiling! You broke up?!",
        "Oh no!!",
        "Rachel, you and Mark?!",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh, there’s banana on it.",
        "So then you know? (Phoebe nods her head)",
        "Oh, good. Thanks.",
        "Okay, all right don’t judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....",
        "Yes! Have you seen it?",
        "I know!!",
        "Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!",
        "Did that!",
        "Okay. (Does so.) Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!",
        "No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.",
        "That’s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don’t believe me, please, by my guest.",
        "Now, are you glad we didn’t start with the bikini strips?",
        "Ow!",
        "Ow!! Ow!!",
        "It’s okay, it’s okay.",
        "We were just waxing our legs.",
        "That’s right.",
        "What?",
        "(going over to listen at the door) Rachel said everything was okay.",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Oh!! (hits Chandler and Joey in the head) You guys knew about this and you didn’t tell us?!",
        "(stopping him) What, what are you doing? You can’t go out there.",
        "Because they’ll know we’ve been listening.",
        "What if they don’t?",
        "Hey. It’s three in the morning. They don’t know that I’ve come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.",
        "I won’t give you anything, but you’ll owe me 2.95.",
        "Why? (in a motherlike tone) Do you have a report due?",
        "Okay, let’s start with the free messages outside the UN.",
        "Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what country is this guy from?",
        "Where’s that?",
        "I don’t have an atlas.",
        "Oh, but wait I do have a globe.",
        "Hold on.",
        "‘Kay, here you go. (Hands her this tiny little globe.)",
        "It’s a globe and, a pencil sharpener.",
        "Oh, no thanks.",
        "Well, if you don’t have anything to copy, why are you going down there?",
        "Wow! It’s small.",
        "So you had fun, huh?",
        "No.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh no, she’s still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her.",
        "All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. (holds up a notepad) Call Rachel.",
        "Oh that’s my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. (to Phoebe) She’s fancy.",
        "Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?",
        "Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? (Mischa laughs) Why? What did I say?",
        "Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.",
        "I’m also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.",
        "Well, I was having a conversation.",
        "What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?",
        "Oh. (to Phoebe) Can I have a tissue?",
        "Hey, the man’s dog just died.",
        "It will be my pleasure. (to Phoebe) My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can’t even say coupons. (they leave)",
        "(to Phoebe) Look at you. All jealous.",
        "Yeah, sure.",
        "Y'know those are a delicacy in India.",
        "Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?",
        "Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.",
        "Hey.",
        "No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.",
        "Yeah, Ginger something.",
        "No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, (singing) ‘the movie star.’",
        "Well, what did you do?",
        "Y'know what, don’t tell us. We’ll just wait until Chandler gets home, (to Phoebe) because it’ll be more fun that way.",
        "You gave her food poisoning!?",
        "Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?",
        "Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.",
        "Phoebe why don’t you just call her? You obviously want to.",
        "Well, don’t ‘cha wanna?",
        "Okay, well I do know you.",
        "Well so?",
        "(entering) Hi!",
        "Oh, can I borrow this? (points to his milk) My milk’s gone bad.",
        "So umm, how was your date with Ginger?",
        "Sounds like she’s got the ah, whole package.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Sorry, Pheebs.",
        "We’d love too.",
        "Wow! It’s like Rachel in High School.",
        "Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!",
        "Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?",
        "No! Rachel is meeting us here.",
        "It’s never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.",
        "(seeing her) Okay, let’s go!! Let’s hit the road!!",
        "Let’s get the show on it!",
        "Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it’s sooo close.",
        "We’re sorry honey.",
        "Very bad.",
        "Chandler!!",
        "Weren’t you nine?!",
        "We’re really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.",
        "Noo! I’ll stay. He’s my brother.",
        "No! We’re gonna have fun. We can make fudge!",
        "Why? Do you think he’s still mad at us?",
        "No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.",
        "What?",
        "Ow!",
        "(getting out) No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.",
        "So, if you’re parents hadn’t got divorced, you’d be able to answer a question like a normal person?",
        "What?!",
        "Please!!",
        "These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it’s gotta be Rachel.",
        "All right then, your bra would still be big.",
        "Chandler!!",
        "Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?",
        "Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.",
        "So the going for help went well?",
        "Then why are you smoking?",
        "(running over to stop Rachel) Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let’s stock up. (takes her into the bathroom)",
        "(reading the sign) What’s ‘pleh’?",
        "Huh. What’s doofus spelled backwards?",
        "I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?",
        "Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?",
        "Here we go again.",
        "(shyly) I don’t know.",
        "What I said was, was that I understood. Joey’s the one who agreed with you!",
        "All right, we’ll call you when we get back.",
        "(to Joey) What’s so funny?",
        "Oh. (she laughs)",
        "Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don’t you think he’s a little young to get married?",
        "So, um, how-how did you guys meet?",
        "And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I’ve only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.",
        "(to a customer) Pete, can I get you something else?",
        "Haven’t you and I covered that topic?",
        "Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.",
        "I mean really, think about it.",
        "Nah, he doesn’t do anything for me.",
        "Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids…. (realises) All right, I get your point.",
        "Hey.",
        "Uh, yeah.",
        "Here you go.",
        "As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I’d call him.",
        "That’s Bill Clinton.",
        "Oh my God! That’s Pete! But why is Bill huggin’ Pete?",
        "I’m not gonna go out with him.",
        "Or incredibly offensive.",
        "What the hell is this? (holding up the check)",
        "Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?",
        "You’re supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what’s-what’s the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?",
        "What?!",
        "Okay, umm, you’re a loon.",
        "I don’t know.",
        "‘Cause I don’t want to encourage this kind of behaviour.",
        "Guys, please, I’m just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?",
        "I know!!",
        "(opening the door) (to Pete) Hey!",
        "And that’s why, I’m not inviting you in for a drink. (starts to leave) Bye.",
        "(in the hallway) So, where do you want to go?",
        "Oh, that’s sounds great.",
        "Oh come on, it’s only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?",
        "Why, how much is that?",
        "Oh, this is so great.",
        "All right then. (He leans in to kiss her goodnight, but she quickly kisses him on the cheek and pats his shoulder.) Bye.",
        "Hello, people who do not live here.",
        "I gave you a key for emergencies!",
        "He’s great! I mean we have such a good time together! He’s so funny, and sooo sweet, and I’m not attracted to him at all!!",
        "Noo!! It’s driving me crazy. I mean every other way he’s like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.",
        "Two.",
        "Absolutely! (He goes to kiss her, but she stops him and rubs his head and says...) Now get out of here you!! (Pete leaves) (to the gang) Okay, I’m running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there’s no future? Either they’re too old, or they’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me, and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something’s wrong with me?!",
        "Sure.",
        "(looks around) Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I’m gonna say, midget rodeo.",
        "Okay. Umm, y'know, I don’t think, I don’t think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.",
        "So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn’t the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I’m just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?",
        "I so wanna be attracted to you.",
        "I’m sorry.",
        "It’s not?",
        "Well, um, look I-I don’t want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn’t attracted too.",
        "Hey, Rach, how was work?",
        "By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.",
        "Something wrong?",
        "Wow, you’re really crazy about her, huh?",
        "Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!",
        "Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! (Ross gives her a look) (to Ross) And I’m sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?",
        "I get the dollhouse!",
        "Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.",
        "Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.",
        "Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper’s a little faded, that’s okay. Carpet’s a little loose. Hardwood floors!!",
        "I know!!!",
        "Okay.",
        "What’s this?",
        "Not one that can pee on the roof.",
        "I don’t want a ghost.",
        "Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that’s it, that’s it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They’re not the right size, they’re not Victorian, and they just don’t go.",
        "It’s very interesting, Phoebe.",
        "Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!",
        "You’re kidding?! That’s great!",
        "Oh my.",
        "Come on Rach, when a guy says he’s going to call, it doesn’t mean he’s going to call. Hasn’t it ever happened to you?",
        "Hmm, bite me.",
        "(from the bathroom) I’m in the shower!",
        "Oh, that’s okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.",
        "(runs over to her) I tried to reach you at work. There’s....been a fire.",
        "Well, the giraffe’s okay. And so is the pirate.",
        "I need two. I’m bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now!",
        "Really? Who’s number two?",
        "Bye-bye!",
        "Joey, what are you doing?! It’s never gonna happen, she’s seeing somebody.",
        "(to Phoebe) Here you go. You can wear this. (hands her a sweater)",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Phoebe?",
        "All right. Honey, that’s-that’s a sleeve. Okay?",
        "And! We also have speaker phone. (She turns on the speaker phone.)",
        "Okay, wait, you gotta hang up ‘cause we’re gonna be late.",
        "Of course not.",
        "There’s our star!",
        "Hi!",
        "Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah. Where were you?",
        "You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.",
        "(entering from her bedroom) Pheebs, you’ve been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn’t healthy.",
        "Hey! Didn’t you have that outfit on last night?",
        "Anyway, how did it go with Kate?",
        "Joey, you had the night!",
        "When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!",
        "Did you like learn about her family?",
        "Yes!!",
        "Oh! (They hug, triumphantly.)",
        "One.",
        "We’re kidding!",
        "Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.",
        "Phoebe, it’s been two days.",
        "What?",
        "(sarcastic) Oh.",
        "(closing the fridge in disgust) Shoot! We’re out of soda.",
        "Really?!",
        "Sweety, what are you talking about?",
        "Oh.",
        "Ennnh.",
        "(screaming in pain) Ow!! Ow!!!",
        "Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!",
        "It’s like two miles!",
        "Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!",
        "What?! What is it?!",
        "What?!! Gross!!",
        "Well forget it! It doesn’t hurt that (tries to take a step) baaad!!!!",
        "Nothing, I don’t know.",
        "Nothing. I’m gonna take a shower.",
        "Pass the cheese, please.",
        "My God, you can’t even look at me! Can you?",
        "What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.",
        "(stopping him) No! Joey, we swore we’d never tell!",
        "(interrupting) All right!! All right. (walks slowly into the living room) I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn’t stand. I-I couldn’t walk.",
        "I was in too much pain.",
        "You can’t say that!! You-you don’t know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn’t...bend that way. So... (looks at Joey.)",
        "You bet.",
        "Hey!!",
        "(sets down some cards) Gin.",
        "Will you stop!",
        "Okay, all right, I think you’re great, I think you’re sweet, and you’re smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "You’re not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over...",
        "So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm...",
        "(Robin is speaking loudly again) I...",
        "Forget it. (they all turn and listen to Billy and Robin)",
        "(pause) I have no idea.",
        "He didn’t ask me to marry him.",
        "He wanted to tell me he’s gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.",
        "I don’t know exactly. It’s-it’s sorta like wrestling.",
        "Yeah, but without the costumes.",
        "So you can like, bite, and pull people’s hair and stuff?",
        "What’s fish hooking?",
        "I gotta tell ya, I think it’s okay to be that guy.",
        "Okay, can we please go eat?",
        "(to Chandler) Anything but stew.",
        "(entering) Hi!",
        "Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don’t want you to get hurt, ‘cause I kinda like you.",
        "Promise me you’ll be careful.",
        "Hey, are we still on for tonight?",
        "Okay, good, ‘cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...",
        "How ‘bout just a boom?",
        "God Ross, what is that?",
        "I love you, Pete!!!",
        "(going up to the ring) Pete! Pete!! That guy’s pretty huge!",
        "Hey! (she sits down next to him) It’s me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.",
        "I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.",
        "Well, you’re not gonna get going are you?",
        "Well, no. But...",
        "That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!",
        "You didn’t know that already?",
        "Okay, just get a lot better. (pause) Fast.",
        "Yeah. That-that was the problem.",
        "(joining them) Hey.",
        "Oh, about five minutes. Right now they’re interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.",
        "Four, please. (Ross looks at her) I’m really nervous. (Ross gives her the four dogs) Thank you. (she grabs four buns, and heads back inside)",
        "Please tell me you’re stopping now.",
        "You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!",
        "Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!",
        "Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you’re gonna have to do it without me.",
        "Then I’ve gotta go. Bye. (kisses him and starts to walk out)",
        "Yes?",
        "Really?!",
        "Pete's breaking up with me.",
        "I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk.",
        "Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.",
        "Really?!",
        "(starting to get up) I gotta go water Pete's plants. (stops) Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.",
        "Yeah. Which one do you like more?",
        "Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! (the lights turn on automatically, but are very bright) Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away! (they dim) Oh, see you just need to find the right command.",
        "No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.",
        "I know.",
        "Joey, put that down! (the phone rings) Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone! (steps in front of it, and automatically answers it)",
        "I guess that's how.",
        "Oh it’s umm, good! It's umm, it’s good, just here watering the plants.",
        "Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news.",
        "Oh no-no-no, it's still me.",
        "Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon.",
        "I love you.",
        "Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.",
        "Oh my.",
        "And that's Pete's Mom.",
        "Would you stop? We’ve only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don’t even know if he’s gonna propose.",
        "Well if-if that’s what it is, then it’s-it’s crazy.",
        "Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.",
        "Brides magazines?",
        "It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. (Rachel slams the magazine shut in amazement.) I know it’s a little sudden, and it’s a little rushed, and it’s totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn’t mean I can’t. Right? I mean I’m-I’m crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.",
        "I know. (pause) I need more pie. (goes and gets some)",
        "So then, are you going to dump Jason?",
        "Ooh, nice.",
        "Oh, right! I completely forgot about that.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Wow.",
        "What’s that?",
        "Okay. (not sure of herself)",
        "You wanna what?!",
        "What are you talking about?",
        "And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.",
        "My parents will be so happy.",
        "Joey, she was listing the countries she’s done it in.",
        "(watching a happy couple walk by, arm in arm) Would you look\n        at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die\n        an old maid.",
        "(sarcastic) Thanks!",
        "Yeah right.",
        "You made a joke right? So I laughed.",
        "Well, no. You’re Chandler. Y'know, Chandler! (hits him on the\n        arm)",
        "Well I’d probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.",
        "Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!",
        "Seriously, where did you get the hat?",
        "What’s with all this sand? (picking a handful of sand off of\n        the floor, which is covered in sand)",
        "What?!",
        "What are you crazy?!",
        "Aww, thank you.",
        "(to Phoebe) So what’s Phoebe like?",
        "Ah no, the other Phoebe, the one you went to go see.",
        "Oh well, where is he?!",
        "(gasps) Totally familiar. (Phoebe shows the rest of them.)",
        "Well, why would she lie to you?",
        "Strip Happy Days Game?",
        "I think I’ll help her out. (She gets up to go over and help\n        Rachel, and reveals she has no pants.) (to Rachel) What is\n        going on here?",
        "You painting his toenails?",
        "Chasing him all around the room?",
        "He’s totally flirting with you too.",
        "Huh?",
        "You didn’t even take off your pants.",
        "What?",
        "Like a log.",
        "That’s that weird voice again.",
        "Yesss!!",
        "Shhh!",
        "Chip, is Chip Matthews.",
        "‘Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.",
        "I know!! (calls him) (on phone) Chip? Hi! It’s Monica. (listens) ‘Kay. (listens) ‘Kay. (listens) Okay. (listens) Okay, good-bye. (hangs up) Oh my God, we just had the best conversation!! (goes into her room as Rachel enters)",
        "Hey!",
        "Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?",
        "What, that little thing at the prom?",
        "Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?",
        "Look, you and I went to different high schools...",
        "You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip’s motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.",
        "It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.",
        "Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he’s-he’s called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.",
        "Oh, really?!",
        "I’ll try.",
        "Why can’t you use the phone in here?",
        "Ross, don’t start.",
        "Oh, but it’s made her so happy.",
        "He is right, isn’t he?",
        "Hi!",
        "(sliding into Joey’s place on the couch to try and talk to Phoebe) Huh? What’d ya say Joe? I’ll be right there. (gets up and joins Joey)",
        "(running from the bathroom to her room, wearing only a towel) Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! (gets to her room and closes the door, as Rachel gets up to answer the door.)",
        "Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!",
        "That’s what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you’re Chip. Nevermind.",
        "Wow! A lipper from Chipper.",
        "Umm. Well, there’s Rachel, and umm, I think that’s it. How bout you?",
        "Is that all?",
        "Ohh, how is he?",
        "Isn’t he an architect now?",
        "Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, ‘cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don’t even know where you work?",
        "I do?",
        "You still work at the multiplex?",
        "Thanks, I’m set. Do you still live with your parents?",
        "(entering) Oh my God! What happened?",
        "Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?",
        "Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.",
        "No, it’s okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.",
        "I know!",
        "Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.",
        "Me too. (they all leave)",
        "(Entering from her bedroom) How desperate am I?",
        "I just told my Mom I’d cater a party for her.",
        "Because I need the money, and I thought that it’d be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.",
        "You don’t have to stick up for her. She can’t here you.",
        "Doing great, the quiches are coming along.",
        "Yeah, I thought it was cute.",
        "Let me ask you a question.",
        "Why did you hire me?",
        "(to Phoebe) Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I’m good.",
        "Oh yeah, she didn’t hire me out of pity, it wasn’t so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I’m good.",
        "…I think he deserves a Nobel Prize. (Joey starts to nod ‘Yes.’)",
        "What?",
        "Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn’t give me grief about me biting them.",
        "(Looks at her nails) Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put… (realises) Oh my God! It’s in the quiche! Oh My God!",
        "Okay ah, please don’t freak out. Umm, but ah, there’s a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there’s no way to know which one.",
        "Then why are you laughing?",
        "What? You bet I’d lose a nail?",
        "Frozen lasagnas?",
        "You bet that I’d screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was…",
        "You promised Dr. Weinburg, you’d never use that phrase.",
        "(laughs) That’s right. My Mom doesn’t have any faith in me! Oh, that’s hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.",
        "(interrupting) No! You have lasagnas! (Storms out and an awkward silence follows.)",
        "Hi.",
        "Ohh, I’m such an idiot. I can’t believe I actually thought she could change.",
        "Oh good, I’m glad that’s catching on.",
        "What?",
        "(getting up) All right, I’ll go down there. But, I’m not gonna serve the lasagna. I’m gonna serve something I make.",
        "Well?",
        "Really?!",
        "Yes!!",
        "And you?",
        "So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you…",
        "Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.",
        "Wow!",
        "That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don’t bite your nails.",
        "(in a sexy voice) Hello, Chandler. (Phoebe has a huge smile on her face.)",
        "Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?",
        "Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War? (Joey is pissed)",
        "Rachel!",
        "You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!",
        "Have you ever taken out the trash? (Hands her the garbage.)",
        "Third door on the left.",
        "God! If you’re gonna cry about it! (She grabs the box and goes to through it out.]",
        "Joey, please don’t do that. I think it’s best that we just forget about it.",
        "(Picking up a card from Chandler’s wallet.) My God! Is this a gym card?",
        "What’s the matter?",
        "So do them for free.",
        "Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.",
        "You’re gonna do some feet flirtin’!",
        "What a minute, what did he say?",
        "I told you not to go down there!",
        "Rachel always cries!",
        "Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you’ve never sucked before!",
        "His dancing partner?!",
        "Oh, would you let it go already?! You’re fine!",
        "Wait, now so you joined the gym?",
        "Well, you could actually go to the gym.",
        "Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.",
        "Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?",
        "Yes you did! You did like a little hop.",
        "(laughing harder) You know the words! You are so into this!",
        "All right, then show me some manly moves.",
        "So you didn’t leave the bank?",
        "Oh my Gosh!",
        "Just go up to her and ask her out. (Chandler laughs) Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?",
        "Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.",
        "Just be yourself. But, not too much.",
        "That cold makes you sound so great.",
        "Y'know what, I like Kathy.",
        "Monica:",
        "(turning around and doing that, \"I'm making out with someone,\" thing with her hands) Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh! (She turns around and sees Gunther staring at her and stops suddenly.)",
        "Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?",
        "Hey!",
        "Rachel's not here.",
        "How's it going with her?",
        "Hi, Josh.",
        "So, did you play in college? (She points to his NYU Soccer (football for the rest of the world) sweatshirt he's wearing.)",
        "Very!",
        "It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.",
        "Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.",
        "Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.",
        "(sneezes) Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.",
        "(lying on the couch suffering from her cold) Ross isn't here.",
        "What?",
        "Why?",
        "Thank you so much Phoebe.",
        "What are you doing with those?!",
        "Sorry, Phoebe.",
        "Umm. (nodding her head, \"Good.\")",
        "Ohhhh!! Gross!!",
        "No, sorry.",
        "Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?",
        "Ross, cough drops, please?",
        "(interrupting) You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!",
        "And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'",
        "That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!",
        "Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.",
        "That was you?!",
        "Hi! Hey, Pete you’re back! Hey, check this out. (She starts to\n        skate over to him)",
        "Wow! You’re a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a\n        piece of paper. So how was you’re trip?",
        "Oh, what’d ya bring me?! (She opens the gift) Awww, hotel\n        toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent\n        collection. You want some coffee?",
        "(popping back up) Regular or decaf?",
        "Okay. (hands him a cup)",
        "So what did you do today Pete?",
        "What?! Oh.(She turns around quickly and falls)",
        "Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?",
        "I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy\n        Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica’s Bakery. I mean I would kill\n        for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows\n        I paid my dues. (She removes her fake breasts) But Pete’s just\n        doing this because he has a crush on me.",
        "Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him?\n        I-I-I-I can’t. I couldn’t even accept a necklace from Stu\n        Vincent in the seventh grade.",
        "Oh, please. ",
        "What? Honey.",
        "Oh God, I’m so sorry.",
        "Oh God!",
        "Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel\n        Sanders. (Ross starts to leave) Ross! Ross! I’m kidding!",
        "What-what was it you were gonna tell us? ",
        "Okay. Here’s the thing.",
        "I can’t do it. I’m sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have\n        these feelings for me....",
        "Huh?",
        "Oh?",
        "Oh, that’s great! I mean I’m-I’m sorry, but I’m so happy for\n        you. And now I can work for you!",
        "Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! (she rolls over and\n        kisses him on the cheek) All right, y'know what? I’m just\n        gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!",
        "Okay. (she gets ready to go) Can you give me a little push?",
        "(rolling towards the office) I’m quitting!! Woo-hoo! (She\n        rolls through a doorway and out of sight. We then hear a big\n        crash, and see Monica roll past the door the other way.) I’m\n        okay!! I’m all right!!",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey, guess what I’m doing tonight.",
        "I’m checking out the restaurant with Pete.",
        "I know.",
        "What?",
        "Okay, but wouldn’t it be easier if you had to tell me\n        something that you could tell me.",
        "Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?",
        "Does it have to do with Joey?",
        "Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he\n        keeps by his bed?",
        "Does it involve travel?",
        "Does it involve clogs?",
        "Clogs.",
        "Claws?!",
        "Okay, so it doesn’t involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey.\n        But, what about Pete?",
        "What is it?! What about Pete?",
        "Okay, I feel like I’m talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe\n        would you just tell me!",
        "Okay, I gotta go. (gets up)",
        "Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete’s computer\n        company?",
        "I don’t believe this! Wow, look at this refridgerator! It’s\n        gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I’d be cold, but\n        I’m always cold. Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I\n        love spider burners.",
        "Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much. (runs over and hugs\n        him)",
        "Did you just smell my hair?",
        "Oh God.",
        "You still have feelings for me don’t you?",
        "Pete.",
        "No, it’s not bad. It’s not bad at all. It’s-it’s really nice.",
        "You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with\n        being the one who hurts you. That’s why I can’t take this job.",
        "And well, we probably shouldn’t see each other anymore. I’m\n        sorry.",
        "Okay, bye. ",
        "All right shut up for a second and let me just see something.\n        (She kisses him back on the lips) Oh, wow! (They then hug and\n        kiss, very passionately.)",
        "Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?",
        "(Entering from her bedroom, talking on the phone) Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. (To the gang) I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.",
        "Sixty guests.",
        "Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.",
        "I don't know.",
        "Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.",
        "Well, you're not working either.",
        "Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you!",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow--the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!",
        "Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. (Picks up two frying pans) Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!",
        "Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look--I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh, is everything in the car?",
        "No. I hate this part.",
        "No, that's not mine.",
        "Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.",
        "Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...",
        "Just the matter of ...payment?",
        "Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.",
        "What?",
        "Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?",
        "Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.",
        "Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!",
        "I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.",
        "Oh, that's great! Congratulations!",
        "Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.",
        "And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.",
        "Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!",
        "I can cook and you can take care of the money.",
        "Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister.",
        "Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?",
        "No?",
        "Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.",
        "He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, \"The Sound.\"",
        "Yeah!",
        "(At a loss for words) Boy, that was-that was, umm… terrific.",
        "Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!",
        "(to Rachel and Phoebe) Y'know, there’s a Starbucks about three blocks down.",
        "(to Phoebe) Hey, aren’t you up next?",
        "Phoebe, Ross sucks!",
        "Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.",
        "Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!",
        "Are you serious?",
        "You obviously haven’t screwed over a lot of your friends. (They all look at her) Which we all appreciate.",
        "He loves you.",
        "I remember you did.",
        "(removing ear plugs) What?",
        "Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.",
        "Come on, no peeking! (They are leading the gang out with there hands over their eyes.)",
        "All right, umm, we’re not gonna really keep it this way though.",
        "(to Phoebe) Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?",
        "Well, I’m gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.",
        "Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence… dozens of people.",
        "Oh no-no-no, it’s only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.",
        "Oh.",
        "All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?",
        "Hey! My first review is out!",
        "All right, look at my on the back page.",
        "Hey, they don’t pay me a penny a word to make friends.",
        "Oh! Do you need me to go with you?",
        "Haven’t we made this decision?",
        "Bye!",
        "(answering it) Who is it?",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Oh my God, oh my God. (on intercom) Call me on the phone!",
        "Look, I-I’m never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.",
        "No! Phoebe!",
        "I couldn’t eat it! I had five friends who couldn’t eat it, and one of them eats books.",
        "The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!",
        "All right, that I’ll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn’t it. You’re marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.",
        "Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?",
        "Hand me those tomatoes, I’m gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.",
        "Okay, the owner of Allesandro’s came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!",
        "Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!",
        "You got the job?! Why didn’t you tell me?",
        "Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. (Rachel excuses herself) Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.",
        "I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it’s snowballing, y’know?",
        "I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro’s.",
        "It’s okay, ‘cause y'know what? You don’t really need me for the business.",
        "All right. But umm, I-I-I’ll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.",
        "Phoebe, wait a minute! (runs after her, leaving Rachel alone)",
        "(entering) Ohh, here you are. Y’know, I’m-I’m glad you decided to hear me out.",
        "I’ve been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.",
        "Or! A bakery delivery person.",
        "Pizza?!",
        "All right, I’ve got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I’m getting the feeling that you don’t want to deliver.",
        "Okay. I’m guessing that if you don’t want to deliver, you probably don’t want to pick stuff up either.",
        "Y’know what, let’s do the catering business.",
        "Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y’know what, it’d be, it’d be fun.",
        "Really?!",
        "Thank you.",
        " Umm, I just wanna say, uh (reads from a 3 X 5 card) that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... (Looks up and sees eveyone glaring at her) Are you gonna kill me?",
        "Boy, you are really not a morning person.",
        "What kind of changes?",
        "Oh, good luck.",
        "That is sooo not true!",
        "I just—I can’t believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Deal!",
        "Ha-ha!",
        "Aww, man!",
        "That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.",
        "Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.",
        "Are you scared?",
        "Ross will do it.",
        "You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?",
        "Same category?",
        "Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!",
        "No!!",
        "I knew that! Rachel! Use you’re head!",
        "Viva Las Gaygas!",
        "You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds.",
        "Huh, wanna bet?",
        "How about we play for more money, say 150?",
        "You’re doing it again.",
        "We won’t. (to Chandler) 300?",
        "I’m just trying to spice it up!",
        "I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?",
        "Deal!",
        "Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand. (Holds up her hand.)",
        "No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.",
        "Come on!",
        "Come on!",
        "Sandwiches!",
        "Maurice.",
        "And processing.",
        "It’s umm, it has something to do with transponding.",
        "That’s not even a word! I can get this! I can get this!",
        "NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!",
        "Man, I feel like I’m coming down with something.",
        "Yeah. (to Chandler) I bet you can’t guess what color my tonsils are? I’ll bet the apartment!",
        "How do you feel?",
        "Really?! How much?!",
        "Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would’ve made them get rid of the birds. Right?",
        "All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it’s all your fault.",
        "Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!",
        "Well?",
        "It’s only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time.",
        "Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?",
        "I’ll take care of it.",
        "I lost our mattresses.",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey, don’t mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.",
        "Hey, we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question wrong!",
        "I can’t find garbage bags!",
        "What is it?!",
        "I can’t believe we’re living here!",
        "No, you've messed it up. You're stupid.",
        "Are you serious?",
        "What did you tell them?",
        "Yeah, I mean you'd be pregnant. I mean, pregnant.",
        "We just want you to think it through.",
        "In the beginning, you know, where it's all s*x and talking and s*x and talking...",
        "And the s*x?",
        "Then what is it?",
        "Big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends. That doesn't mean he's good in bed.",
        "Sweetie, with you it's going to be different. The s*x is going to be great 'cause you guys are in love.",
        "I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me. [Rachel puts her arm consolingly around Monica]",
        "What?",
        "[to Chandler] So, did you do it?",
        "Uh-oh, was it bad?",
        "Well, it was the first time. You know, there's not always a lot of agreement on the first time.",
        "All right, I'm going to show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, hand me that pad over there. [Rach gets a pad and pen off the table and hands it to Monica.] All right. Now...[starts to draw]",
        "Now, everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got, [starts labelling her diagram] one, two, three, [Chandler nods impatiently], four [now Chandle looks up, surprised], five, six, and seven.",
        "[chuckles] Kind of an important one.",
        "Okay, now, most guys will hit one, two, and three and then go to seven and set up camp.",
        "All right, uh the important thing is to take your time. You want to hit them all and you want to mix them up. You got to keep them on their toes.",
        "Okay, you could, uh, start with a little one; a two; a one, two, three; a three; a five; a four, a three-two; a two, a two-four-six; [Monica starts to get into it ] two-four-six; four [Rachel kind of moves back and stretches out] a two; [Monica now has her eyes closed and is getting visibly excited] two; four-seven; five-seven [Chandler looks away from both of them as if he can't believe what's happening]; six-seven; seven, seven, [faster] SEVEN, SEVEN, SEVEN-SEVEN-SEVEN-SEVEN-[Chandler looks at her in disbelief] SEVEN-SEVEN! [Monica, eyes still closed, leans back and shudders and says silently, while holding up seven fingers, \"seven\".]",
        "You know, I never saw that.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "[to Phoebe] It's going to be so great.",
        "Would you surrogate?",
        "What if I asked?",
        "Really?",
        "No.",
        "Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.",
        "I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this (puts on her chef hat) on my chef’s hat. (The hat says ‘Quit, bitch’)",
        "I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me. (Joey laughs and Monica glares at him.)",
        "I mean they’re trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I’ve been waiting for my whole life.",
        "I would love too, but I can’t! I mean I just can’t, you know that I’m not good at confrontation.",
        "That’s a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?",
        "All right, you’re hired!",
        "Didn’t your dad used to call you Pumpkin?",
        "(getting up) All right, I’m gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?",
        "You want a problem? I’ll give you a problem!",
        "You bet your ass, I’m gonna fire you! Thank you.",
        "Hey.",
        "They baked it. I can’t take this anymore. I’m gonna call a meeting tonight, I’m gonna fire you tonight.",
        "What are you doing?!",
        "Thanks. (Joey’s still patting the burn spot) I think you got it!",
        "Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?",
        "Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight’s specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag—Why is nobody writing these down?",
        "Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?",
        "Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here’s the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, (quietly) tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere…",
        "(louder) A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. (She holds her hand over her head as an afterthought.) From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! (Joey looks at the money he’s holding, and doesn’t speak up.) Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!",
        "What the hell happened?!",
        "Joey, we had a deal. That-that’s why you’re here! I’ve got to fire you!",
        "What kinda things have you been saying?",
        "I need more swordfish. (to one of the assistant chefs) Can you get me some more swordfish?",
        "You did a minute ago!",
        "Fine!",
        "Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I’m cold! (She spills something.) And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out! (the door opens)",
        "That’s not funny.",
        "(starting to cry) I’m a good person. And I’m a good chef, and I don’t deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y’know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is…",
        "You do?",
        "Well if you want a problem? I’ll give you a problem!",
        "You bet your ass I’m gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!! (Joey leaves) All right! Anybody else got a problem? How ‘bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?",
        "How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it’s funny now?",
        "Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, (to the kitchen worker from earlier) And you! Get the swordfish! (to another assistant chef) And you! Get a haircut!",
        "Thanks.",
        "Enough!",
        "Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?",
        "Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just…(Rachel grunts and throws her purse at it)…throw your purses at it.",
        "Oh my God, are you out of a job?",
        "Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can’t eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.",
        "If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that’s your department now. (She takes back the turkey leg)",
        "What are you doing?",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "You made pancakes?",
        "Okay. (She does so and starts to walk towards Joey to receive her pancakes.)",
        "Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.",
        "The players.",
        "(laughs) Please, it’s a relief is what it is, is what it is.",
        "Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!",
        "Please, have some!",
        "Yeah, I’ve just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.",
        "Yeah, it’s just something I picked up.",
        "Wait! Wait! This isn’t take-out!",
        "No, wait, please don’t go! I’ve got p0rn for you too!",
        "People are supposed to wanna hang out here!",
        "I’m the hostess! Not those guys! I’m always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.",
        "‘Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I’m-I’m done now. They’ve suffered enough.",
        "All right then, when I’m done with this place, it’s gonna be ten times better than that place!",
        "Are you sure?",
        "Nah, I got it.",
        "(entering) Okay, it’s ready. Come on.",
        "Just come.",
        "Pretty much. (to Joey) So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?",
        "You used to have carpet.",
        "So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I’m just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.",
        "Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I’m always the hostess.",
        "We haven’t eaten yet!",
        "Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.",
        "Who cares? He works in a museum!",
        "What is wrong with this freezer?! (She jabs her arm into the freezer and a piece of ice flies into her eye.) Ow! Ow!!",
        "Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!",
        "Oh, y’know what, I can’t, it really kills.",
        "No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can’t go to him when I don’t have a boyfriend!",
        "Like I remember his office number! (Pause) Speed dial 7.",
        "Yes!!",
        "Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?",
        "Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.",
        "I was probably waiting for it to open.",
        "You look great too.",
        "So how does it look?",
        "Like a pirate?!",
        "Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? (He looks at her) Come on, one of us had to mention him.",
        "Oh. Big family dinner tonight?",
        "No way!",
        "(disappointed) Oh.",
        "(happy) Oh.",
        "(sympathetic) Oh. (in a pirate’s voice) So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?",
        "I know.",
        "Why is it sick?",
        "Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don’t you?",
        "Me going out with Richard’s son.",
        "Fine! Judge all you want to but, (points to Ross) married a lesbian, (points to Rachel) left a man at the altar, (points to Phoebe) fell in love with a gay ice dancer, (points to Joey) threw a girl’s wooden leg in a fire, (points to Chandler) livin’ in a box!! (goes to her room)",
        "(running in from her bedroom) I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! (opens the door) Hi, Tim.",
        "Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.",
        "And Joey.",
        "My brother, Ross.",
        "And Rachel. (Chandler clears his voice loudly) And that’s Chandler.",
        "Umm, well, he’s…",
        "All right everybody, this turkey is ready!",
        "Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.",
        "See he’s nice. Right?",
        "I saved you a seat. (Motions to the one next to her.)",
        "Oh-ho-ho, we’ve got company.",
        "(putting off her coat) Ooh, this always happens. (Her coat gets stuck.)",
        "Thank you.",
        "Y’know all my friends think this is weird.",
        "I know! I mean it’s like me and your dad, that’s a totally separate thing.",
        "We’re just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?",
        "Nothing. Nothing.",
        "No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss…",
        "(interrupting) Don’t say it!",
        "Yeah!",
        "I know!",
        "Oh, he’s catching up to her!",
        "Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?",
        "Didn’t it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?",
        "They wouldn’t have put it there if it didn’t do something! How can you not care?",
        "Janice?!",
        "How have you been?",
        "Done?",
        "This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don’t work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.",
        "Yeah, well, I’m using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. (She flips on the switch and a hum starts.) I hear something! I hear something! Where is it? (They all start looking until Rachel realises it’s Joey.)",
        "He asked you out?!",
        "Saucy!",
        "Electrical plans for the building.",
        "I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they’d brighten up the place. They do don’t you think?",
        "No-no-no, no!",
        "I know that there’s no hole there, I just really liked that picture.",
        "Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!",
        "I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.",
        "No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.",
        "But it didn’t. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.",
        "All right. The super couldn’t figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn’t figure out what it did. I’ve had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.",
        "I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.",
        "What is it hon?",
        "Aww, honey I’m sorry.",
        "I don’t know how museums work in England but, here, you’re not supposed to take stuff.",
        "Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.",
        "You changed?",
        "And lucky means, more cleavage?",
        "Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.",
        "Or Spin the Bottle?",
        "Two in a row! You’ve got to use your tongues now! (They kiss again.)",
        "Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?",
        "Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can’t let—(pause), actually I kinda want to see what happens.",
        "Are you all right?",
        "I think you’re done.",
        "(not wanting to be left out, picks up something) Hey umm, what’s this?",
        "Hey, Joey, I don’t think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it’s only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?",
        "What’s Phase Two?",
        "You stink!",
        "Uh-oh, what’s the matter?",
        "I don’t know sweetie.",
        "I can’t! I have to work!",
        "No, Chandler’s still in Phase One, and Joey’s that thing you smell.",
        "I think she’s here.",
        "(looking out the peephole) Ohh, she’s looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can’t see people through that little hole, can you? (Goes back to the door.) Hello!",
        "I-I-I think you look great.",
        "What?",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Oh wait, Joey, you can’t go like that! You stink!",
        "Yeah. Run ten blocks, that’ll help the smell.",
        "So? How did it go with Joshua last night?",
        "What?",
        "So you hit her in the face?",
        "Hey! You’re wearing pants!",
        "It’s 9:30 in the morning!",
        "Hello. (Listens) Oh, hey Ross!",
        "Oh-oh, my God!",
        "(to Chandler) Shh!! (On phone) Wait, what?",
        "He’s with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!",
        "He had to go, there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.",
        "Why do you care so much anyway?",
        "Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.",
        "A couple of days.",
        "What are you doing?! Chandler! You can’t just go back a phase!",
        "Yeah, come on, we can be guys!",
        "(coming back to the stage and sitting next to Chandler) Okay, I’ve got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?",
        "Very good, (getting up and sliding a One into the dancer’s hot pants) so good.",
        "(to the waitress) When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.",
        "Oh! And don’t let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.",
        "I think somebody needs another lap dance. (Motions for one.)",
        "So, we did okay at the strip club, right?",
        "What, he doesn’t like Josh?",
        "Yeah. And y’know, if you wanna cry, that’s okay too.",
        "Come on! Chandler!",
        "They really were pretty, weren’t they? (Rachel and Phoebe both agree)",
        "Oh, Candy! She was so spunky!",
        "Y’know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. (Chandler is intrigued.) It’d, it’d be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.",
        "Oh, Chantal!",
        "Really?!",
        "That’s-that’s not Phase Three.",
        "Hey!",
        "Wait, now, what am I doing again?",
        "Well at least, I’m going to mute it.",
        "Hi!",
        "Okay.",
        "Hi.",
        "Oh. Why didn’t you take her?",
        "You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free p0rn!",
        "Hey, cheer up! You’re gonna see her again, right?",
        "(interrupting him) No-no-no, don’t-don’t do the accent. You’ve got to see her again.",
        "Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!",
        "No! Y’know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.",
        "Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!",
        "Do you love her?",
        "You love her!",
        "Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You’re probably just gonna catch her just as she’s about to go to the gate. You’re gonna call out her name and say, \"I love you!\" And she’s gonna say, \"I love you, too!\" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.",
        "Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in… (Ross looks at her.) I’ve been watching too much p0rn.",
        "Where ya going?",
        "How did it go with Frank and Alice?",
        "Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?",
        "And well, what did she say?",
        "Oh, you’re totally welcome! What’d she say?",
        "It is not over! You’re over!",
        "You know!",
        "It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn’t, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go! (Tries to push Ross out the door.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Phoebe, they didn’t make you pay for those knives, did they?",
        "Are you sure?",
        "This isn’t how it’s supposed to go, there can’t be another guy.",
        "Of course there’s another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!",
        "You have to go to London!",
        "Yeah, you have to go fight for her!",
        "When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?",
        "You sat back and let him have her, you didn’t fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?",
        "All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! (Points to the TV.) That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!",
        "Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don’t let her go without a fight!",
        "All right.",
        "Okay, good luck!",
        "That’s sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?",
        "Hello.",
        "Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?",
        "All right. When is, when is the next flight out?",
        "Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn’t show up by then, then just come on home.",
        "What are you doing here? You can’t be here!",
        "Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! (Points at Chandler) I was right! (Points to Emily) I’m right, right?",
        "Oh.",
        "Hey.",
        "I know. How could we have let this happen?",
        "Ugh! Well, y’know, we were away…",
        "I blame London.",
        "So look umm, while we’re st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?",
        "Only here.",
        "I’ll meet you there in two minutes.",
        "(impatiently) Now?",
        "Oh, I-I don’t know.",
        "Just uh, do the right thing. (Uses some breath spray)",
        "Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box! (Tries to leave, but is stopped by Rachel.)",
        "Wait. Rachel, no, he’s married. Married! If you don’t realize that, I can’t help you.",
        "Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?",
        "Why?!",
        "Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn’t eat meat until she has the babies!",
        "That’s true.",
        "Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!",
        "Yes, I want to change. And why-why don’t you go down and get us a table?",
        "(elbows him) Fifteen minutes.",
        "Great…",
        "But my clothes are—ohh! (They both leave.)",
        "No time for that!",
        "Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It’s My Giant!",
        "You really think this is okay?",
        "Oh, it’s so beautiful. Ohh! Y’know, I-I don’t know if I feel right about this.",
        "Okay!",
        "You didn’t find her?",
        "Yeah, I think you should keep looking!",
        "Or 45.",
        "Well, it’s getting late.",
        "Ugh, y’know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.",
        "I know, I’ve been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don’t you think?",
        "Y’know, maybe it’s best that we never got to do it again.",
        "I’m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I’ll see you there in a bit?",
        "I know!",
        "Phoebe, I did not have s*x.",
        "Well, we certainly are alone.",
        "Right. Umm, listen since we’re-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross’s mother…",
        "Well, an-anyway, I just—that night meant a lot to me, I guess I’m just trying to say thanks.",
        "(laughs) That’s okay.",
        "And you’re cute too.",
        "Okay.",
        "That counts!",
        "Y’know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people’s s*x clothes.",
        "Um-hmm.",
        "Well, you’re making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.",
        "Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you (Points at Rachel) bitched about it, then you (Points to herself) would stop cooking, and you (Points at Rachel) would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.",
        "So, you wore your nightie to dinner?",
        "Oh, no!",
        "Emily’s straight.",
        "This totally makes sense!",
        "Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren’t jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!",
        "This is so much fun!",
        "Look, all we’re trying to say is, don’t let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.",
        "Chandler, that’s like your fourth cup of coffee!",
        "He’s in a different room! He’s really that loud?",
        "Y’know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over…",
        "He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.",
        "Have you guys picked a date yet?",
        "Ugh, she’s upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya something! I’m not doing them this time! I don’t care if those dishes sit in the sink until they’re all covered with—I’ll do them when I get home!",
        "I’ll pick it up for you!",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh my God! Ohh! Look at this one! It’s so beautiful!",
        "Oh, yes, umm, I’m here to pick up a dress that you have on hold.",
        "Emily Waltham.",
        "(laughs) Okay.",
        "I am, aren’t I?",
        "Yes?",
        "All right. (Goes to take off the dress.)",
        "Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I believe she does. (Looks at the wedding dress and stops.)",
        "Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming. (There’s a knock on the door.) Uh, just a second!",
        "Phoebe?",
        "Can you just hold on for one minute?",
        "Are you alone?",
        "All right.",
        "Okay, ready?",
        "Okay.",
        "Congratulations!",
        "Okay! My turn! My turn!",
        "(cocking her head from side to side in some pre-bouquet-catching ritual) Yeah.",
        "(upset) That was a terrible throw!!",
        "Look at me! My big concern is what’s real?! (Finally realises) Oh my God. We’re really sad, aren’t we?",
        "This isn’t even my dress.",
        "I’m changing out of this.",
        "In like a half-hour?",
        "Okay, throw it straight this time.",
        "I’m getting married next!!",
        "Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn’t you start feeling silly?",
        "Oh God.",
        "Hey!",
        "So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?",
        "No, seriously.",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? ‘Cause I don’t think you have to wear it unless you are!",
        "Ohh, sweetie! (Goes to comfort her.) Hey, I bet you anything that he’s gonna call you again.",
        "Again. Y’know what? I think we all did.",
        "Hey! (She jumps up and throws Emily’s wedding dress into Rachel’s room.)",
        "Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. (Pause) Maybe someday, there will be.",
        "Oh God! He’s gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!",
        "No-no, Rachel, don’t get it! He can’t see us!",
        "Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.",
        "Oh man! I did it again!",
        "What?",
        "That's what it sounded like.",
        "Umm. (Looks at Chandler who is using the phone.) Umm. Umm. I don't think so.",
        "Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.",
        "Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?",
        "Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.",
        "Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.",
        "Feeling a little better sweetie?",
        "Me too.",
        "(entering with Chandler) Hey!",
        "(To Phoebe) How are you doing?",
        "Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!",
        "Chandler!",
        "So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?",
        "Oh, great!",
        "Bye Dan!",
        "Great!",
        "Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.",
        "I think you're better than you think you are.",
        "(interrupting) Know when to stop.",
        "Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. (They kiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts to dance. Without turning around.) Don't do the dance.",
        "I think you're my favorite.",
        "I don't care.",
        "Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!",
        "Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.",
        "Y’know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!",
        "Okay.",
        "Shut up! This place is a hole!",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?",
        "Yeah, apparently, they’re pretty good seats.",
        "Yeah, what, do you think we’re stupid?",
        "What do you say?",
        "Have you even had a girl up here?",
        "(entering with Rachel) All right boys, last chance for the tickets!",
        "All right, so what do you say?",
        "Oh, just do it!!",
        "They’re green?",
        "That’s not even a game!",
        "You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?",
        "Oh, good.",
        "Okay. (She picks a card.) Four.",
        "Because we won our apartment back!",
        "No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!",
        "But, we pick again! We pick again!",
        "I don’t know!",
        "We’ll discuss it, in the morning! (Slams the door shut.)",
        "No, we’re not! We’re not leaving!",
        "As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.",
        "Men are such idiots.",
        "Yeah, let-let-let’s pretend that’s not true.",
        "What-what’s going on?",
        "When, when did—how, how did you…",
        "(to Ross) I can’t believe you’re getting married!",
        "You look cute in bubbles.",
        "Chicken? I could eat some chicken.",
        "Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?",
        "Bodington's!",
        "Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, (Checks watch) she should be here by now.",
        "No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.",
        "Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!",

        "(Interrupting) Oh, what about that guy over there? (She points at another guy and Gunther is deflated.) Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.",
        "You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.",
        "We got out pictures back from London. (Shows her one.) Here's all of us at the Tower of London.",
        "What happened?",
        "See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!",
        "What took you so long?",
        "Oh, good.",
        "Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.",
        "(Poking her head in) Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.",
        "What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!",
        "I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?",
        "(Gasps) What?!! You cannot tell him that!!",
        "I make the decisions, and I say no.",

        "Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?",
        "Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might (Turns to look at Ross) end up hurting.",
        "All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.",

        "Come on Rach, let's go.",
        "No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.",
        "Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?",
        "Okay. I-I can't watch. (Leaves as sits down to read the paper.)",
        "Oh my God! You're water broke!",
        "I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!",

        "That's all right.",
        "Rachel?!",
        "Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (TO RACHEL) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? ",
        "Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can’t believe my brother’s getting married! And in London! It’s so romantic!",
        "Hey!",
        "I never knew that either.",
        "We’re hanging out.",
        "I’m sorry honey.",
        "Rach, you’re gonna come though aren’t you?",
        "You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren’t there. Just say you’ll think about it, okay?",
        "I can't believe he did this.",
        "You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.",
        "Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.",
        "Oh, dad, turn it off.",
        "If you're not going then I don't want to go either.",
        "I can't believe you did that.",
        "(seeing the decision) Nooooo. You’re really not going?",
        "You don’t have a car. And your license expired.",
        "Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!! (She runs back to her apartment.)",
        "Passport, check! (As she puts away each item, she says check.) Camera, check! Traveller’s cheques, check!",
        "Myself. Y’know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check! (pause) My mom does it, I never realized it was weird.",
        "Hey!",
        "Yep! You got the tickets?",
        "Okay, if you need the vacuum, it’s in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator…",
        "Yeah, okay, give that a try!",
        "All right, y’know what? We really are late! Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go!!",
        "Chicken Kiev?",
        "Yeah, y’know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn’t have to worry about the salmonella. (Ross pushes her.) So, I can’t wait to see this place you’re getting married!",
        "It’s nice.",
        "(entering) Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened.",
        "They torn it down a few days early.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Hey!",
        "(laughs) Yes, I did! And you are welcome!",
        "Umm…",
        "She said that?!",
        "Why?!",
        "Oh my God. You’re even dumber than I am!",
        "Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?",
        "Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That’s what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake (Starting to cry), with the little people on top. (Ross gets thrown a box of Kleenex from the bathroom and he gives her one.) Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.",
        "Sometimes we were.",
        "Okay.",
        "You’ll see.",
        "And the musicians, look, they can go over here (Points to a little alcove), okay? And the chairs can face this way (Points), and… (Points to Ross) You go.",
        "Ohh. And I don’t even have a date.",
        "Hey.",
        "Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!",
        "Ha ha, a joke that’s funny in all countries.",
        "(Looking nauseous from her parents kissing.) And I’m going to go get drunk. (Gets up to get a drink.)",
        "I was laughing. (Patting him on the knee.)",
        "Well I didn’t want everyone to think I was stupid.",
        "My mother’s driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. I’m happy. (A drunken man approaches.) I’m not going to let anything spoil that.",
        "Well, thanks, we like him.",
        "Then why would he say it?",
        "Oh, my mother’s right. I’m never going to get married.",
        "Ohh, Please?! I’m a single mom, with a thirty year old son!!",
        "(Comes up for below the covers and looks concerned.) Do you think he knew I was here? (Chandler quickly looks at Monica not knowing what to say.)",
        "(In am uneasy voice.) Nope. (She chuckles uneasily.)",
        "Yep, yep...You?",
        "Well...I’d better get going.",
        "(Scoots towards the side of the bed.) Could you not look?",
        "Well, I love it. I only hope my wedding looks this good.",
        "(Angrily.) You can let some of them go by!(Judy and Andrea go to the front of the chapel. Joey approaches Monica.)",
        "(Awkwardly.) Why would I care where Chandler is? You know uhh...You know sometimes I don’t even like Chandler.",
        "Stupid.",
        "What were we thinking?",
        "Oh yeah. Definitely.",
        "That’s also like the tenth time you told us.",
        "What?",
        "I thought that was a good thing.",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah, there’s one right under the cabinet.",

        "What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come you’re having a party and we’re not invited?",
        "Sooo?",
        "Nooo!",
        "The baby shower for Phoebe!",
        "Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! (She shows Rachel what she bought. She bought a little leather jacket and a little cowboy outfit for the babies.) Can you believe they make these for little people?",
        "Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite. (It’s a little pink and white dress for the girl baby.)",
        "I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!",
        "Because she’s not gonna get to keep the babies.",
        "Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she’s done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.",
        "Oh, she’s gonna love that!",
        "Hi Phoebe.",
        "Hormones.",
        "Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That’s great. So how-how are things going?",
        "Here’s your tea Phoebe. (They give it to her and quickly take a step back.)",
        "I’m so glad you liked it.",
        "What?!",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Wait, you can’t have the baby here! I mean I haven’t sterilised it since the guys moved out!",
        "Rachel, get the book! The book!",
        "The Bible?!",
        "How do you feel?",
        "Some moms do that.",
        "Aww, sweetie, but it’s not like you’re not gonna have anything. You’re gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that’s even better.",
        "I mean, you’re the one they’re gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about s*x.",
        "Yeah.",

        "No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.",
        "Her answer machine?",
        "Duh, where've you been?",
        "Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!",
        "Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.",
        "Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.",
        "Maybe she never got your message.",
        "He's back! The peeper's back!",
        "(DUCKING) Get down!",
        "(INTRIGUED) Yeah?",
        "..Naughty!",
        "Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- (EXIT RACHEL, SLAMMING DOOR IN HIS FACE) That's fine, yeah...",
        "(WATCHES THEM FOR A WHILE) Oh my.",
        "Hey, you know our phone's not working?",
        "I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.",
        "Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?",
        "(TO MONICA) Can I use your phone? (ON PHONE) Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.",
        "Yeah, is Sidney there? Oh, this is? (TO THE GANG) Sidney's a woman.",
        "Yeah. Yeah, so what? (TO PHONE) Look, I live across the street, (WALKING TO WINDOW) and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? Yeah, I can see you right now! Hello! If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like- Thank you, but... that's not really the point... The point is that... mostly free weights, but occasionally..",
        "(STILL ON PHONE) Yeah, my neighbour... Yeah, the brunette... (TO MONICA) She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.",
        "Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.",
        "Big day.",
        "All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...",
        "That's nice.",
        "Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.",
        "He should take the sack?",
        "Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking. Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?",
        "I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.",
        "When's that?",
        "Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?",
        "What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.",
        "Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?",
        "Hey.",
        "Your sister stood me up the other night.",
        "I've been trying for two days. When I call the restaurant, they say she's too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off.",
        "Urs, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you.",
        "No, no, no, don't say \"listen\". I know that \"listen\". I've said that \"listen\".",
        "I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?",
        "You don't drink",
        "Urs--",
        "Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?",
        "No. No, I, I couldn't do that.",
        "Then, uh, then I'm sorry.",
        "I know. I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or what, but you have never looked so beautiful.",
        "Pheebs?",
        "We just got the message.",
        "Exellent dream score.",
        "I donīt know. What are you wearing?",
        "Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.",
        "What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?",
        "How young is young Ethan? Young?",
        "Whoa!",
        "Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesnīt mean...",
        "All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.",
        "Services? Oh, services.",
        "Hey, hey. How was the first day?",
        "Oh... Yeah, you do.",
        "[reaches for hi scones] My scones.",
        "All right.",
        "So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?",
        "What?",
        "Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest \"Power Ranger\" is?",
        "Stegosaurus!",
        "What about André?",
        "Theyīre here allready?",
        "Uh, moist, yeah.",
        "All right, all right. [he comes out from their apartment with a huge sandwich in his hand]",
        "For the ride.",
        "All rihgt, Iīm going. Iīm going.",
        "Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.",
        "I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.",
        "Well... I'm helping out down at the NYU Med School with some... research.",
        "Oh, just, y'know.... science.",
        "[sigh]... It's a fertility study.",
        "Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.",
        "We make fire. Cook meat.",
        "Oh, OK.",
        "I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.",
        "What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?",
        "Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have s*x with me.",
        "Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.",
        "Hey!",
        "The country?",
        "Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?",
        "He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.",
        "Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.",
        "We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man. [Joey gives Ross a hug]",
        "Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.",
        "Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I--",
        "Then you do. Heh, heh.",
        "What do you mean?",
        "Not following you.",
        "[to Rachel]: That book got me through some tough times.",
        "[pats Chandler on the leg] That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.",
        "Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.",
        "The country.",
        "He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.",
        "Heh, heh. It was nothin'.",
        "[panicked] Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.",
        "Sure! Why not?",
        "How do you mean?",
        "Shhhh!",
        "She's still asleep.",
        "Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?",
        "Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!",
        "It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.",
        "I know! Neither did I!",
        "Seven hundred bucks!",
        "Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.",
        "What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? [Joey closes his eyes and walks around with arms spread.]",
        "Do we have to know about that?",
        "I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.",
        "[to the screen] Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "Hey, listen, lady....[sees that she's pregnant]...whoa.",
        "Oh yeah? And who do you like?",
        "The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?",
        "Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!",
        "Oh, oh, oh, sorry.",
        "Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin' in here.",
        "Tribbiani.",
        "[takes phone] Hi, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends. [pause] Yeah, I'm single. [pause] 25. An actor. [pause] Hello?",
        "Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?",
        "Ok, look, maybe I should just go.",
        "Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?",
        "You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.",
        "Oh, it is.",
        "It is.",
        "Ew! What is that? Something exploded!",
        "[panicked] Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?",
        "Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's-- [notices the nurse looking at him strangely] I was just--yeah, right. Push! Push!",
        "Oh, just had a baby.",
        "Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.",
        "Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.",
        "He doesn't do much, does he?",
        "Um, this?",
        "Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie.",
        "Needs some clothes altered?",
        "Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?",
        "You know, I think I was sixteen.",
        "No no no no no, I'm not fallin' for that again.",
        "Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?",
        "Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey says hello. He'll know what it means.",
        "Can we see her?",
        "How're you doing?",
        "Ooh, that bad, huh? Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.",
        "You gotta tell Ross how you feel.",
        "What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.",
        "Look, Rache, Rache, I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.",
        "Frankie? What're you talking about?",
        "No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.",
        "That's how they do pants. First they go up one side, they move it over, they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?",
        "What? That's not? Oh my god.",
        "Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...",
        "I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.",
        "I gotta get one, too.",
        "Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.",
        "Uh, does it hurt?",
        "Chandler?",
        "Ok, I got one, I got one. If he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?",
        "Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?",
        "Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle.",
        "Who?",
        "What's he doin' in my section?",
        "Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'?",
        "Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.",
        "Yeah. Bijan for men?",
        "Bijan for men? Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work we could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.",
        "Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men?",
        "What is the big deal?",
        "Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh--",
        "Exactly.",
        "Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.",
        "Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.",
        "I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.",
        "Yeah I guess you're right.",
        "I'm gonna do it.",
        "Mornin'. I said, mornin'.",
        "Yeah, I'm ready.",
        "These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?",
        "Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.",
        "You guys are messin' with me, right?",
        "That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, \"whoa.\"",
        "\"Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!\"",
        "Such as?",
        "Check this out. Can I have this?",
        "Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.",
        "Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.",
        "\"Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school.",
        "That's what it says.",
        "What?",
        "So, you were both dorks. Big deal.",
        "Have you been here all night?",
        "Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.",
        "All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.",
        "Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.",
        "I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.",
        "Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?",
        "You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?",
        "Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.",
        "Geez, look how fat she got.",
        "Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?",
        "You want his yearbook?",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..",
        "Yes!",
        "Are you really not going?",
        "Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.",
        "No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.",
        "Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.",
        "It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.",
        "There's my scene, there's my scene. [Joey on tv] \"Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.",

        "Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?",
        "They didn't fight a lot?",
        "Hey, look who's up.",
        "I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!",
        "It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.",

        "Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?",
        "I'm him.",

        "Hey.",
        "C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.",
        "So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . .",
        "Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!",
        "Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.",
        "She told us.",
        "Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.",
        "Phoebe here with the cab yet?",
        "Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.",
        "Hey, here she comes.",
        "Hey.",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah, big stuff.",
        "Hey. [Phoebe takes off, Joey and Chandler are thrown back in the seat]",
        "Sure is.",
        "Good luck Phoebs.",
        "How far'd ya get?",
        "Phoebs, what's goin' on?",
        "Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.",
        "Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today.",
        "Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.",
        "Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas.",
        "Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?",
        "Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright.",
        "Rach, these are for you.",
        "No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.",
        "[Chandler and Joey give Monica a pack of condoms.]\nThey're ribbed for your pleasure.",
        "Do we need a cake?",
        "All right.",
        "Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.",
        "Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying \"let's go here, let's go there\". Like we can afford to go here and there.",
        "For Ross.",
        "Hi.",
        "If it's not you, this is a horrible story.",
        "Yeah, someplace nice. (to Phoebe and Rachel) How much do you think I can get for my kidney? (at Central Perk)",
        "Cool.",
        "Sorry, sorry.",
        "What are these, like famous chickens?",
        "Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?",
        "Thank you.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you.",
        "'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--",
        "Charity.",
        "Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.",
        "Me too.",
        "Fine.",
        "Come on you guys, one more time.",
        "Nooo.",
        "Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.",
        "You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?",
        "And we don't work hard?",
        "And you feel like we hold you back.",
        "Let me get that. (to Chandler) You got five bucks?",
        "Hey.",
        "Nice, nice. Hey I got somethin' for you. [hands Chandler an envelope.",
        "Eight hundred and twelve bucks.",
        "Well, I'm makin money now and this is payin' you back for head shots, electric bills, and so many slices of pizza I can't even count. I love ya man.",
        "Hey, this is a little extra somethin' for uh, ya know, always bein' there for me. [hands Chandler a jewelry box]",
        "Heh, what d'ya say?",
        "Isn't it? And it's engraved too, check it out.",
        "Put it on.",
        "Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything. [gets the bracelet from the drawer] You put this on, you're good to go. [puts the bracelet on Chandler] Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet.",
        "You have any idea what this'll do for your s*x life?",
        "If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.",
        "Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?",
        "You know what the. . . [sees Chandler on his knees, holding the couch cushions]",
        "Hey.",
        "How come you have two?",
        "Get out.",
        "Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.",
        "[pulls out a VCR tape] Hey Monica, what's on this video tape?",
        "What is with your nose?",
        "Some girl ate Monica.",
        "Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.",
        "Huh? So whaddya think? Casa de Joey. Huh? I decorated it myself.",
        "Art.",
        "Thanks, yeah. I love this but ya know what, it makes me wanna pee.",
        "Hey, how come, uhh, Chandler didn't come?",
        "Right, I go-, I got it.",
        "Yeah. Uh, oh, OH, the best part, c'mon. [leads them to the bathroom, gestures towards toilet, everyone stares, uncomprehending] Heh?",
        "No no no, behind it.",
        "That's right, I have a phone in here.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hello.",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, that's OK. You uh, you had a thing.",
        "Ahh, forget about it, I'm havin' a ball. How's the apartment doin'",
        "Oh, well great.",
        "Well OK then. [oven timer goes off behind Chandler] Was that the oven timer?",
        "Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?",
        "Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Blepe.",
        "Hey, hey, they're runnin'",
        "I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.",
        "You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad.",
        "Hey.",
        "You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes?",
        "Likewise. Uh, I'll take that. [grabs moose hat] It's what I came for. So, this is new. Where'd you two meet?",
        "Wow.",
        "Oh, now it's a spare room?",
        "Well I uh, got what I came for. [puts on moose hat] I'll uh, I'll see you guys.",
        "Yeah, yeah he is. [leaves]",
        "Eddie.",
        "Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. [looks for the mail on the table by the door, it's not there] Where's the mail?",
        "You don't keep it over here on this table any more?",
        "Huh.",
        "No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me.",
        "So how you two gettin' along?",
        "Great, well, I'm happy for ya. [picks up the orange juice carton and it's empty] Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice. There's no juice f or the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice.",
        "Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man.",
        "Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?",
        "Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.",
        "[sings] It may not be a bed of roses.",
        "Hey.",
        "Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?",
        "Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.",
        "Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache.",
        "Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee.",
        "Anybody want a croan.",
        "So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?",
        "No, can we get back to me?",
        "Alright. Cab driver number two?",
        "But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?",
        "But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.",
        "I'm sorry. See ya.",
        "What is it?",
        "See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.",
        "It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Look at this, how did I spend so much money?",
        "Ahh.",
        "My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do.",
        "What?",
        "That's a two line part.",
        "So what.",
        "Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.",
        "Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'",
        "Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.",
        "Look, I don't wanna hear this right now.",
        "Well don't just say.",
        "Ok.",
        "I don't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray. That was huge. Big things are gonna happen, you'll see. Ross, you still there?",
        "Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go.",
        "Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show.",
        "I fell down an elevator shaft.",
        "What?",
        "All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks.",
        "What?",
        "Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything. ",
        "And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.",
        "No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day. [gets up and leaves]",
        "Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose.",
        "They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.",
        "Thanks Ross.",
        "I went.",
        "I didn't get it.",
        "What?",
        "Huh?",
        "[movers removing a glass parrot] Oh, not my parrot.",
        "I can't watch this.",
        "Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register.",
        "Thanks Ross. I really like that bird though...I'll take the dog though.",
        "Hello.",
        "I know I would.",
        "Hey no problem.",
        "Na, na I'm ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is...",
        "A little foos?",
        "What happened to the foosball?",
        "He paid a lot of money for it.",
        "Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky.",
        "Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed.",
        "Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.",
        "Page 42, page 42, page 42.",
        "Ooh, I look good.",
        "Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'",
        "Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?",
        "I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?",
        "They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son.",
        "No. No way, I'm not signing that.",
        "How can they do this to me?",
        "I don't feel like talkin.",
        "Hey.",
        "I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out.",
        "Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin.",
        "Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.",
        "No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.",
        "No, that means nothin to me.",
        "Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?",
        "What?",
        "Yeah, so.",
        "Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.",
        "Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?",
        "Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.",
        "Hey.",
        "Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch.",
        "Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?",
        "So where you gettin' it?",
        "Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?",
        "Can you believe this place?",
        "Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.",
        "Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.",
        "Huh?",
        "Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?",
        "Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.",
        "Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.",
        "Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.",
        "I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.",
        "What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.",
        "Well that's how I feel.",
        "Well then maybe I will.",
        "Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.",
        "Hey.",
        "Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened. . .",
        "I know. Yeah.",
        "No, we're alright.",
        "Plastic spoons. Great.",
        "These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.",
        "Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.",
        "I'm movin' out like we talked about.",
        "Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.",
        "Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.",
        "Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?",
        "Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.",
        "Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.",
        "Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?",
        "Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it.",
        "Yes! And the table is mine.",
        "Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?",
        "Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.",
        "Naa, you keep it, you need the practice.",
        "So, I guess this is it.",
        "Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again.",
        "Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care.",
        "Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?",
        "Oh no, what happened?",
        "Yeah, I've had it.",
        "But don't you need experience for a job like that?",
        "Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.",
        "Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.",
        "Ha-ha. [Scott leaves] Are all you processors dorks?",
        "Hey.",
        "Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.",
        "Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.",
        "Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?",
        "I figure my character has kids.",
        "Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.",
        "Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.",
        "You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.",
        "Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.",
        "What a phony.",
        "Sir.",
        "Yeah Bing, what's that about?",
        "This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.",
        "Joseph's good, isn't he?",
        "Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.",
        "Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.",
        "Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.",
        "'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.",
        "Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.",
        "What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.",
        "Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.",
        "Karen.",
        "Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.",
        "Really?",
        "Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.",
        "It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot. [Chadler pushes him out the door by the face.]",
        "Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?",
        "Freaky.",
        "Monica, relax, go get a beer.",
        "Who said it was for you?",
        "You're kiddin'.",
        "Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.",
        "Do what?",
        "See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?",
        "Yeah good luck, good luck.",
        "Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich?",
        "Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo.",
        "Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?",
        "Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.",
        "Hey, hey, hey no.",
        "Well if he's not gonna eat it, I will.",
        "Phoebs, he's just a little dog. [turns back to the car window and the dog is halfway through it.] Ahhh.",
        "Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.",
        "Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?",
        "Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.",
        "Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'",
        "Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.",
        "How come those?",
        "That is so not my motto.",
        "Good.",
        "Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it.",
        "[dials the phone] It's a woman.",
        "[in a fake voice] Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye. [hangs up]",
        "[in the voice] Hard to say.",
        "[walks out of his room] Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.",
        "Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?",
        "By someone besides Monica?",
        "He-he-he, how's it goin'?",
        "Excellent.",
        "Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?",
        "Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.",
        "Cause she uh, she steals stuff.",
        "Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.",
        "I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.",
        "Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals.",
        "Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.",
        "Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.",
        "[peeks back out] Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, [sees that the coast is clear] oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.",
        "Right this is staging.",
        "[as they're walking out, Dr. Greene questioningly gestures at the Happy Birthday sign over the door] This is clearly in the wrong apartment. [they all walk across the hall]",
        "Quick volleyball question.",
        "Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?",
        "Ahh, you drive safe.",
        "Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. [grabs her and kisses her to distract her. She goes limp in his arms. Mr. Greene leaves.] Well, ok, you take care.",
        "Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.",
        "I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.",
        "Morning, hey, you made pancakes?",
        "(sarcastically) Good morning.",
        "(under his breath) Kiss her! Kiss her!",
        "B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.",
        "Come on, quite yankin' me.",
        "This is Janice.",
        "Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.",
        "(entering) Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.",
        "Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?",
        "There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?",
        "Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?",
        "Wheel!",
        "Fortune! This guy is so stupid. (yelling) It's Count Rushmore!!",
        "I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?",
        "Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.",
        "No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. (walks into the kitchen, Chandler follows closely, he turns around and gets startled). Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair (holds his hands up to signify she has big hair)?",
        "Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.",
        "Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?",
        "Look, what do you want me to say?",
        "I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna (grimaces and tenses up) pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.",
        "Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain? (Chandler gives him a look like 'You stupid idiot!')",
        "I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.",
        "And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...",
        "But what does that gonna do...",
        "Okay. I'm in.",
        "Does it have to be a whole day?",
        "Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy.",
        "I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.",
        "But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.",
        "No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.",
        "Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.",
        "Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.",
        "Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having s*x.",
        "Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over.",
        "Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.",
        "No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.",
        "Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?",
        "I don't know.",
        "How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?",
        "[Monica walks back in the kitchen] Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What's the matter with you, he's parking the car.",
        "Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. [With money in his palm] Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats [shakes his had and passes the dollar].",
        "No problem. Hey Chandler",
        "Ok.",
        "He-he-eyy. [Shakes his had and passes the dollar]",
        "Ok. He kept my dollar.",
        "How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?",
        "Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.",
        "Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks.",
        "Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.",
        "We're the guys.",
        "Man you are incredible.",
        "Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with.",
        "No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads. [Chandler starts kicking him below the table] I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here.",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "Nooooo.",
        "Not a dad.",
        "Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.",
        "All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.",
        "Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.",
        "No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.",
        "I did do it, I'm a professional.",
        "See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother. ",
        "Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.",
        "Come on, I need your help here.",
        "You see this, this is a friend.",
        "Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?",
        "Yeah, that makes sense. (looks at Ross)",
        "Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much. (Chandler ignores him) Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone.",
        "Aww, Rach, I think you look cute (kisses her on the cheek, then looks at Ross) And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon (goes to kiss him).",
        "Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him (runs out)",
        "(entering) Man, I got this close to him (holds up his fingers) and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on?",
        "Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.",
        "Aw, man I'm sorry (starts rubbing Chandler's shoulder). This must be very tough for ya, huh (and starts comfroting him looking for a kiss).",
        "Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....Hello? Hello? (picks up a statue of an Indian and walks into\nhis room)",
        "Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.\nEND",
        "Hey!",
        "No. Y'know how we’re always saying we need a place for the mail.",
        "Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.",
        "No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It’s a one day job, max.",
        "Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente’s.",
        "Power saw kinda got away from me there.",
        "Her what?",
        "Hey, Monica, who would yours be?",
        "It’s just a game Mon. (makes a ‘Can-you-believe-her’ face to the rest of the gang.) Rach, how about you?",
        "Hey-hey!",
        "I know.",
        "Oh, I’m sorry. Did I get ‘ya?",
        "Calm down, do you want this unit or not?",
        "Well, you should’ve told me that before, I’m not a mind reader. Hey, we’re out of beer. I’m going to Monica’s.",
        "Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.",
        "Nothing. It’s just old and dingy, that’s all.",
        "Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. (Monica gasps) Yeah.",
        "Relax. Here hold this (hands her his beer). This old stuff just comes right off. (he bends down to try and lift some tile right in the middle of the floor, in his tight pants.)",
        "(manages to pry off only a small piece) Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It’d take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it. (starts to walk away, but Monica grabs him)",
        "Eh! There you go.",
        "(yelling from bathroom) Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.",
        "Ooh, very official.",
        "Why don’t we just go on two.",
        "Because it’s faster.",
        "All right, but in the future...",
        "So we are going on two?",
        "Wow, it’s big!",
        "Maybe, my ruler’s wrong.",
        "Look it’s not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.",
        "Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.",
        "Y'know what?",
        "I bet ‘ya ya I could fit in there. (points to a hole in the center)",
        "Get out your checkbook, mister.",
        "You are dogged man! I totally fit!",
        "Thank you. Cha-ching! (Chandler starts to leave) Oh, well hello Mr. Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. (Chandler leaves and closes the door) And the drinks are on me!",
        "Question. Was ah, ‘Egg the Gellers!’ the war cry of your neighbourhood?",
        "Booo!!",
        "(entering) Hey, you guys!",
        "Guess what?",
        "I got a gig!",
        "Well, it’s not a part, no. I’m teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension.",
        "Yeah, yeah. It’s like my chance to give something back to the acting community.",
        "(glares at him) I know!",
        "Good evening. I’m Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as (proudly) Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, (looks for a reaction from his students, and gets none.) I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don’t have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this. (looks all intense for a moment and then gasps, the students cheer him) Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along.",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, ’Hey, the bell doesn’t dismiss you, I dismiss you.’",
        "Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children.",
        "Yeah, it’s this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I’m so, so right for it, y'know, he’s just like me. Except he’s a boxer, and has an evil twin.",
        "Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?",
        "You want me to lie to Chandler?",
        "No.",
        "Hey, you’re ah, pretty good at this.",
        "Ahh!",
        "Hey now!",
        "Hey!!! Oww!! And I’m bleeding.",
        "Okay, great.",
        "Okay.",
        "All right. I can’t see.",
        "Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I’ve never been able to cry as an actor, so if I’m in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let’s say I wanna convey that I’ve just done something evil. That would be the basic ‘I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it’ (Does it by raising one eyebrow, and showing off the pretend fishhook.) Okay, let’s say I’ve just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. (looks all confused) And that’s how it’s done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.",
        "Hey-hey.",
        "Awww, one of my students got an audition. I’m so proud.",
        "You bet! What’s the part?",
        "Wow! That was good. That was...(points to his pocket) Tweezers?",
        "Whoa. That was really good.",
        "Well, I-I might’ve said supergay.",
        "Because, Monica, the guy’s so good, and I really, really want this part.",
        "(sadly) There will come a time in each of your careers when you’ll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I’m ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he’s got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I’m stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. (he gets a huge round of applause from his students.) Thank you.",
        "All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.",
        "Oh-ho-kay, I’m talking to the king. (starts to go to a back room)",
        "You guys, can we please not watch this all right.",
        "(on tv) Oh, you said it Mike. (rips open the carton and spills\n      milk on the counter) Aw! There's got to be a better way!",
        "Can we please turn this off?",
        "(on TV, finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is\n      easy. (starts to poor the milk) Now, I can have milk everyday.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't\n      show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first\n      good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the\n      message?!",
        "How is it you?",
        "Yep, that's my audition.",
        "Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her\n      that I missed my chance.",
        "Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to\n      friends, she only talks to agents.",
        "What, what are you doing? What are you doing?",
        "Hang up, hang up. (reaches with his good arm, but Phoebe grabs\n      it and he tries to reach the phone with his other arm but can't\n      because of the sling.)",
        "I love that movie. (Joey is using it as a pillow)",
        "I'm sorry, it just felt nice.",
        "Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing\n      stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.",
        "Hey, you know about that?!",
        "Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I\n      understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than\n      one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much\n      like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of\n      heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of\n      bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of\n      commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed\n      guy there ever was.",
        "Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the\n      barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!",
        "Come on baby, come on!",
        "Thank you so much.",
        "You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see\n      there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and\n      Estelle couldn't get me in.",
        "Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's\n      two.",
        "Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at\n      it. I love you.",
        "Nooo, four.",
        "(entering) G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?",
        "Pheebs! There you are!",
        "But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe! (catches her in the\n      hallway)",
        "Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything?\n      I think I got a shot at it.",
        "It's okay, these things happen.",
        "I'm, I'm okay. See. (tries to smile, but fails horribly)",
        "No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had!\n      Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it\n      personally.",
        "They actually said that?",
        "No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents\n      always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went\n      another way', but this, I can use this. (in a very bad Italian\n      accent) I canna work on a new accent.",
        "Okay, shoot.",
        "I didn't get it?",
        "Okay, what else?",
        "Oh.",
        "Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really\n      appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to\n      Estelle.",
        "Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she\n      is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb\n      brains out.",
        "You do, thanks.",
        "Wait a minute.",
        "Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get\n      out of being my agent.",
        "(in a really, really bad Italian accent) That's-ah what I\n      suspected-ah.",
        "Well, that’s really a different question.",
        "Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.",
        "Okay, but let’s say there was. How might that go?",
        "Hey, there’s a dog out there!",
        "Don’t you ah, don’t you wanna ask me any questions?",
        "Well, ah, I’m an actor. I’m fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don’t worry I’m totally okay with the gay thing.",
        "Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I’m totally cool with that.",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey! (goes into the apartment)",
        "Oh, no thanks, I got it. (picks it up) No I don’t!",
        "Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.",
        "That’s a uh, that’s a tough combination.",
        "Like you wouldn’t believe. (they go into the apartment) Wow! This is a great place.",
        "Gotcha.",
        "Oh, you bet I am!",
        "You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?",
        "Whoa, ah!! We’re you just gonna give me some lemonade?",
        "Oh right, right.",
        "Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I’m such a jerk.",
        "Baywatch.",
        "Lifeguards.",
        "Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.",
        "They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?",
        "No, no, no, don’t get up, I got a cooler right here.",
        "Cool!!",
        "(entering with Monica) Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?",
        "Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way\n      would be, to not.",
        "It’ll kill him. I mean it’ll, it’ll just kill him.",
        "(looking out the window) Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his\n      new hammock. It’s like a Play-Doo Fat Factory. ",
        "What did they do?",
        "Hey-hey, Ross?",

        "Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do,\n      you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead\n      serious.",
        "(stopping him) No, no, you can’t, you can’t, okay, you can’t,\n      you can’t buy her pearls, you just can’t, you can’t, you can’t.",
        "Oh God. Uh, okay, here’s the thing, this is the thing, okay, the\n      thing is...",
        "Okay. I went down to the ‘Mattress King’ showroom and,\n      and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.",
        "They were in his office.",
        "I’m telling you man, I saw it.",
        "I’m not wrong! I wish I was. I’m sorry. Bet that barium enema\n      doesn’t sound so bad now, huh?",
        "You said number two.",
        "I know. (giggles harder)",
        "Uh.",
        "Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still. (Phoebe runs to the\n      window and gasps.)",
        "I’m tellin’ ya, he hasn’t moved since this morning.",

        "Well, now we got a reason.",

        "Hey uh, what’s a matter?",
        "Oh my God, is she going back to him?",
        "What are you ah, what are you gonna do?",
        "Well, it doesn’t matter what I would do.",
        "All right, you’re probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if\n      it was me, and this is just me, (Chandler gets ready to throw\n      another dart) I would ah, I would bow out.",
        "They have a kid together, y'know. They’re like, they’re like a\n      family, and if, I don’t know, there’s chance they could make that\n      work, I know I wouldn’t want to be the guy who stood in the way\n      of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?",
        "All right now remember, something this big and long is going to\n      be difficult to manouver, fortunately I have a lot of experience\n      in that area.",
        "All right, ladies and gentlemen, let’s poke. (they start to\n      advance the giant poking device) Steady. Steady. Okay, a little\n      higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, we’re approaching the\n      window (as he says this the camera cuts to their view of Ugly\n      Naked Guy, so that we actually see him!) Thread the needle.\n      Thread the needle. ",
        "Okay, retract the device, retract the device.",
        "Hey, that’s never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!",
        "Okay, pick a card, any card. (Monica picks one) All right, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it?",
        "All right, give it back to me. (takes the card back, but he looks at the card before he puts it back in the deck, he holds the deck to his forehead, and thinks a little while) 5 of hearts.",
        "I can’t tell you that, no.",
        "All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I’ll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn’t see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. (picks up a card and quickly looks at it) I just did it. (does it again) I just did it, again. Here, I’ll slow it down so that you guys can see it. (looks and the card in slow motion)",
        "Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.",
        "Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....",
        "I don’t know, Chandler is supposed to be passin’ ‘em around...",
        "Chandler!",
        "Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.",
        "No, only for s*x.",
        "Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!",
        "(angrily entering, to Chandler) Can I talk to you for a second?!",
        "Come on!! (motions for Chandler to come with him)",
        "I just got off the phone with my sister.",
        "Mary-Angela.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Why don’t you ask Chandler, ‘cause he’s the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin’ over Janice by groping my sister.",
        "Really? That’s great! You and my sister, sittin’ in a tree.",
        "Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?",
        "You are so the man! (motions him to come in, and he does) Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, ‘cause my Grandma doesn’t know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.",
        "She’s right in there. (motions to the living room)",
        "What’s goin’ on?",
        "What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?",
        "Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you’d be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!",
        "No! No! No! No, I’m not going to punch Chandler.",
        "No you won’t. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he’s sorry. But, (to Chandler) you’ve got one more apology to make, all right, you’ve got to apologize to Mary-Angela.",
        "All right.",
        "Cookie, now you can punch him!",
        "All right, that’s it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. (gets up) This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! (stops and turns around and asks Rachel) But, is he a big guy?",
        "And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.",
        "What? Me having a job?",
        "Well, I’m pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.",
        "Hey. What, what are you doing here?",
        "Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....",
        "Sure.",
        "All right.",
        "Oh, that’s, that’s ah, one of the old ones, he’s just taking it to the back.",
        "Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.",
        "Well, they go into the chipper.",
        "(to the guy operating the chipper) Hey! Hey!! (makes the ‘cut it’ motion with his hands)",
        "All right, I’ll take a box of the cream filled Jesus’s.",
        "Look Rach, wasn’t this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?",
        "If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you’ve got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.",
        "(entering, interrupting Rachel) Hey! I got great news!",
        "What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?",
        "Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?",
        "Not a problem.",
        "And now for the great news.",
        "Only if you think it’s better than this... (holds up an aerosol can) snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie.",
        "Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it’s a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.",
        "Yeah, the ah, trees that don’t fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.",
        "Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.",
        "(simulating an echo) Ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine...., eight, eight, eight... (Chandler hits him in the back of the head) Okay, Blast off!",
        "(hanging up the phone) Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?",
        "It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.",
        "What?",
        "Who?",
        "The what?",
        "Oh, okay. (to Ross) The what?",
        "(singing) You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, (picks a handkerchief from the pianist's pocket) you've got to pick a pocket or two..........",
        "Really? Thanks.",
        "Excellent, I'll be there.",
        "Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part.",
        "Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either.",
        "Yeah, I can dance, y'know. (starts to dance really, really, really badly)",
        "Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing.",
        "Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.",
        "Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?",
        "(reading) The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...",
        "Whoa, I'm not done.",
        "Done.",
        "Mark's a genius!",
        "And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, (sadly) 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'",
        "So, does that mean the audition is off?",
        "What?!",
        "It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.",
        "Bye. (does the jazz hands)",
        "I know, it was the best I could get out of them.",
        "People, people, people.",
        "Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?",
        "Great, you can cover Chandler.",
        "Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.",
        "Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it’ll take your mind off Janice, and if you don’t play, everyone will be mad at you ‘cause the teams won’t be even. Come on.",
        "Says who? Your mom?",
        "All right, we have to pick captains.",
        "What?",
        "Thank you.",
        "(to his team) All right, huddle up, right over here.",
        "I got it. (catches the ball)",
        "One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.",
        "Set....hike!",
        "Haaaaa! Hey-hey, thanks for stopping our ball.",
        "Yeah! Wow, your like from a whole other country.",
        "Hi-hi, I’m Joey.",
        "I’m sorry Dutch, I didn’t get that last little bit.",
        "Her name is Dutch, and also Marklan.",
        "Mar-klan.",
        "Yeah! Why don’t you stick around. You can sit right there.",
        "I think so.",
        "Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.",
        "Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I’ll let you have her.",
        "Well I don’t like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don’t feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You’re better with numbers and stuff.",
        "Fumble!",
        "What the hell’s the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.",
        "All right, that’s it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.",
        "Pheebs, run!",
        "After!!",
        "It’s hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.",
        "What are you gonna do?",
        "Okay.",
        "Here you go!",
        "Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it’s better if we’re on the same team.",
        "Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.",
        "Nice try. (to Margha) See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.",
        "Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I’m not playing with this guy, now.",
        "What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?",
        "Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn’t understand the question.",
        "Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of s*x.",
        "This sucks, I was just up by that much!",
        "(looking at the timer) Thirty seconds left on the timer!",
        "When they’re hungry enough, they’ll come in.",
        "(to Phoebe) Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?",
        "Cool.",
        "Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you’ll probably be hungry after the s*x.",
        "Hey.",
        "Check the freezer. If there’s none in there, then we’re probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It’s late.",
        "I discovered I’m able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.",
        "Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.",
        "Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we’ve got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.",
        "Haven’t you ever read the same book over and over again?",
        "The question should be Rach, what is not so great about The Shining. Okay? And the answer would be: nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it’s way better than that classic of yours.",
        "All right, you got it.",
        "Okay.",
        "Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.",
        "How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?",
        "These little women. Wow!",
        "Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo’s manuscript. I don’t see how he could ever forgive her.",
        "But Jo’s got a crush on Laurie. (Ross nods his head) Oh. You mean it’s like a girl-girl thing? ‘Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.",
        "No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.",
        "(noticing Chandler) What are you doing? (he pushes Chandler back to his side of the couch) Get back over on your side of the... (sees Robert in all his glory) Hello!! (to Robert) Hi, I’m Joey, we haven’t met.",
        "Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?",
        "Hey! (starts to laugh.) How’s it going?",
        "Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?",
        "Oooh, the next part’s the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...",
        "All right I’ll talk in code. (to Ross and Chandler) Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?",
        "Oh, all blank, and no blank, make’s blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!",
        "Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.",
        "Beth, Beth dies?",
        "Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?",
        "Then why would you say that?!",
        "Beth is really, really sick.",
        "Jo’s there, but I don’t think there’s anything she could do.",
        "Yeah.",
        "(nodding his head) Okay.",
        "(Voice Over) Previously on Friends.",
        "Yeah. We figured when we couldn’t find you, you’d gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?",
        "Look, Ross look, I’m on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that’s gonna get you in trouble.",
        "Yeah, and there won’t be a relationship left to rebuild.",
        "All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn’t find out some other way. (spins the chair around so that Ross is facing him) Did you think about the trail?",
        "(stomps on the footrest which pops Ross up into a sitting position) The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! (slapping his hands with each word) You always have to think about the trail!",
        "Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that’s all. I mean, come on, it’s just a little wax.",
        "Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?",
        "Don’t answer that.",
        "Awful! Horrible!",
        "She was nothing compared to you.",
        "Ewwwww!",
        "Y'know what, I don’t think we should listen to this anymore. (Goes to open the door)",
        "Why not?! (to Chandler) I’m hungry.",
        "Yeah, we’ll be fine.",
        "Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. (makes like he is trying to send a telepathic message to Rachel) Put olives on the pizza.",
        "You think I need a new walk?",
        "Well y'know, I’ve been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a ‘take notice’ walk.",
        "Whoa-ho-ho! (He looks at Chandler, who gives him a ‘come on’ look.) Yeah, okay.",
        "Maybe she killed him?",
        "(whispering) No, I really have to pee.",
        "(to Monica) Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?",
        "Done.",
        "So Pheebs what’s this guy like?",
        "Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?",
        "Yeah!",
        "Uh, y'know what, we’re having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we’ll need a little more time to think about it.",
        "Both of us? (points to Chandler and himself)",
        "We’ll be there.",
        "Uh, 10:30.",
        "4:30.",
        "Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?",
        "She was kidding about that right?",
        "God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?",
        "Dude, I don’t know.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don’t want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don’t want to be seeing.",
        "Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... (clears throat) y'know each would, (clears throat again) y'know (pause) be?",
        "Yeah, I guess, but what’s like heads and what’s tails?",
        "So what are you gonna do?",
        "Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.",
        "Nothing, he’s just really believes in that.",
        "Wow! This girl is good.",
        "(to Leslie) So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.",
        "(to Leslie) Ah, anything we might of heard of?",
        "(joining in) Home is Home Star stew.",
        "(to Phoebe) Wow, that was kinda brutal.",
        "Ah, he can’t make it, he said he had to his... (sees Ginger) Whoa-oh! (hides behind the coat rack.)",
        "Phew, close one.",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "Is ah, is Chandler around?",
        "Oooh.",
        "Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn’t something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?",
        "Aww, man. That’s the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he’s my roommate, she’s gonna tell him what I did.",
        "What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can’t, I can’t tell you that, it’s like the most awful, horrible thing I’ve ever done my whole life.",
        "All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad’s cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....",
        "I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.",
        "I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should’ve told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.",
        "I ran!!",
        "(entering from his bedroom) Morning.",
        "(to Chandler) Heard about the leg burnin’ huh?",
        "Listen, I ah, I know it’s a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?",
        "Yeah. You okay?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Where have you been?",
        "Can I see the comics?",
        "Okay, may I see the comics?",
        "Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.",
        "Well Ross was hangin’ out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....",
        "Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.",
        "Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.",
        "I had the same dream!",
        "Oh, I had the opposite dream.",
        "Yeah, I mean it’s never taken me a week to get over a relationship.",
        "Rach, it’s, it’s ah, it’s not that we don’t want to, really. (quietly) Are we talking models in their underwear?",
        "(He turns around to Chandler looking for approval to go with Rachel, Chandler mouths ‘Come on!’) (turning back to Rachel) Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "You’re smoking again?!",
        "(obviously cold) Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here!",
        "It’ll be great for next weekend.",
        "It’ll be great for next weekend. I mean, (in an Irish accent) it’ll be grrreat.",
        "Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother’s cab, but y'know what, I’ll stay.",
        "(to Chandler and Monica) Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?",
        "What? Mine aren’t tinted.",
        "Oh, now I have to go!!",
        "What’s going on?",
        "Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?",
        "Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!",
        "Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?",
        "Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.",
        "If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.",
        "Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.",
        "(opening the door) And there you go!",
        "Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.",
        "Okay, done.",
        "That’s ‘help’ spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!",
        "Hey!!",
        "Arrrghh!!",
        "Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?",
        "No, I wasn’t gonna ask you that, no.",
        "I-I can’t handle this, you guys.",
        "(pause) What?",
        "(pause) What?",
        "Yeah, and not put us in the middle.",
        "Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who’s going with who?",
        "Come on man, you drove all the way up here.",
        "Oh, nothing, no. It’s an acting exercise, I’m practising my fake laugh.",
        "What-what’s so funny?",
        "Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.",
        "Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.",
        "Well, have-have you told him how you feel?",
        "No-no-no-no-no. (They start to turn away, but Phoebe stops them, and turns them back to face her.)",
        "No.",
        "So, we’re walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, “Hey, let’s go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,” remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, “Nah, let’s just hang out at your place.” Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.",
        "Yeah, come on, think about it. You’re 18, okay, she’s 44, when you’re 36, she’s gonna be 88.",
        "Look, the point is, there’s a lot of women out there you haven’t even had s*x with yet!",
        "Yeah, in a poem maybe.",
        "Now, wh-what, what is that like?",
        "(to Ross) Why can’t I find that?",
        "Well, I want it!",
        "I don’t know, maybe I can’t. I mean, maybe there’s something wrong with me.",
        "Then you hold on to it!!",
        "All right, congratulations you lucky b*st*rd! (hugs him)",
        "I couldn’t help it, there love is so pure.",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?",
        "Every night!!",
        "(He’s recorded his voice on the tape) Joey’s your best friEnd. You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. (he laughs) And you also want to buy him hundreds of dollars worth of pants.",
        "(entering, dancing and singing) Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! (He dances around the dinner table and exits)",
        "Good. (He sets his stuff down and starts talking to Kate, another cast member.) Hey.",
        "Oh, so you’re playing Adrienne, huh?",
        "Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I’m Joey Tribianni.",
        "So the ah, play’s pretty great, huh?",
        "Oh, forget about it. She rocks!",
        "Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.",
        "Hey, I’ve done plays before. I’m a serious actor.",
        "See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn’t. Now, see, that’s acting.",
        "Yeah, that was real.",
        "I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can’t do it, they’re all like-like laughing at me.",
        "Hey!",
        "Wow, what-what do you think she wants?",
        "Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.",
        "Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?",
        "Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and nothin’. You look at me, and it’s nothin’. (He kisses her) Nothing.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it’s says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don’t know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you’re a bitch.",
        "It does in mine!",
        "Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she’s like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!",
        "God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, ‘Oh, I’m so talented.’ and ‘Oh, I’m so pretty,’ and ‘Ooh, I smell so good.’",
        "Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?",
        "Oh. (realises) Ohh. Ohh, you’re out of your mind.",
        "Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!",
        "Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and it’s nothin’. You look at me, and nothin’. (He kisses her, more passionately this time) Nothing.",
        "Better?",
        "Ah, Kate?",
        "You ah, you forgot your shoes.",
        "Hey, listen you ah....",
        "...feel like getting a cup of coffee?",
        "Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.",
        "Yeah! Oh my God! (to Chandler) Is this what it’s like to be you?",
        "Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we’re on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it’s like somebody’s ripping out my heart!",
        "Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?",
        "Hey, Kate!",
        "Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week...",
        "(to himself) And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah...",
        "Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani.",
        "(looks at her, shocked) What?!",
        "Get out of here, really?!",
        "Yeah?",
        "They gave me the shaft all right.",
        "Well Ahh, (he sees Kate and the director kissing) yeah! Yeah, sure, a drink sounds great.",
        "All right.",
        "Come on baby, don’t go. Please? What do you say?",
        "(to Kate) That guy’s like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?",
        "Hey, I’m not interested in her sweater! It’s what’s underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I’m going out with?",
        "Do you want me to want you to care?",
        "What?",
        "Come on baby, don’t go. Please? What do you say?",
        "Hey, it’s gonna be all right.",
        "What?",
        "Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah, y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight.",
        "Okay. (he gives her a peck on the cheek)",
        "Okay.",
        "(to Kate) Ah, are you okay?",
        "I don’t know.",
        "How do you mean?",
        "Maybe he could slip her the tongue.",
        "Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.",
        "And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!",
        "Something like that?",
        "Yeah.",
        "(to Ross) Hey.",
        "(to Monica) Hey.",
        "Hey.",
        "No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.",
        "Oh, it was so amazing. After the (pause) love making...",
        "Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming ‘cause, ‘cause her eyes keep going like this. (He closes his eyes and moves them around, kinda like he’s been processed by the devil, or something.)",
        "Hey.",
        "So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall?",
        "Y'know, about what happened with us.",
        "What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can’t tell me last night didn’t mean something to you. I-I was there, you’re not that good an actress.",
        "Nooo.",
        "Hi, Lauren.",
        "(on phone) Well, so anyway Beth, what I’m saying is I should’ve considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I’ve ah, I’ve recently learned what’s it like to be on your side of it, and I’m sorry. So, do you think you can forgive me? (listens) Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. (He sits down and crosses out something, and dials the phone again.) Hello, Jennifer? (listens) Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there? (listens) Oh, she’s not home huh? (listens) Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "Uh, listen I gotta double check for tickets tonight. Who-who got what?",
        "Two it is. Ross, how about you?",
        "But you said one.",
        "Okay. (to Phoebe and Chandler) Did ah, you guys mean you plus one?",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh, hey, you guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!",
        "(to Chandler) And I ah, borrowed some of your cologne. I hope she likes it.",
        "The green bottle next to the shaving cream.",
        "So, so, what’d ya think?",
        "I-I wasn’t in that.",
        "(sees Kate) Oh-oh, hey-hey, Kate! Listen I want you to meet everybody. Everybody, this is Kate.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, hey, Lauren. Uh, you guys this is, this is Kate’s understudy, Lauren.",
        "Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.",
        "No, they-they weren’t in the play.",
        "Yes!!! Ha-ha-ha!",
        "Anyone mind if I save this?",
        "Hey! Are you okay?",
        "Listen, drama critics they’re nothing but, but people who couldn’t make it as actors. You know what you should do?",
        "Oh, classy.",
        "Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too.",
        "Uh, de-clawing cats. Hey, tell ya what. Let me walk you home. We’ll stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.",
        "Oh, you didn’t see the Post?",
        "No. Why?",
        "Oh, absolutely! You’re talented and you’re good looking.",
        "I know! That’s why they trashed me!",
        "Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute.",
        "I, I don’t get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again.",
        "Kate, do you even like me?",
        "Well so, how come you blew me off? Y'know? How come you were with him?",
        "Thanks.",
        "(Checks to see if she’s drooling on his shirt.) Okay. Okay, okay, hey. (Lays her down and covers her with a blanket.) There we go, let’s get your feet up there. (Looks at her) Good night, Kate. Sweet dreams. (Picks up a garbage can) I’m gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.",
        "(entering, happily) Hey!",
        "Yeah! I stayed at Kate’s, but ah, nothing happened. Hey, Pheebs, where were ya?",
        "Oh, it was great! Yeah, I-I walked her home, and it was amazing how much we connected, y'know? Then ah, then she passed out, but then she woke up. Yeah? And we stayed up all night talking, and now we’re like totally crazy about each other!",
        "What?",
        "You-you think?",
        "Two brothers, one died!",
        "Yeah?!",
        "Sorry! Sorry, I’m late; sorry, I’m late! My duck and my chick and a fight, it-it was ugly.",
        "(surprised it’s Lauren) (hugs her) (whispering) Where’s Kate?",
        "(stunned) What?!",
        "Oh, ahh, go to the window. I’m wanna run down to the truck and show you something.",
        "(grabs the window from the outside and sticks his head in) (whispering) When is she leaving?",
        "(making like he is yelling up to the second floor) I’m coming up!",
        "Hey!",
        "Wh-wh-what’s going on? Wh-what’s this about L.A.?",
        "But, but wh-what about us?",
        "Well, so, stay for the museums!",
        "Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? I mean, I’ll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.",
        "(to Lauren) In a minute!!",
        "Yeah, I guess it is. (sees Kate is watching, he turns Lauren so that he can talk directly to Kate, but still look like he is talking to Lauren) Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick ‘cause this is killing me. One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you’ve got things you have to do now, and so do I. And so… I’m gonna get on this spaceship, (smoke starts pouring in from the ceiling, and a ladder comes down, with flashing, colored lights on the side of it) and I’m gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you’ll be long gone. But I won’t have aged at all. (gets on the ladder) So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I’m gonna want to meet her.",
        "(lying on a beach towel, recapping what happened in the last episode) Okay, so we went to the beach, because Phoebe found out about this lady who knew her mom and dad, and I don’t really know what happened with that.",
        "(voice-over) Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldn’t go out with a guy like Chandler...",
        "(voice-over) ...and he couldn’t let it go, and... I don’t really know what happened with that either. ",
        "(voice-over) Oh-oh! And then Ross’s new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up and Rachel convinced her to save her head. And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I don’t know what happened there either... ",
        "Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler. (gets up and leaves.)",
        "Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don’t you wanna stay here and talk about it?",
        "(jumping up in a hole that he is digging, he is shoulder deep) Hey, you guys! Take a look at this! (Chandler and Monica jump up and go over to the hole.) Check this baby out, dug me a hole!",
        "Oh no! No!! My hole!!",
        "(climbing out of the hole) What?! What?!! What is it?!",
        "Yeah, and I’m a little tired from digging the hole.",
        "Well, there’s really only one thing you can do.",
        "You’re gonna have to pee on it.",
        "Don’t blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.",
        "If you want some privacy you can use my hole.",
        "Me too.",
        "No?",
        "Sure, it’s hard to forget! But that doesn’t mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, (to Chandler) ever talk about.",
        "It’s between us and the sea, Ross!",
        "Nope.",
        "NO!!!",
        "All right. (gets up) ",
        "Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It’s eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.",
        "And I was tired from digging the huge hole!",
        "I’d seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...",
        "That’s right I stepped up! She’s my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I’d pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn’t. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.",
        "(laughs) That’s ‘cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.",
        "Tell us!",
        "(to Billy) So you’re the gynaecologist?",
        "And it’s not fake, it’s totally brutal.",
        "What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.",
        "Yeah, maybe it’s like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns. (pats Ross on the butt)",
        "Yeah. What are we getting?",
        "Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. (thinking aloud) Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?",
        "(sticking his head out the window) Hey, the fight’s starting!",
        "(sticking his head out the window) Fight’s over!",
        "Check it out, he’s winning! (to Monica) Pete’s winning!",
        "No-o-o!!",
        "Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck.",
        "Hey.",
        "(with a disgusted look) What was it?",
        "Whoa!!!",
        "No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.",
        "Yeah, right.",
        "So Pheebs, do they know about each other?",
        "Hey.",
        "(going over to him) Well?!",
        "Well what is it?!",
        "Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, \"Awww, he's got a Ross.\"",
        "Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.",
        "Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.",
        "Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.",
        "Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?",
        "Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.",
        "Oh sure, go with the sissy.",
        "Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.",
        "Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV.",
        "Look at this! A millionaire's checkbook.",
        "Hi, how ya doing?",
        "(looking at the checkbook) Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. (Monica is stunned) Oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is?",
        "Yeah, yeah. He’s got a, he’s got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can’t do anything about it. Is there something you can do?",
        "Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about\n      geography.",
        "Well, I think we all learned something.",
        "That you’re actually 50?",
        "Hey, Bonnie had s*x there!",
        "(walking up carrying a brown paper bag) Hey!",
        "No, it’s just my luggage.",
        "Hey!!",
        "Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!",
        "Hey-hey, check out the hat!",
        "(getting an idea) Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game\n      is?",
        "I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip\n      poker.",
        "Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, it’s like a\n      law!",
        "Hey, you know what naked card game is never boring?",
        "What?",
        "Okay, all right. ",
        "Fan out! Fan out!",
        "(jumping in triumph) OH YES!!!!!",
        "Yeah, well, I couldn’t find any cards, so it was either this or\n      Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff.",
        "All right, relax. It’s just a shoe.",
        "Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.",
        "Actually, y'know it’s kinda cold, so how about I keep my boxers\n      on, and give you all a peek at the good stuff?",
        "We’re playing Strip Happy Days Game!",
        "What’s the matter, Pheebs?",
        "What?!",
        "But I made cards!!",
        "(to Ross) Wanna play strip poker for practice?",
        "I’m telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!",
        "So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight,\n      you’re doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.",
        "Right, and you go with Rachel, Bonnie’s free tonight?",
        "How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide.",
        "Look, we’re not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!",
        "All right. But, you’re gonna have to tell them. (He opens the cabinet to reveal the chick and the duck living inside with Christmas lights and a disco ball as decorations.)",
        "Looks good, uh?",
        "Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!",
        "What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.",
        "Oh. What do you do?",
        "What? What’s wrong?",
        "(to Chandler) Dude, Phoebe’s mom has got a huge peni...",
        "Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don’t think any of them are gonna work out.",
        "Pretty nice?",
        "(to Peter) Good for you!!",
        "(looking at the flyer) Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!",
        "Uh, Pheebs, about your mom...",
        "(pause) How’s that going?",
        "That’s so sweet. (pause) I’m gonna get some coffee. (gets up and leaves)",
        "This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.",
        "Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn’t, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny ‘til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.",
        "Oh yeah? (opens up the center and takes out the stereo) If I can’t, I’ll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.",
        "Okay. (he gets in the unit and closes the door) See?! I told ya! ",
        "Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!",
        "(still trapped in the entertainment center) WHAT?!! ",
        "Yeah...",
        "(getting out) Awww, man! He promised he wouldn’t take the chairs!!",
        "Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn’t think big enough to fit a grown man!",
        "I was tryin’ to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I’m gonna do?",
        "(looking through a deck of cards) Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is!",
        "Dude, you don’t have to brag! We got nothing here!!",
        "Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there. (Goes back into the hall)",
        "(Returning carrying a couple of rusted lawn chairs) Huh?!",
        "Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!",
        "Just pickle.",
        "Yeah-eh-eah! (Rachel glares at him) Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant.",
        "Uhhhh. (He’s not sure)",
        "No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.",
        "Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.",
        "He cut off his ear.",
        "I’m out.",
        "Wow! That’s pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear ‘cause he sucked. What else you got in there?",
        "In the woods. No wait-wait, that’s the joke answer.",
        "Spock’s birth control.",
        "Wow! There’s a lot I didn’t know about vomit. (The duck comes to the door of the bathroom, quacking.) (To the duck) In a minute. (The duck goes back into the bathroom.)",
        "Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I’m home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there’s a few things you don’t get from book learnin’.",
        "How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?",
        "You wanna see what I got? (He gets up to empty out his pockets) Okay? I’ve got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!",
        "And a 50. (The salesman stops suddenly) Huh, these must be Chandler’s pants.",
        "Oh, I-I think I’m gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out.",
        "Wh-what’s going on?",
        "No he doesn’t!",
        "Well, it’s good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.",
        "Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.",
        "Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.",
        "Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?",
        "Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?",
        "I’m gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.",
        "All right that’s it, school is in session! (Exits and slams the door.)",
        "Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you’re gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.",
        "Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.",
        "I have actually not heard of that.",
        "Why don’t you tell me something I don’t know! (He storms out, and once Treeger closes the door behind him, Joey makes an ‘Oops!’ have.)",
        "Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he’d better come up here and apologize. I’ll see you later. (Starts to leave)",
        "He said that he wasn’t gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he’s gonna do is have you evicted—I’ll see you later.",
        "Well he made Rachel cry!",
        "All right! I’ll try! But if I can’t, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.",
        "All right, all right, all right. (Starts to leave, stops, and turns around) I mean I’ll have to check with him first, but I’ll think he’ll be cool with it. (Monica shoos him out.)",
        "Please don’t kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn’t there fault, it was mine.",
        "No you can’t do that, where would the chick and the duck live?",
        "Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I’m the chick and Chandler is the duck.",
        "Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I’ll do whatever you want.",
        "Yeah-yeah, absolutely.",
        "What, what is it?",
        "That’s not, prison lingo, is it?",
        "Yeah, there’s this superintendent’s dance, the Super Ball. I don’t know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he’s a crush on.",
        "Well, he’s too shy, he doesn’t thing he’s good enough to dance with girls yet.",
        "Aww, man, now we won’t be bank buddies!",
        "Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I’m doing something exciting and I don’t wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y’know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!",
        "No-no, thank you.",
        "All right, I’m here, let’s ahh, get this over with.",
        "Whoa-whoa, don’t we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like ahh, get really drunk?",
        "No, it’s okay, but if I’m Marge, my breasts are coming out my back.",
        "Come on man, you’re not a potato.",
        "Come on Treeger, don’t say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, let’s ahh, let’s try it again. Come on. (they start dancing again) Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y’know, I’m not really that comfortable dancing with a—(Treeger throws him) We-he!! Hey!",
        "Ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time. (He walks into the kitchen and does a little dance step on the way.)",
        "What?",
        "No I didn’t.",
        "No, I’m not! And it wasn’t a hop it was a pademarie.",
        "All right, well maybe I’m enjoying it a little bit. I mean I’m getting pretty good at it.",
        "Hey-hey, hold on, this isn’t some kind of like girly dance. All right, it’s like a sport, it’s manly!",
        "All right.",
        "I don’t know how to lead.",
        "What?!",
        "(To Mr. Treeger) So you ah, ready for our last practice?",
        "Look, you wanna use our place?",
        "We did it!!",
        "I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.",
        "Oh well, okay, good luck.",
        "Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?",
        "Okay.",
        "Go get ‘em Treeger.",
        "(intrigued) Really?",
        "No, I’m good.",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?",
        "Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.",
        "Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Hey guys. (to Chandler) Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?",
        "It's 4:30.",
        "Okay, I see what's going on here.",
        "Yeah! You don't like Kathy.",
        "Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?",
        "Good, and hey! My treat. (He turns to go into his bedroom then stops.) But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?",
        "Is she great or what?",
        "(to Kathy) I'll be right back. (to Chandler) What was that?",
        "Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.",
        "I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.",
        "Well then, do it better!",
        "Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.",
        "(opening the door wearing nothing but a sock, and holding a dart board over the `Little General.') Hey! (Chandler turns down the TV) Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?",
        "(leaving Central Perk and seeing Monica laying on top of Rachel\n      who is moaning in pain.) Oh my.",
        "Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.",
        "Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy’s\n      theory. Okay?",
        "Saw a girl with that vest.",
        "(on phone) Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks?\n      ‘Cause I was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those\n      guys are cute!",
        "(entering carrying a box) Hey!!",
        "I got you something! Open it! Open it!",
        "It’s cute, huh?",
        "Oh, well no problem there. (He picks up the chick, hugs it really\n      tight, and talks to it like it’s a little baby.)",
        "Hey.",
        "How’s she doing?",
        "Well yeah, don’t-don’t you think it’s a she?",
        "Well, anyway, I got to go change, I’m ah, meeting some of the\n      cast for drinks.",
        "What?",
        "Hey! Who was up from 2 o’clock this morning until 5 o’clock this\n      morning trying to get her back to sleep?",
        "Ohhh, here it comes.",
        "Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!",
        "That’s not what I said. Okay, I just meant...",
        "I don’t know, maybe we weren’t ready to have a chick.",
        "Do you think we’ll get our three bucks back?",
        "Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks\n      great in the blue one.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "(sees he’s watching Baywatch) Ohhh. (sees he still has the chick)\n      Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back\n      to the store today.",
        "Okay, good, good, good, ‘cause, good, ‘cause I was kinda having\n      second thoughts too. ",
        "That’s horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.",
        "What ‘cha doing?",
        "What about the chick?",
        "Are you sure?",
        "Sure.",
        "(stopping him) Wait. Give him a minute.",
        "Hey!",
        "Why?",
        "You can pee here!",
        "We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?",
        "Oh, I know...",
        "(entering the apartment) Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.",
        "It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?",
        "Why not?",
        "Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... \"Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!\"",
        "She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.",
        "(whining and heading toward the door) Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...",
        "Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?",
        "Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.",
        "So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?",
        "All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.",
        "What kind of smell?",
        "All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?",
        "You wanna see her again, right?",
        "So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah!",
        "All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! (Ross hesitates, looks unsure) Oink!",
        "(entering) Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!",
        "Our place, the hall! I...",
        "(Unimpressed) A book? (Suddenly interested) Is it like a book that's also a safe?",
        "You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. (Joey leaves, comes back in.) Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?",
        "Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.",
        "Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!",
        "Hey!",
        "You know, uh... [Joey moves the pen case out onto the counter.] Chandler got you a gift, too.",
        "Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!",
        "Ah. Hm. (To Kathy) Wanna go to bed?",
        "Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. (Tries to strike a sexy pose up against the doorway to his room. Then goes inside).",
        "(opening bedroom door) Hey, that coupon expires, you know.",
        "Great! All right, so I’ll call you later.",
        "That would be Casey. We’re going out tonight.",
        "No, things are fine with Kathy. I’m having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.",
        "Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself! (Laughs)",
        "Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?",
        "What is the big deal? It’s not like we’re exclusive.",
        "You got all that from the back of her head?",
        "Who’s Elaine?",
        "(on the other end at a pay phone) Hey, it’s me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.",
        "We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I’ll be there as soon as I can.",
        "‘Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to—(he stops talking suddenly)",
        "Yeah?",
        "Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more—(his time runs out for real)",
        "(on phone) Hey dude, it’s me.",
        "Listen uh, I’m really sorry, it looks like I’m gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn’t there!",
        "Yeah, it must’ve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.",
        "Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.",
        "Aww man! I can’t believe I locked myself out again! (He knocks on the door.)",
        "(rushing in) Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?",
        "Why?",
        "Well, you’re amazing.",
        "(very excited) A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That’s the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?",
        "Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.",
        "Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I’m gonna do that.",
        "No-no-no, I think I’m gonna see how things go with Kathy. She’s pretty cool.",
        "No-no, Kathy.",
        "No. No, Kathy.",
        "Y’know what I think? I think somebody’s got a little crush on Casey. How ‘bout I fix you two up? What do you think?",
        "Hey! Samboucha Margarita?",
        "Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.",
        "What’s up?",
        "You do?",
        "Well, you’re timing couldn’t be better. She’s not my girlfriend anymore.",
        "Yeah, she broke up with me.",
        "Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that’s why I let people watch.",
        "Well, I’ve been better. But, I’m all right. So you like her huh?",
        "No-no-no, no it’s uh, it’s okay.",
        "Yeah. You know why? ‘Cause you can to me first.",
        "But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you’re work cut out for you. ‘Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she’s into some other guy. So…",
        "Who?",
        "What?",
        "And what?! Did you sleep with her?!",
        "What?!! That’s even worse!!",
        "I don’t know! But it’s the same!",
        "Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!",
        "Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line, that you-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!",
        "Is that why you bought all this stuff?! (Chandler makes a face like \"Well, kinda.\") Well, y’know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there’s a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I’m not gonna eat! You know why?!",
        "Because it’s all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I’m not happy about you either. (The bread maker dings) Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you. (Joey walks into his bedroom and slams the door.)",
        "I think I know that girl.",
        "Oh yeah, I definitely know her.",
        "Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?",
        "Well, why do you call him Gandolf?",
        "No, I had s*x in high school.",
        "Will you calm down, he’s just a human guy.",
        "Really?!",
        "All right, I’ll see you guys.",
        "I have an audition, but I’ll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?",
        "Okay. (leaves as the phone rings)",
        "Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you’d be out partying with Gandel-worf.",
        "So you’ve been sittin’ around here all mornin’?",
        "So what if he didn’t come! We can still go out and party ourselves!",
        "Well, we could do that!",
        "We’ll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yeah!!",
        "Yeah! All right? Let’s go!",
        "All right, so we’ll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we’ll head back out.",
        "So, we’re having fun, right?",
        "We don’t need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we’ll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.",
        "Are you serious?!",
        "Thank God! I’m exhausted!",
        "Yeah, but uh, I don’t want to be up too late, so uh, I’ll have a decaf.",
        "I can’t hear a word you’re saying, my ears are ringing so bad.",
        "Yeah, I know.",
        "Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.",
        "We’re 29, we’re not women.",
        "It’s the chick! She’s…going through some changes.",
        "Good luck. (to Monica) And I’m still right!",
        "She’s mad because I know today’s her laundry day and that means she’s wearing her old lady underpants.",
        "Yeah, what’s that about?",
        "Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?",
        "Six.",
        "All right, we’ll start with…apples.",
        "Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt.",
        "Okay, the last thing…",
        "No-no, not for like another two weeks.",
        "Serious?",
        "No! All right, who-who makes up the questions?",
        "Huh.",
        "I know.",
        "Animals dressed as humans.",
        "(to Chandler) The Irish gig guy?!",
        "It’s All Relative.",
        "(to Chandler) Nana?",
        "(answering the question) Althea!",
        "I took a shot.",
        "Hey, no way, that rooster’s family!",
        "What do you have against the duck?! He doesn’t make any noise!",
        "Look, we are not gonna…",
        "(shocked) Dah!! (Chandler motions for him to calm down.)",
        "Oooooh!",
        "Okay.",
        "Big fat goalie.",
        "Weekend at Bernie’s.",
        "Everyday use.",
        "Guest.",
        "Uhh, 11!",
        "YEAH!!! YES!!!",
        "I call Monica’s room!",
        "Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, I’m sight of the room and I called it.",
        "What?",
        "Hey—ooh Pheebs, are they in there?",
        "Oh wow! You can tell this soon.",
        "What?!",
        "You can’t just ignore the bet! It’s a bet! You bet and you bet and if you lose, you lose the bet!",
        "Hey, don’t get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!",
        "But it is our apartment!",
        "Did you see the size of the closets?!",
        "Awwwww!! (They lean back all the way.) Awwwwwww!!!",
        "Check it out! Check it out! Guess what job I got? [smoothes the blue blazer he's wearing and has a big grin on his face]",
        "Oh, tour guide at the Museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.",
        "No, not really. They give you all the information. It's like memorizing a script. [demonstrates] \"And on your left, you have Tyrannsoarus rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.\"",
        "Yeah, but I can pronounce \"Jurassic\".",
        "[disgustedly] You're really thinking of having s*x with your brother?",
        "Oh.",
        "Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.",
        "[gesturing to what I'm presuming is the Mastadon] Okay, now the Mastadon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.",
        "[looks nervous] Shhhh. This is a museum. No talking. [moves group along and gestures to a three legged foot] Okay, now right down here we have, uh... a large foot.",
        "Okay, moving right along. [moves group away] Come on.",
        "Oh, uh, would you mind sitting here? [gesturing across from him] I'm saving this seat for my friend Ross.",
        "Doctor? I didn't know he had a nickname.",
        "Well, uh, how come?",
        "That's crazy.",
        "I, I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables but Ross is one of my best friends. If I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it.",
        "Ross, Ross, over here man. [gestures beside him] I saved you a seat.",
        "It's no big deal you know. You do what you gotta do, right?",
        "[looks at him for a second and then gets up to throw his garbage away.] Whatever.",
        "Look, Ross, really, it's no big deal. You know, you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then, so be it. I understand. When I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right? So, you know, it's cool. I'll see you tomorrow. [leaves]",
        "[gets up, tray in hand, and walks to the middle table] I will sit with you Dr. Geller. [he puts his tray down on the table and Ross and Joey shake hands.]",
        "[stands up, whips coat off and throws it on the floor vehemently] I'm Joey. I'm an actor. I don't know squat about dinosaurs.",
        "You hang in there Ted!",
        "Done! I did it! Heh, who’s stupid now? (He smiles and has cookie remains all over his teeth.)",
        "Well, I know what I’m giving you for Christmas.",
        "Ohhh!",
        "Hey, Mon! I’m not doing anything, why don’t you fire me?",
        "Good enough to get fired.",
        "Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?",
        "Yes!",
        "What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.",
        "Sure! Where are the seats?",
        "Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?",
        "Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!",
        "Oh, what are you gonna do? You’re gonna fire me?",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "(checks his watch) Damn! (runs out to work)",
        "(entering from the dining room) Hey.",
        "Hey, what happened to your fancy chef’s jacket? (sees there’s a burn spot on it)",
        "You got it! Oh-oh! (He starts patting the burned spot, which just happens to be over her breast.)",
        "It’s still a tiny bit on fire there.",
        "Yeah. Listen uh, I’d prefer it if you didn’t call me Joey. Since I don’t know anyone here, I thought it’d be cool to try out a cool work nickname.",
        "(opening an envelope) There’s like-there’s like 300 bucks in this one!",
        "No ma’am.",
        "I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, \"Wow! It’s been a long time since I had… (tries to do the math in his head, but can’t) 327 + 238 dollars!\"",
        "And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don’t fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they’ll start listening to all the nice things I’ve been saying about you.",
        "Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.",
        "(interrupting) Hey! Chef Geller! Y’know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!",
        "You bet I do! I just ah, wasn’t listening then, that’s all.",
        "What are you gonna do? You’re gonna fire me?",
        "Well I guess I should’ve thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!",
        "Yep! Looks like it’s gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.",

        "(Holding a turkey leg) There’s gravy?",
        "I think I left a donut up here.",
        "Hey!",
        "(to Ross) That-that is a good trick.",
        "Chandler, look they’re actors. They’re there to do a job, just ‘cause they work together, doesn’t mean they’re gonna get together. I mean just ‘cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn’t mean it’s gonna happen with them.",
        "Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.",
        "Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?",
        "Well okay, so then you’re fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it’s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It’s when the heat goes away, that’s when you’re in trouble.",
        "Look, you guys have been to every play I’ve ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?",
        "Noooo!!",
        "Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?",
        "Yep! Grab a plate.",
        "No-no, stay right there. (Monica stops and Joey flips her a pancake, which flies over her head and lands in the living room.) Gettin’ closer.",
        "Listen also we’re uh, we’re watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.",
        "Oh yeah, who’s playing?",
        "All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!",
        "I don’t know, it smells good.",
        "(Holding a magazine) Wow! The new Playboy!",
        "Come here.",
        "Oh, yeah, totally! That’s such a turn-on!",
        "Oh-ooh, that’s the turn-on.",
        "Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, \"Hey, how you doin’?\"",
        "(to Phoebe) Hey, how you doin’?",
        "Well, you gotta give him something that he can’t say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you’re guaranteed he’ll say yes!",
        "Absolutely! And if it doesn’t, can I get the extra ticket?",
        "What the heck is that?",
        "No! Forget her, man! You don’t need her, you don’t need that!",
        "Dude, tell me she actually told you this.",
        "Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There’s a lot of theories that didn’t pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.",
        "Okay, for next time, what do you say?",
        "What’s ready?",
        "I don’t know, it looks the same.",
        "Oh yeah!",
        "How’d it go?",
        "(answering phone) Hello.",
        "(answering phone) Hello.",
        "(answering phone) Stop callin’!!",
        "All right!",
        "Hey!",
        "I’m sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.",
        "No! I’m putting that in my room.",
        "Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?",
        "Five years.",
        "Hey! Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time.",
        "No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don’t know why you’re pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there’s a spot open.",
        "Yeah!",
        "What?",
        "All right. But if you weren’t my best friend.",
        "(entering) Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?",
        "(Something in Italian.) (Storms out.)",
        "My folks.",
        "I don’t know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.",
        "Yeah, y’know at first I thought we could talk about this y’know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don’t think I…",
        "Look, it’s not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don’t want to live with some one who doesn’t know what it is to be a friend. So, I’ll see ya. (He starts to leave, but Chandler grabs his bag and stops him.)",
        "Yeah! You did! And that’s why I’m leaving.",
        "When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!",
        "Yeah! But if would’ve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn’t have worried about it so much! See you around!",
        "We’ve got a box. (Motions to a large wooden box next to him.)",
        "(coming out of the bathroom) What’s twisted?",
        "Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!",
        "He’s fine!",
        "Chandler?",
        "Hey!",
        "He’s doin’ some thinkin’!",
        "You kissed my girlfriend!",
        "That doesn’t sound like thinking to me!",
        "Y’know I don’t think you should be talking at all in there! I think you’ve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!",
        "All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn’t mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you’re just an idiot in a box!",
        "So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?",
        "That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? (There’s no response from Chandler.) Okay.",
        "I’ll get it. (It’s Kathy.)",
        "Hey.",
        "That’s okay. Chandler’s the one I’m mad at.",
        "In the box.",
        "(starting to cry) Open the box!! (Runs over to do so.)",
        "He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! (He opens the box) Get out of there!",
        "Yeah, we’re gonna be fine! Get out!",
        "Yeah, you did some real good thinkin’ in there.",
        "Now go! ‘Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you’re secret Santa! (Chandler runs out and closes the door.)",
        "All right, who got Chandler? ‘Cause I uh, need to trade.",
        "Uhh, that’s not them. I’m gonna go call the police.",
        "Ohh, Nothing.",
        "I know what it did! Nothing.",
        "Like this. (Shrugs)",
        "Sure! It flushes it.",
        "Hey! (Sees Janice.) Ah!! (Janice screams in surprise.)",
        "And there it is.",
        "So what are you doing bringing her here?! There’s people here!",
        "Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. (They all look around and then back at Joey.) I’m tellin’ ya!",
        "Hey! What’s up?",
        "(to Rachel) I bet I stopped listening before you did.",
        "Dude, you’re not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.",
        "Hey-hey, what’s going on?",
        "Thanks for telling me!",
        "Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.",
        "Nope. (To Ross) Man look at this! Ross, I can’t believe you said you’d play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!",
        "(pointing to the TV) Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That’s called a scrum, okay? It’s kinda like a huddle.",
        "Ross! (Laughs) They’re gonna kill you!",
        "All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It’s not like he’s…Chandler!",
        "Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy (Points), and that guy (Points). And that one—Dude! They’re all huge!",
        "Well, maybe that’s because you’re closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.",
        "I totally don’t know what you’re talking about.",
        "No.",
        "Dude, if you go back out there, you’re gonna be Dead Ross!",
        "The Red Ross! Okay.",
        "Yeah, sure.",
        "Uhh, look, your eye’s still popping out a little, I’m gonna go get some ice.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Is it the shampoo? It’s guava.",
        "Oh! Wait-wait! (Reaches inside the shower.) Is it my bologna sandwich?",
        "Oh, wait-wait! (Reaches into the shower again.) Maybe it’s a pickle?!",
        "Hey, what have you guys been up too?",
        "Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.",
        "Hey that’s what all my relationships are like.",
        "Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.",
        "Yeah, what’ going on?",
        "Awwww!",
        "Surprise!!",
        "What-what-what is so funny?",
        "Now that’s a thinker.",
        "A little salami.",
        "Pastrami.",
        "Yeah. (He goes over to her.)",
        "Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.",
        "There was a seen in Footloose...",
        "Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl…",
        "What? Were you like in the movie, or… Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.",
        "Welcome to America. (They both kiss.)",
        "If you didn’t want to play, why did you come to the party?",
        "Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!",
        "All right look, y’know how-y’know how when you’re dating someone and you don’t want to cheat on them, unless it’s with someone really hot?",
        "All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you’re going to do something wrong, (He grabs two steaks from the freezer) do it right!",
        "Feel better now?",
        "Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.",
        "Well, I eat a lot of meat right?",
        "Well, suppose until the baby’s born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-you’d just be eating my animals.",
        "Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There’s no meat in beer, right?",
        "Okay, time to take off the bra. (She glares at him.)",
        "(trying not to be obvious) Take the bra off.",
        "Oooh, what you got there?",
        "Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y’know what goes good with that?",
        "Hm-mm, corn beef.",
        "Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that’s much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?",
        "(He starts looking longingly at the sandwich.) Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?",
        "Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?",
        "Guggly worm.",
        "Glow-pop giggly jammer.",
        "(examining it) Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year. (Monica drops the sandwich)",
        "(going over and picking up the rod) That’s all right. Hey you guys, you know what’s going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, \"Joey, what are you doing with your life?\" stuff. I can say, \"Well, I’m doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?\"",
        "Look, there’s nothing I can do for him right now, he’s still in his sweat pants, that’s still Phase One. Y'know? I’ll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.",
        "Gettin’ drunk and going to a strip club.",
        "Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.",
        "Yeah.",
        "(entering) Hey-hey!",
        "Oh my God, you guys have no idea.",
        "Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how’s he doing?",
        "(goes over to Chandler) Hey buddy! How’s it going?",
        "(To the rest of the gang) Hey, see that? He just needed his pal to come home. All right, uh, I’ve got to go memorise my lines. (Starts to go his bedroom) Me and Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning! Yeah-yeah!",
        "(running from his bedroom) Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!",
        "Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don’t have time! They’re just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.",
        "(rushing in) Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I’m here! I’m here!",
        "Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!",
        "(trying to act like he’s not the one that stinks.) Whoa! Yeah, what the hell is that? What smells so bad?",
        "Y’know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?",
        "No-no, it’s uh, it’s Heston.",
        "Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.",
        "Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?",
        "Interesting.",
        "How ya doin’?",
        "I guess you wouldn’t believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?",
        "No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I’m an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I’m doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.",
        "Yeah-yeah, I’m one of the cops that won’t work with you ‘cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I’m really sorry, but I stink!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh no-no-no, you don’t understand…",
        "Oh yeah, yeah.",
        "Yes sir! Yes sir, I’m-I’m—(he starts to leave)",
        "Yeah. Oh, yeah.",
        "I don’t wanna.",
        "I wanted to go to the strip club!",
        "Yeah, all right. (Ross enters.)",
        "(coming in from his bedroom) What is that?",
        "Maybe he found you flip-flop.",
        "Whoa! Is this p0rn? What did I do? I must’ve hit something on the remote.",
        "No, we didn’t even pay our cable bill—maybe this is how they punish us.",
        "Maybe we shouldn’t pay our gas bill? (Stops and thinks about what he just said.)",
        "(to Chandler) Why would he turn off the TV? (Chandler shrugs.)",
        "Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!",
        "Imagine a protective p0rn bubble if you will, okay?",
        "Hey.",
        "Pheebs! You’re blocking the p0rn! Look out!",
        "Yeah right.",
        "Yeah, he likes p0rn.",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!",
        "You play hard to get.",
        "Then you go to Tokyo.",
        "Way to be strong, man!",
        "Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. ‘Cause you already told her you love her and she didn’t say it back, then she called you and told you that there’s another guy, so yeah, go to London that’ll scare her!",
        "Ross! Ross! If you’re going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars? (Chandler nods his head no.)",
        "(pause) Nothing. No, nothing.",
        "Hey.",
        "Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!",
        "Noo! Nothing!",
        "I think you’re right.",
        "One.",
        "That’s kinda nice.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah!!",
        "Well, that went well. Yeah.",
        "(To the gang) Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?",
        "Hey, what’s up? (He has solved the problem of eating the steak, he’s eating it with his hands.)",
        "Well, I figured we’re in another country, so it doesn’t count.",
        "(approaching) Ross, hey, the band’s ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so…",
        "You spit on me man! (Wipes his face.)",
        "Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?",
        "Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!",
        "No you don’t, I just saw you go in there with Monica!",
        "Look, which one of us is gonna be having s*x in there, me or you?",
        "My Giant? I love that movie!",
        "Can I ask you something?",
        "Felicity and I, we’re watching My Giant, and I was thinking, \"I’m never gonna be as good an actor as that giant.\" Do you think I’m just wasting my life with this acting thing?",
        "I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y’know, you think I’ll ever get there?",
        "Thanks man.",
        "But what about how much taller he is than me?",
        "I mean, there’s no way I can make myself taller now, y’know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?",
        "Hey, Monica, wow you’ve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.",
        "Had the beef-tips, huh?",
        "Hi!",
        "All right, I’m gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.",
        "Why would you need to say hi to them, you’ve been feeding them for four days?",
        "Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!",
        "Hey!",
        "Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?",
        "Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey’s your pal. Joey’s your buddy. \"Where is everybody?\" \"Well, they’re hanging out with Joey.\"",
        "Oh well, hey, Joey’s loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he’ll be there.",
        "What do ya say? What do ya say?",
        "I knew I shouldn’t have mentioned it! That’s what I wanted to name my kid!",
        "Hey!",
        "No, but I’m gonna!",
        "Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.",
        "Someone you didn’t make up!",
        "Yeah, that guy really hurt us.",
        "All right look man, I didn’t want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It’s not even a name; it’s barely even a word. Okay? It’s kinda like chandelier, but it’s not! All right? It’s a stupid, stupid non-name!",
        "I’m sorry man, I didn’t—I’m-I’m sorry. I’m sorry. (Goes over and comforts him.)",
        "So I guess it’s Joey then!",
        "(answering the door.) Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in. (He brings them inside.)",
        "Dude, I am sorry about what I said!",
        "It’s not that bad.",
        "So, you’re just Bing?",
        "No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.",
        "See you later, Gene.",
        "What’s up with Gene?",
        "Nah, you’re not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.",
        "Ohh! (Realises it was all a trick to get Phoebe to name the baby Chandler.)",
        "(joining in, in his sleep) Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!",
        "(proudly) Oh, you should here me.",
        "Look, I told ya, I’m not going to any clinic! I don’t have a problem, you’re the one with the problem! You should go to a \"Quit being a baby and leave me alone\" clinic!",
        "Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you’ve just had your first class!",
        "Ohhh, yeah!",
        "I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it.",
        "That’s not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh!",
        "You can’t do anything!",
        "This sucks! I didn’t know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! I’m so tired!",
        "Yeah, well…",
        "Yeah, Rach, I think you’re handling that really well.",
        "I am… (Looks in his date book.) free!",
        "(still looking in date book) Hey! That’s the day after I stop menstruating! (They all look at him.) This isn’t mine.",
        "Joey Tribbiani.",
        "(sleepily) Yeah, she is. Wow! (Falls back asleep, loudly) How you doin’?",
        "What?!",
        "(asleep) So why don’t you give me your number?",
        "(muffled by the mouth guard) Hey you guys! What’s happening?",
        "(muffled) Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it’s gonna help me not to snore.",
        "(takes out the mouth guard) I know I don’t have too! It tastes good. (Puts it back in.)",
        "(muffled by the mouth guard) Dude! I am trying to sleep! (Shrugs to say, \"What’s up with that?\")",
        "Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This (His video camera) is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?",
        "I gotta get the before shot!",
        "Oh! (In an announcer type voice) And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee! (He grabs his side and doubles over in pain.)",
        "Ooh, something hurts!",
        "Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.",
        "Oh my!",
        "Not in my head.",
        "(in a sexy voice) Yep! There's always room for Jell-O…",
        "Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, (snaps his fingers and in a sexy voice) Grandma's chicken salad…",
        "(entering) Ross! Get a shot of this. (He's carrying an issue of the USA Today and hands Ross the camera.) Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies… (Throws the paper away to reveal a copy of Playpen, which is the TV version of Playboy Magazine.) Check it out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff. (Joey opens the magazine and Ross sticks the camera in it.)",
        "Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.",
        "Yeah, I was bummed too.",
        "I think Saturday--(groans in pain again).",
        "(entering from the elevator caring gifts for the kids) Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop. (He doubles over in pain in front an old man in a wheel chair.) Get up! Get up! Get up! (The old man waves him away.)",
        "Umm, well, what else could it be?",
        "Or?",
        "Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up.",
        "(interrupting) Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up, up is not an option--what's a urethra? (Monica whispers what it is in his ear.) Are you crazy?!",
        "Ohh, get these things out of me!",
        "I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs! (He starts rocking back and forth, taking Ross with him.)",
        "Argh!",
        "Argh!",
        "Oh my God.",
        "They're so small! (Both he and Ross look at them with satisfied looks on their faces.)",
        "Are you kidding? I love that guy! (Starts singing) Morning’s here! Morning is here—",
        "See, this is a great apartment.",
        "Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants.",
        "You have Knicks tickets?",
        "(examining the tickets) Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!",
        "Yeah!",
        "You’re not stupid. You’re meaner than I thought.",
        "Yeah, you do!",
        "Come on!",
        "Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?",
        "Oh come—look, when I was a kid my dad’s company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn’t in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!",
        "Hey!",
        "We don’t make enough fun of you already?",
        "Oh-no, don’t try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.",
        "What?",
        "All right look, Ross, he’s right. Emily’s great, she’s great! But this way too soon, you’re only gonna scare her!",
        "No! You don’t want to wreck it, you don’t want to go to fast!",
        "Wait-wait-wait-wait! (To Chandler) Come on! Come on, let’s trade! The timing’s perfect, I just clogged the toilet!",
        "Yes! Didn’t you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn’t read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!",
        "It’s the Knicks!",
        "Whoa!",
        "Huh.",
        "Yeah, the Knicks rule all!",
        "Done!",
        "Oh.",
        "Ooh, we could end up with nothing.",
        "Ooh, I like that.",
        "Come on man, you know I’d do it for you! Because, you’re my best friend.",
        "All right!",
        "Okay!",
        "What’s the game?! What’s the game?!",
        "Uhh, they’re tall.",
        "Oh.",
        "Yeah! Okay. (Joey picks a card.) Phoebe, you look, I can’t.",
        "Okay. Okay. (He looks at the card.) Ace!",
        "What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!",
        "Okay.",
        "Uh-huh, not as high as…(picks a card) It worked! King!",
        "Why?!",
        "Seriously, good game though. Good game. (He tries to congratulate them, but they pull away.) (To Chandler) What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!",
        "Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y’know, kinda like a peace offering.",
        "Hey, want a beer? (Hands him a beer and sits down in one of the chairs.) (Jumping up.) WHOA!!!!",
        "I don’t know.",
        "I don’t want to move again!",
        "That was one good minute!",
        "Good night.",
        "Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.",
        "Yeah! Yeah!",
        "Monica and Rachel made out. (Giggles like a schoolboy and Monica glares at him.)",
        "Hey! (Singing) Get into gear!",
        "(happily) Okay!",
        "Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!",
        "Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?",
        "Okay.",
        "You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?",
        "All right!",
        "Mornin' Pheebs!",
        "(interrupting) Was his name Angus? (Monica and Chandler laugh.)",
        "Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London.",
        "Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh…",
        "Hey, Ross, Bodington's!",
        "That was good beer.",
        "Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.",
        "Later! (Exits.)",
        "(To Chandler) I bet it was about her a little.",
        "Say that to him and you're golden. (She just glares at him.)",
        "Hey, Pheebs!",
        "(Jumping out of his way) See ya!! (To the girls.) What the hell was that?!",
        "(Poking his head out.) Havin' some trouble?",
        "I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.",
        "(In tremendous pain) All right. Good deal.",
        "Uh, okay, Pheebs?",
        "Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?",
        "All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!",
        "Yeah, all of us! All day!",
        "Phoebe!",
        "Mine!",
        "Nooo, I said we needed a new plan.",
        "Which, is the new plan!",
        "Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?",
        "I know. Ross is getting married.",
        "Everybody’s doing stuff!",
        "(snaps his fingers) We could climb Mt. Everest!",
        "No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Hey!",
        "We’re gonna climb Mt. Everest!",
        "We could get that Everest video though.",
        "And while we’re down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! (Chandler’s excited.) Oh, y’know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.",
        "Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Yeah we are!",
        "It's never gonna happen.",
        "Don’t answer that.",
        "Awful! Horrible!",
        "She was nothing compared to you.",
        "Ewwwww!",
        "(taking apart the invitation) Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper! You’re at the wedding, you have to cry, \"Handkerchief?\" \"No-no, I got my invitation.\"",

        "Don’t worry man, I get to bring a guest. We’ll show him.",
        "I knew that! (They all look at him) I sooo didn’t know that, but you should see your faces.",
        "Heyyy. (They all try and hide their invitations.)",
        "He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.",
        "Ohhh.",
        "Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.",
        "It’s better! You can’t go to a museum in your underwear!",
        "I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!",
        "Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!",
        "It’s all London, baby! Here we go. (He takes a picture of a less than enthused Chandler and starts towards the girls’ apartment.)",
        "Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don’t want to lose that.",
        "Ohh!! (Runs to his room.)",
        "Woo-hoo!!",
        "London baby!",
        "(louder) London baby!!",
        "Bye, Pheebs!",
        "London baby!! (And Rachel slowly closes the door, sadly.)",
        "Come on! Do something!",
        "Okay, here! (Gives him the camera.) I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey. (Joey folds out his \"pop-up\" map of London. All of the major landmarks pop-up like in a pop-up book.)",
        "It’s London, baby! All right, the hotel’s here. (Points to the map.) Wait. No, we wanna go… No. I know. (Sets the map down.) I’m gonna have to go into the map. (So Joey literally steps into the map.)",
        "I got it! (Picks up the map and starts walking.) Here we go.",
        "Shhh! (Pause) Man, you made me lose it! (He goes into the map again.)",
        "All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I’ve ever seen. Hey! (Pushes Chandler in front of the camera.) Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?",
        "Really? To what?",
        "Man, you are Westminster Crabby. (He starts chasing Chandler towards the Abbey.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Check this out? Huh? (Joey has this big tall hat with a British flag on the front of it.) Yeah. That’s the stuff. What do you think?",
        "Well, I like it. Here you go. (He pays for the hat.)",
        "Oh, I embarrass you?",
        "Oh yeah? (Puts the hat on.) If you’re gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh. (Takes off the hat.) Sorry!",
        "Me too.",
        "Noo!! I’ve had the best day ever! Dude, check this out!",
        "Sh-shh-shh! (He motions for her to watch something he has taped.)",
        "(on tape) Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.",
        "(on tape) Oh, Chandler.",
        "That’s Fergie baby!!",
        "Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I’m in my map and-and…(Ross enters) Hey!",
        "Wait up! (They both run to the bathroom.)",
        "Yeah. (Pause) Hey, I hope Ross didn’t think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!",
        "(on phone) Hey, Pheebs! It’s Joey!",
        "That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?",
        "Kinda, but I’ve just been having way too much fun.",
        "No, I don’t think so.",
        "Who’s seven?",
        "Ahh, the babies miss me?",
        "What? You ordered pizza without me?!",
        "Two pizzas?!",
        "Wait, well, where did you get it from?!",
        "What’s in it?",
        "(Looking up at the waiter)That’s not food...No, I don’t, no...(Taps Chandler on the shoulder.) Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can’t even remember what Phoebe looks like.",
        "(Pointing  at Chandler.) Your different here too. Your mean in England. (Chandler throws his hands up to his head in frustration. They walk away from each other.)",
        "Hey, best man number two, Joey Tribbiani. Now I’m not good with the jokes like Chandler here. Boy...but ahh, I just want to say congratulation to the happy couple. I first met Ross in this coffee house back home...Home...New York City...Where everybody knows my name. Well anyway, I love you guys. (pointing at everyone.) But not as much as I love America. (Looking at Chandler.) Could we please..go home now?",
        "(Putting his arm around her.) I’m not going anywhere, sweetheart.",
        "Hello?",
        "Hey. I spent the night out. I met this cute bridesmaid. She is so...",
        "Ahh Pheebs, you know you’re still my number one girl.",
        "Ohh great!!!",
        "(Confused.) But, he loves Emily?",
        "Okay.",
        "Hold on. Hold on. (Picking up a note pad and writing and reading the message aloud.) Rachel coming. Do...Something.",
        "Right!",
        "Hey.",
        "Have you seen Monica?",
        "(With a confused look on his face.) What?",
        "Look we’ve got to find her. Phoebe just called!! Rachel’s coming to tell Ross she loves him!!",
        "I know! That’s why we got to find Monica!! You know where she is?",
        "(Whispering.) Pisst, Monica. Alright, we really need to start looking out for Rachel. I’ll cover the front door. You watch that big hole at the back of the building and I got Chandler covering Ross.",
        "Okay. (They both walk off to watch for Rachel.)",
        "Hey, Felicity.",
        "Yeah.",
        "(In a New York accent.) Fuggetaboutit. (She giggles.) How you doin?",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "(Smiling.) Ohh great!! (Putting the phone to his ear.) Hello. (He begins to escort her down the aisle.)",
        "No, but it’s okay. She just came in and gave him a hug, that it.",
        "No.",
        "Ah, I’m-I’m walking down the aisle...Still walking. (Mrs. Waltham takes her place.) I’m about to pass the bridesmaid I hooked up with last night. (Looking at the bridesmaid.) Hey! (Talking to Phoebe.) I told her \"Hey.\" And now I’m at the front with Ross. It’s Phoebe. (He shows Ross the phone.) He looks pretty mad. Uh...I’d better go.",
        "Hey!",
        "Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, don’t you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?",
        "What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!",
        "Come on Ross! Look, I-I don’t have any brothers; I’ll never get to be a best man!",
        "(pause) I’ll never get to be a best man!",
        "(impatiently tapping Chandler on the shoulder) What about me?! You-you just said I could!",
        "I can’t believe you’re not picking me.",
        "Yes! (to Chandler) Shame about you man.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Do you guys have like a big bowl I can borrow?",
        "(grabs it) Thanks.",
        "Oh, we’re having a big party tomorrow night. Later! (Starts for the door.)",
        "Nooo, later. (Walks out the door.)",
        "Oh, it’s Ross’s bachelor party.",
        "Are you bachelors?",
        "Are you strippers?",
        "Then you’re not invited. (Starts for the door again.)",
        "Oh-whoa, what party?",
        "Baby shower. Wow! That sounds sooo like something I don’t want to do! Later! (Finally, he makes his exit.)",
        "This is what I’ve got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.",
        "Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I’ve got you, me, and Chandler and I’m gonna invite Gunther ‘cause, well, we’ve been talking about this pretty loud.",
        "All right—oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I’d really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.",
        "Okay! We’ll need a six-pack of Zima.",
        "You got it.",
        "Well, there’s gonna be strippers there. He didn’t say anything about no strippers.",
        "Oh, I chose not to hear that.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther don’t-don’t forget your shirt. (He gives Gunther his shirt and Gunther leaves.)",
        "Oh, little party favours, check it out! (It’s a shirt that reads, \"Ross Geller, Bachelor Bash 1998\")",
        "Oh-oh! (Shows him what’s on the back, \"Best Man Joey Tribbiani, with a huge picture of him.)",
        "Oh, hey, don’t forget your shirt.",
        "Okay, hey, museum geeks, party’s over. Okay. Wave bye-bye to the nice lady. There you go. Back to your parent’s basement. All right. (The museum geeks exit and Joey unlocks his door and lets the chick and the duck out.) Come on boys, come on out! Here you go. All right.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Oh yeah-yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this. Stare at the wall. (The duck complies.) Hardly move. (The duck complies.) Be white. (The duck complies.)",
        "Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin’ ya. And listen if any of my friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday…",
        "Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around.",
        "Yeah. I’ll let you play with my duck.",
        "Hey, (realises he doesn’t know her name.) stripper! (He notices that the ring box is open, so he picks it up, sees it’s empty and starts to panic.)",
        "(running and banging on Chandler’s door) The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!",
        "The ring is gone!",
        "Dude, this isn’t funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everything’s cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper’s gone and the ring is gone!",
        "Of course!! (Shrugs.)",
        "Ugh! I don’t know what I’m going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don’t care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn’t an emergency, then what is?",
        "Hey…",
        "So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that’s nice!",
        "I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those…",
        "(laughs, softly) Yeah, the stripper stole it.",
        "Dude, I screwed up, you don’t have to turn me in!",
        "Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they’re gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.",
        "I did that too! They wouldn’t give me her real name or her number. They said, \"If I bothered them again they’d call the police.\" I said, \"If you talk to the police, you tell them I’m missing a ring!\"",
        "Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I…",
        "Oh, that sounds like fun, but we’ve got a ring to find!!",
        "All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won’t recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. (to Ross) You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I’ll be uh, Mr. Wong.",
        "There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!",
        "I don’t get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn’t take it, and I didn’t take it; and you (Chandler) didn’t take it, then who did? (The duck quacks.) Shh! We’re trying to think! (Ross and Chandler realise it at the same moment and stare at Joey, who doesn’t get it. After a short pause, with the duck still quacking, Joey figures it out and starts pointing at the duck.)",
        "If anything should happen to him…",
        "So! Things can go wrong! You don’t know! What if he doesn’t make it?!",
        "Yeah, but what if he doesn’t? He’s such a good duck.",
        "I’m so worried about him, y’know?",
        "H-h-h-how’s the duck?",
        "Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.",
        "No, it’s not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!",
        "Yeah, it is! You wouldn’t have lost the ring, right? Y’know what, Ross you were right from the start, he (Chandler) should be your best man.",
        "Now, don’t argue with me…",
        "Really?",

        "They do me?",
        "I donīt sound like that.",
        "Okay, I donīt sound like that. That is so not true.",
        "That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!",
        "Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.",
        "Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?",
        "And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.",
        "Tyrannosaurus!",
        "Work people? Nobody told me.",
        "You know, I donīt get this. A month aga, these people were my friends. You know, just because Iīm in charge doesnīt mean iīm a different person.",
        "You think I should?",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay.",
        "I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing \"Ebony and Ivory\".",
        "What?",
        "Then, I donīt get it.",
        "They do?",
        "I just wanīt to--",
        "But I just wa--",
        "Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, Iīm gonna need them on my desk by nine oīclock.",
        "You have to give īem something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and whoīs the guy with the moustache?",
        "Petrie, right, right. Okay, somebodyīs gonna be working this weekend.",
        "Hey Ross, look what Iīve got going here.",
        "Yeah, like in a cab--",
        "Okay, hating this.",
        "Here we go, here we go.",
        "Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.",
        "Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.",
        "Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen, 'cause I like to be surprised.",
        "Hey, Rache, can I get--",
        "Not yet.",
        "So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.",
        "God?",
        "Well, maybe it was God, doing me.",
        "Well, you owe me one, big guy.",
        "He said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself without any outside help whatsoever.",
        "You have to really wanna see it.",
        "Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?",
        "No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.",
        "You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!",
        "Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.",
        "What stupid thing did you do?",
        "People do stupid things when they're upset.",
        "Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.",
        "Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?",
        "At least as long as I have the pants.",
        "Yo, paisan. Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man.",
        "Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.",
        "He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite--",
        "Cupping.",
        "Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.",
        "That's ok.",
        "You know, it's...something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back.",
        "We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?",
        "Carol, Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?",
        "So, uh, how often can you do it?",
        "Hey, sweetums.",
        "Come on, you're going to Bloomingdales with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.",
        "What did you just do?",
        "What did you just do?",
        "Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.",
        "Howdy.",
        "Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.",
        "What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.",
        "All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?",
        "You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.",
        "All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.",
        "Hey.",
        "I broke up with her.",
        "They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.",
        "I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.",
        "You or me?",
        "Maureen Rosilla.",
        "Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.",
        "Ok, Phoebe.",
        "Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.",
        "Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap",
        "Hey, look at this. \"My Big Book of Grievances.\"",
        "April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.",
        "Wow, he looks so normal.",
        "Funniest? Heckles?",
        "Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?",
        "Whoa!",
        "Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.",
        "I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?",
        "Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.",
        "Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.",
        "What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it \"supposably\"?",
        "How do you know that? How?",
        "You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?",
        "Yeah, I understand.",
        "You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.",
        "(on phone) Hi, it's me.",
        "Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?",
        "Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.",
        "Oh, my, god!",
        "Janice, you're--",
        "Is it--?",
        "Congratulations.",
        "You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?",
        "Neat. I'm gonna die alone.",
        "Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.",
        "If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, y=know. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. \"Run away from Crazy Snake Man,\" they'll shout!",
        "Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.",
        "In a bad way?",
        "Whoa! Don't know about that.",
        "Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.",
        "I'll take that.",
        "Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.",
        "Takin' that with you, huh?",
        "Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down.",
        "Sure. (My god, that's a big head! It didn't look this big in the office. Maybe it's the lighting. My head must look like a golf ball at work. All right, don't get hung up on it, quick, quick, list five things you like about her: Nice smile, good dresser...Big head, big head, big head!)",
        "[singing to the tune of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood] Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.",
        "Whoa, she's pretty.",
        "Oh, ok.",
        "Nice!",
        "For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.",
        "That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.",
        "Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.",
        "Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?",
        "Believe me, sometimes that happens.",
        "You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.",
        "Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.",
        "Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.",
        "Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.",
        "Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.",
        "Oh, yeah?",
        "[to an attractive woman] I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right? [The woman walks away]",
        "[to the woman who just rejected him] All right look. pen1s schmenis. We're all people. [She walks away again.]",
        "Isn't Ben in this?",
        "Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes.",
        "Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.",
        "Congratulations!",
        "Now we can finally watch Green Acres the way it was meant to be seen.",
        "So uh, which one is mine?",
        "[sits down] Ohh yes.",
        "[reaches for the footrest lever] Do we dare?",
        "Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild.",
        "Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both. But listen, don't ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, Geller-Green, they'll let you in, OK. If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you. OK, thanks. Pizza's on the way. I told you we wouldn't have to get up.",
        "I'll cancel the sodas.",
        "You got a Cheeto on your face man.[Joey removes the Cheeto and eats it]",
        "So how'd it go?",
        "Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.",
        "It's the Miracle Wax.",
        "Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice.",
        "Could you get us a couple of beers?",
        "She's one of us now.",
        "Well maybe he was nervous.",
        "Yeah. [feels the floor] Oh it's not warm yet, we still have time.",
        "I didn't know it was a big secret.",
        "You bitch.",
        "C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.",
        "Joey was in a porno movie.",
        "If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.",
        "Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.",
        "Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?",
        "No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.",
        "Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . . ",
        "Uh, Julie.",
        "Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright.",
        "What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.",
        "OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.",
        "Nice work my friend.",
        "Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.",
        "I got the time to get to know Julie.",
        "I'm goin' home.",
        "You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody.",
        "Can I uh see something? (Takes Ben. When he puts him close to Monica, Ben cries. When he moves Ben away, he stops crying.)",
        "Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat.",
        "We'll watch him.",
        "I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.",
        "You understood that?",
        "Is he the one with the beautiful wife?",
        "You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?",
        "No, I got him.",
        "Oh, seriously you want him?",
        "Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?",
        "Well, we are great guys.",
        "That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!",
        "(to taxi driver) Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.",
        "Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.",
        "You done?",
        "You know it?",
        "Oh, sure, they love us over there.",
        "Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.",
        "(on pay phone) Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.",
        "That's me.",
        "Actually, uh, we're both the father. (Puts his arm around Joey)",
        "Please tell me you know which one is our baby.",
        "Ok.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.",
        "What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?",
        "Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?",
        "All right, call it in the air.",
        "Heads it is.",
        "We have to assign heads to something.",
        "What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?",
        "(looking fearfully at Joey) Hey, he's not crying.",
        "You, you are gonna love this. ",
        "Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.",
        "And twenty-five it is.",
        "Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?",
        "Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.",
        "What's in the bag?",
        "Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.",
        "Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.",
        "Who said anything about Christmas?",
        "So whaddya got there Monica?",
        "Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?",
        "Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.",
        "Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time.",
        "Hey.",
        "Eeeshk.",
        "OK.",
        "OK. [reads paper] Brake left, gas right?",
        "[grabs for seat belt] Where's my seat belt?",
        "[Chandler gets in the back seat] Hey!",
        "Oh, so that's what this is for.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Alright.",
        "Alright, we're gettin' closer.",
        "Well, so why not go knock?",
        "Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.",
        "Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.",
        "Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!",
        "Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone. [Ross and Phoebe hug, Monica and Rachel hug, Chandler is left standing]",
        "OK, Phoebs, your turn.",
        "And, a lemon lime.",
        "And last but not least.",
        "Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there. (phone rings)",
        "No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.",
        "What?",
        "Bob here.",
        "(on phone) What've you been up to?",
        "Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. (to Ross) I love her.",
        "I'm back.",
        "Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?",
        "Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.",
        "I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.",
        "Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.",
        "Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.",
        "Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.",
        "Look guys, I know it's a little steep.",
        "But it's Ross.",
        "I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing.",
        "You know, I think I might just.",
        "Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.",
        "We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.",
        "All right.",
        "Hi.",
        "Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.",
        "Whoever stood you up is a jerk.",
        "I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?",
        "No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.",
        "Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. (to Ross) I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?",
        "Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.",
        "I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.",
        "Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?",
        "Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.",
        "You can tell us.",
        "We can talk about that.",
        "So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?",
        "No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.",
        "Together.",
        "So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?",
        "Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?",
        "By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.",
        "Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!",
        "If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.",
        "Why did you look at me when you said that?",
        "Fine.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had s*x today.",
        "Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.",
        "Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.",
        "I had s*x today. I never have to answer that phone again.",
        "Bob here.",
        "So, uh, you met someone, huh?",
        "So, uh, how was he?",
        "Eh?",
        "Well, that makes me feel so good.",
        "Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.",
        "So, let's go.",
        "Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.",
        "I can't believe the guys missed this.",
        "Chandler.",
        "Yeah, we really missed you guys.",
        "Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.",
        "I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.",
        "I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.",
        "Yes.",
        "No.",
        "Hey. Hold on a second. [shoots a goal] Huh?",
        "What's this?",
        "Well, I don't know what Big Leon told ya but it's an even thousand if you want me for the whole night. What is this for?",
        "Well, thanks man. Now I can get my pony.",
        "Wow, I don't know what to say. [opens the box and pulls out an incredibly gaudy gold bracelet] Wow, I, I don't know what to say.",
        "I don't know. It's a bracelet.",
        "[reads] To my best bud. [puts it back in the case] Thanks best bud.",
        "Oh, now? [puts it in his desk drawer] No, no, I think something this nice should be saved for a special occasion. [sets a chair in front of the drawer]",
        "I so am.",
        "Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track.",
        "Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight.",
        "Oh, she's goin' somewhere.",
        "Hey, you feelin' better?",
        "Ya know, the man's got a point. [gestures with his arm and the bracelet falls off]",
        "That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy.",
        "No, I'm alright, thanks.",
        "[walks over to the woman] I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.",
        "Chandler. [waves his arm around, exposing the bracelet]",
        "What? [realizes it was the bracelet] Oh this is excellent. You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap.",
        "Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. [Joey walks in behind Chandler]",
        "I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . [turns around and sees Joey] Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. [Joey turns around and walks out without saying anything] That's actually good.",
        "Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? [Joey doesn't respond] Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? [Throws a basketball to Joey. Joey doesn't move to catch it and the ball takes out a lamp] OK, that's my bad.",
        "Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?",
        "OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. [Joey goes to his room and shuts the door] Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . [notices the bracelet is missing from his wrist] wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there. [he starts searching the room, lifting up the couch cushions]",
        "I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . . [Joey returns to his room]",
        "I can't believe it.",
        "Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay. [sits down at the bar]",
        "What am I gonna do, huh? [Joey walks in behind him]",
        "Hey.",
        "Well this one's for you.",
        "No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, [puts bracelet on Joey] it's about you and me and the fact that we're [reading bracelet] best buds.",
        "That's what they'll call us.",
        "Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained.",
        "OK, I was wrong, that's what they used to cover Connecticut.",
        "Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?",
        "Work on your music?",
        "Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.",
        "So, whaddya say boys, should I call him? [squeezes the ear of one of the slippers and it barks] Well, ya know what they say. Ask your slippers a question... you're going crazy.",
        "Hey.",
        "Listen, I'm, I'm sorry I didn't make it over there today.",
        "Yeah well, I hear the place looks great.",
        "Oh hey, it's, it's terriffic. I mean it's a regular space... fest.",
        "Yeah I just... wanted to call and say hey.",
        "That's right my friend. It's time for...",
        "I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.",
        "Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?",
        "See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind.",
        "But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together.",
        "But...",
        "So uhh, how's the palace?",
        "Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news.",
        "Well, uh, why don't you ask him yourself. Joey, this is my new roommate Eddie.",
        "Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room.",
        "Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare.",
        "Hey Jo. When'd you start usin' mousse in your hair?",
        "Morning.",
        "Oh it's uh, over there on the table.",
        "No, Eddie likes to keep it over there.",
        "Oh, ooh.",
        "What?",
        "Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good.",
        "See ya. [Eddie leaves]",
        "Oh, I couldn't be happier.",
        "There's another carton right over there.",
        "Alright, so what's it about?",
        "Well I like both eggs equally.",
        "Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?",
        "Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?",
        "[stares in disbeliefe] Yeah o-, OK, alright. [oven timer goes off] Doesn't matter, time for Baywatch.",
        "You don't like that show?",
        "Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.",
        "Oh o-, OK man.",
        "[reluctantly sings] You're obviously not their favorite pet.",
        "Hey Eddie. Daahh!! What're you doin' here?",
        "Why?",
        "I can't sleep now.",
        "No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now.",
        "Hannibal Lecter...better roommate than you.",
        "I didn't realize that.",
        "GET OUT NOW!!",
        "Yes please.",
        "I want you out.",
        "Where did you hear it from before?",
        "Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here?",
        "Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?",
        "Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?",
        "Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...",
        "Your last roommate's kidney?",
        "Daaahhhh!",
        "Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching.",
        "Uuuh.",
        "Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.",
        "You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT!",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue.",
        "You want some help.",
        "[enters] Ding dong, the psycho's gone.",
        "Yes, yes I actually saw him leave. I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD!",
        "Our next cocktail party?",
        "Eddie, do you remember yesterday?",
        "Do you remember talking to me yesterday?",
        "So what happened?",
        "Oh sweet Moses.",
        "May I help you?",
        "Well, I'm, I'm sorry...[Eddie forces his head in the door] Ahhh. Have we met?",
        "I, I'm sorry, I uh [unchains the door and opens it all the way] I already have a roommate. [Joey turns around in the leather recliner]",
        "Yeah, he's lived here for years, I don't, I don't know what you're talking about man.",
        "Well I, I think we'd remember something like that.",
        "See ya. [shuts the door] Goodbuy you fruit drying psychopath. So you want me to help you unpack your stuff?",
        "Welcome home man. [they hug and jump around]",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Ah that's a cantelope.",
        "Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?",
        "I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?",
        "So is he housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place? Stay. Good, STAY! Good fake dog.",
        "God that is good TV.",
        "Phoebs, play with meeee.",
        "Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.",
        "Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.",
        "No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.",
        "We don't need to remedy that.",
        "That was so lame.",
        "So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?",
        "What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.",
        "Well it's not Sean Penn.",
        "Hi.",
        "Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler, can I take a message, or, or a fishtank?",
        "Oh, oh, c'mon in.",
        "Oh.",
        "Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my very soul.",
        "Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little...",
        "Bit country? C'mon in here you roomie.",
        "Bye.",
        "So, we gettin' a fish?",
        "Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.",
        "This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.",
        "Buddy?",
        "There was no fish when she dropped it off.",
        "Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie...[puts his hand on Eddie's shoulder] Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon? [picks up the fruit an tosses it to Eddie, it hits Eddie in the chest and falls]",
        "So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.",
        "Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.",
        "Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.",
        "Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.",
        "We're worried about you.",
        "We came over as soon as we saw.",
        "It's gonna be ok. You know that?",
        "I'm sorry man.",
        "Uhhhaahh.",
        "Yeah alright. What're these, raisins?",
        "[throws it across the room while Eddie's not looking] Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?",
        "[looks in the fish bowl to see a fish cracker] Well that's not an, even a real fish. No, that's a goldfish cracker.",
        "Ok, good night. [walks towards his room] You big freak of nature.",
        "That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.",
        "Waaa-aaah.",
        "The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.",
        "Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. [Joey gets a sheepish look] You used my toothbrush?",
        "Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.",
        "Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.",
        "Hey.",
        "Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?",
        "Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?",
        "Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?",
        "I know, this is a great apartment.",
        "Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.",
        "[being left behind] Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK.",
        "Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.",
        "Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.",
        "What?",
        "Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.",
        "Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.",
        "Well then maybe you should take it.",
        "Fine with me.",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah me too.",
        "Yeah. So do we need to hug here or. . .",
        "So I got ya something. [tosses Joey a bag of plastic spoons]",
        "Lick away my man.",
        "What?",
        "No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?",
        "Well I didn't think that was serious. [grabs the spoons back] Ya know I thought that was just a fight.",
        "Well, there you go.",
        "Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.",
        "I did pay for half of it.",
        "Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.",
        "Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.",
        "Stop talkin' to your men. [Joey scores]",
        "Congratulations. [Chandler leaves]",
        "Oh yeah, you got the big TV. We'll be over there all the time. . . [Chandler gives him a look] except when we are here.",
        "[quietly] Yeah, I remember.",
        "So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?",
        "Thanks.",
        "Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so.",
        "Well, I'm guessing uh, tonight at the coffee house.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster...",
        "No.",
        "Ok, you can have it. [He licks it and offers it to her.]",
        "That was there when I got here. [Takes a bite of his muffin.]",
        "Had it.",
        "Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.",
        "It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.",
        "Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.",
        "I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.",
        "Hey, how's the first day goin'?",
        "Well there you go.",
        "Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?",
        "Weird world. Your kids?",
        "Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.",
        "Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.",
        "Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.",
        "Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.",
        "Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.",
        "It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.",
        "Uh, if you say so sir.",
        "Well, I'm going to kill you.",
        "Why?",
        "Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?",
        "Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?",
        "Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.",
        "I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.",
        "Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.",
        "Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.",
        "Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.",
        "No freakshow, she's fictional.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Man, I am so beat.",
        "Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?",
        "Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?",
        "No actually, I was just going for colorful.",
        "What just happened?",
        "That, that is funny. Can I have it back?",
        "No?",
        "Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?",
        "No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.",
        "[both enter looking down] Hhhiiii.",
        "The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat.",
        "Ohhh [turns as if to hug someone] Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one.",
        "Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.",
        "Hey.",
        "Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?",
        "Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.",
        "Don't play with his things.",
        "You had to ask.",
        "I think you played the Gunther card too soon.",
        "Your cappucino sir.",
        "Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.",
        "CHANDLER:Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.",
        "Ok.",
        "No?",
        "Alright, hang on a second there Custer.",
        "Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back.",
        "Would you come on! Come on! [waitress brings their coffee] Thank you.",
        "Ah, there we go.",
        "You burn your mouth?",
        "Bullies, big bullies.",
        "Yes, we're standing out ground...apparently.",
        "Alright, let's do this.",
        "Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?",
        "Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it.",
        "Ok. [reaches in his pocket]",
        "Ok.",
        "Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the middle?",
        "Hey, hey, those guys are takin our stuff! [some guy runs off with the hat]",
        "Yeah, I wouldn't know having missed everything.",
        "Ok so, can I have my hat back?",
        "Huh. [reaches over and grabs the hat and bolts for the door but slips and falls behind the couch]",
        "Hi Monica.",
        "Guys guys, check this out.",
        "Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.",
        "Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.",
        "Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.",
        "Why her mom?",
        "Excuse me?",
        "This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?",
        "So, basically just a Chinese guy.",
        "Yes because uh, you look so young.",
        "NO! No, I'll take that for ya.",
        "Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?",
        "Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?",
        "Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.",
        "Alright you guys are off to party number one [ushers 3 guys into Monica's apartment] and you, you are off to party number two [ushers four women into his apartment. Two guys try to follow and Chandler blocks them and shoos them off to Monica's apartment] Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.",
        "Ok, they're coming, shhh. [Runs into Monica's apartment and grabs one last girl to take to his apartment]",
        "Well, we could count again.",
        "Look, are you gonna be ok?",
        "Well, actually just one birthday flan.",
        "It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.",
        "Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.",
        "Volleyball.",
        "Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.",
        "Ok, that's me. [runs back]",
        "[running out of his apartment after a girl] Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. [sits down beside Rachel] Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.",
        "Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.",
        "Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?",
        "I, I know. [Hugs her. Ross walks out and Chandler puts her in his arms.]",
        "Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?",
        "Sorry, we're on a major flan high.",
        "Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.",
        "Huh. (They all leave, dejected)",
        "Morning.",
        "Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.",
        "Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.",
        "I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.",
        "Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.",
        "Nope, not this time.",
        "I'm not yanking you.",
        "Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.",
        "(looks him in the eye) I'm not breaking up with her! (they stare at each other for a while, then Joey blows in his face)",
        "Hey!",
        "Of!",
        "You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?",
        "No, Janice.",
        "You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?",
        "Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!",
        "Well, there you go.",
        "Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! (Joey stares at him) Don't worry, those are the right letters.",
        "I want you to say that you like her!",
        "Thanks for trying. (grabs the ticket and starts to leave) Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!",
        "Umm, yeah.",
        "Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?",
        "We're not gonna talk about girth are we?",
        "Yeah, okay.",
        "Yeah! All right! You go first.",
        "Okay.",
        "Princess Leia in the gold bikini.",
        "I know!",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.",
        "And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....",
        "I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know...(Ross just stares at him). You don't know!",
        "You said...",
        "What are you guys doing together?",
        "Really.",
        "You still can't stand her can you?",
        "Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.",
        "Well, I guess that's something.",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh God!",
        "Really?",
        "Well, how do you find clothes that fit?",
        "Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. [starts poking Monica in the shoulder] 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'",
        "Ok, that's Eric.",
        "I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old [Monica gives him a glare] -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.",
        "Ok, this could be tough.",
        "Ooh, you almost had it.",
        "Hey.",
        "Your boyfriend is so cool.",
        "Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.",
        "You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car [passes the dollar back].",
        "I think they get it.",
        "There's the man.",
        "Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.",
        "Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.",
        "Yeah, didn't he tell ya?",
        "You hear that? We're the guys.",
        "[runs in] Hey, big guy, game time.",
        "Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.",
        "Kick save and... denied.",
        "Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.",
        "See, that's why we don't let her play.",
        "Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time.",
        "No.",
        "Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.",
        "No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work.",
        "You're not a dad. You're not a dad.",
        "I can't believe you got us into trouble. [slaps Joey on the arm. Joey takes exception and slaps him back]",
        "'Cause he was just so darn cute.",
        "Hey, what did your agent say?",
        "And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.",
        "I may have.",
        "Well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet.",
        "I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy...",
        "Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I did.",
        "It's like this, me, no jokes.",
        "Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.",
        "Joey, no means no!",
        "I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.",
        "Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim (sp?, I'm not an art guy) museum. See, she likes art, and I like funny words.",
        "(shyly) It means we're holding hands.",
        "I'm afraid I might just be.",
        "Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.",
        "How do you not fall down more?",
        "All right. (reading her answer) \"My husband is sleeping with his secretary.\" She's married! ",
        "I can't believe she's married.",
        "What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.",
        "What?",
        "Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband.",
        "Okay, I'll do it!",
        "Where is she, Where is she? (grabs Rachel) Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?",
        "(noticing a beautiful blond walking in) Ooh, oh, oh, that's her.",
        "Oh my God! (it's Janice)",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?",
        "Yeah!",
        "You’re building a post office?",
        "Okay. (notices that Joey is wearing some really tight jeans) My word! Those are snug.",
        "Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?",
        "All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.",
        "Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can’t get mad.",
        "Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit.",
        "I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.",
        "Peter Parker.",
        "(coughing) What a geek!",
        "Hi.",
        "We don’t, really.",
        "You know, we don’t really take advantage of living in the city.",
        "No, you didn’t get me!! It’s an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!",
        "I do NOT want this unit!!",
        "Fine! (goes into his room and slams the door, then he slams the bottom half of the door.)",
        "All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?",
        "Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.",
        "Eh, y'know what, she’s to political, she probably wouldn’t let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.",
        "Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she’s too international, y'know she’s never gonna be around.",
        "So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who’s gonna be in the country like all the time.",
        "(entering) Have you seen Joey?",
        "Oh, just this! (turns around and has a paint lid stuck to the back of his pants.) Y’know what it’s my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.",
        "What’s going on?",
        "Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!",
        "He started mine first!",
        "What, like a number?",
        "Hi! Bye! (runs to the bathroom)",
        "Okay, on three. One....Two....",
        "Why two?",
        "Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this ‘two’ talk.",
        "Okay, one...two...",
        "Oh, good job Joe.",
        "Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!",
        "Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how ‘bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours? (throws his shoulder into the center to try and move it, but it doesn’t move.)",
        "Umm?",
        "I’ve got five bucks says you can’t.",
        "Oh, I think I have the cash.",
        "Yeah, you got me. (picks up a 2x4 and puts it through the handles so that the doors won’t open) I’m out five big ones! (puts the money in the crack between the door and frame) Here you go.",
        "If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best.",
        "(to Janice) Don’t look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!",
        "What a wank!",
        "(leaning in) I’ll go.",
        "See, that’s why I could never be an actor. Because I can’t say gig.",
        "Knock, knock.",
        "Hey, I’m going for sushi does anybody want.. (enters and sees the bed) Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.",
        "Okay. (to Monica) It’s a racecar.",
        "Okay, well it this bed isn’t new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?",
        "You told him to play the boxer gay!!",
        "You totally screwed him over.",
        "Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! (makes a screeching sound as he pretends to stomp on the brakes.) Hey-hey good lookin’! (honks the bed’s little horn on the steering wheel.) Varrrrrrrrroom. (notices Rachel and stops) All right, I’ll leave. My bed’s so boring.",
        "You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!",
        "Well, it's official there are no good movies.",
        "Hey, man. What's up?",
        "Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.",
        "Is anybody else scared?",
        "Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!",
        "(entering with his ringing phone) Joe. Joe! Answer the\n          phone.",
        "Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to\n          have to see her tonight. (phone stops ringing) Oh, that's\n          great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.",
        "Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put\n          half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.",
        "Noo.",
        "No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And\n          this alarm started going off in my head: 'Run for your life!\n          Get out of the building!'",
        "I know, that, (looks at her fake chest, and loses his train\n          of thought, temporarily) that's why I don't want to go\n          tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.",
        "Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be\n          afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the\n          tunnel, to the other side! ",
        "Do we have any...(turns around and bumps Monica's fake chest)\n          Do we have any thoughts here?",
        "You think?",
        "Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a\n          gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.",
        "'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this. (hands her a present)",
        "Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is\n          to go into your brand new drawer. (gives her a drawer) See,\n          the drawer actually goes in my dresser.",
        "Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and\n          that's what girlfriends should, should get. ",
        "Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and\n          there's more. We should take a trip.",
        "Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna\n          meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!",
        "I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life\n          I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like\n          what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in\n          together.' and I'd be okay.",
        "It doesn't scare me!",
        "Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too\n          much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!!\n          (Janice leaves, Chandler then calls Janice to leave a message\n          on her machine) Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just\n          wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the\n          street. (runs out the door)",
        "So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship\n          is going to fast and we have to slow down.",
        "Then I got all needy and clingy.",
        "She said she'd call me.",
        "Oh God.",
        "This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.",
        "So, you don't think I'm terminal?",
        "Okay, okay. So, should I call her?",
        "So I'm not, not gonna lose her?",
        "I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'",
        "(in a British accent) Hello, Janice.",
        "(in accent) Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?",
        "(normal voice) No. Not anymore.",
        "Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some\n          things for a party. (grabs a bag off of the shelf)",
        "Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as\n          yours.",
        "Here in Chelsea.",
        "A woman's",
        "(shyly) Chelsea.",
        "Can I be that guy?",
        "....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at\n          her, and ran out of the store.",
        "I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good\n          ice cream now, right?",
        "(answering phone) Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a\n          second? Okay. (to Monica and Rachel) Okay, what do I do?",
        "Hello!",
        "What are you, stop naming dwarves! (on phone) Hello, Janice.\n          Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a\n          really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about\n          you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid\n          a couple of more times. I'm sorry. (listens) Really?!\n          (listens) Really?!",
        "(on phone) I love you too.",
        "(entering, with a goatee) Hey.",
        "I’m never gonna find a roommate, ever.",
        "Well let’s see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that’s plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!",
        "Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I’m not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone ‘Chandler Bing,’ he said ‘Whoa-whoa, short message.’",
        "Umm, how’s it going with you guys?",
        "Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?",
        "Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.",
        "Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you’re chances are pretty good. (Eric offers to shake hands) All right. (Chandler hugs him.)",
        "(running around the apartment pointing out things) Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, (opens door) Bye-bye.",
        "Sure. Ummm. What’s up?",
        "What gay thing?",
        "Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by.",
        "Hey, Mon.",
        "Do I ever.",
        "No way!",
        "Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?",
        "(to bartender) Can I get a beer.",
        "You betcha!",
        "Um-mm, yeah right!",
        "Oh yes, and that’s what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.",
        "Okay, but after that, we’re shootin’ some pool.",
        "Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.",
        "(picks it up) And now I’ve picked it up again. (walks over to Monica.)",
        "(leaving to go to work) Hey!",
        "Oh, don’t thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.",
        "So ah, whatcha watching?",
        "What’s it about?",
        "Well, it sounds kinda stupid... (looks at the TV) Who’s she?",
        "Wow! Look at them run.",
        "Yeah, I’ll go get one.",
        "Well, hello!",
        "Do you have any beers? We’re out of beers.",
        "You okay?",
        "Right.",
        "Noo!! You don’t have a boyfriend because....I don’t, I don’t know why you don’t have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.",
        "Oh-ho, come here. (goes and hugs her) Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I’ve ever known in real life.",
        "Umm, this is nice.",
        "No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?",
        "Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.",
        "Oh yeah, that sounds great. (starts to leave) Oh, and listen, it’s, it’s gonna be....",
        "Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross. (they shake hands)",
        "I can’t believe you came back.",
        "I will have one. (Ross and him both take one.)",
        "Okay, I’m not gonna have one.",
        "All right I’ll have one. (he and Ross take another\n          brownie,)",
        "See that is the problem with invisible dentists.",
        "That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I\n          look down the hygienist’s blouse.",
        "Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think\n          these pearls are nice?",
        "Janice’s birthday is coming up, I want to get her\n          something speacial. Come in here with me.",
        "That’s a good idea, ‘Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba\n          birthday’. I would like to get her something serious.",
        "All right. Look, I’m gonna go in here, and you don’t buy\n          me anything ever. (starts to go into the store)",
        "Why not?!",
        "What is the thing?",
        "(shocked) What?",
        "Well she, she wouldn’t do that, she’s with, she’s with me.",
        "Yeah, well, you’re wrong! Okay, you’re wrong.",
        "Ah, I don’t know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna\n          tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would,\n          tell me.",
        "You tell me! Maybe, it’s because I was just fooling with\n          my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!",
        "All right!",
        "Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.",
        "No! In his office! How many kisses were there?",
        "Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!?\n          There should be no kissing!!",
        "(giving her a bag) Here.",
        "I’ll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished\n          with me? (Janice shakes her head no) Are you finished with\n          him? (Janice shakes her head no) Do you still love him?\n          (Janice shakes her head yes) Do you still love me? (Janice\n          shakes her head yes) All right look, (grabs the bag) I’m\n          gonna need an actual answer here okay, so which is it, him\n          or me? (his phone starts to ring)",
        "Yeah.",
        "What?",
        "All right.",
        "I talked to Janice.",
        "She doesn’t know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I\n          woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy.\n          Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of\n          condoms. And now I can’t even return them, because she\n          choked on the reciept!",
        "I don’t know, y'know. What, what, would you do?",
        "Come on, tell me.",
        "What? (turns around quickly still ready to throw the dart\n          and Joey quickly ducks and hides behind the chair) What are\n          you, what are you talking about?",
        "Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you\n          to let me get through it, because it’s, it’s, it’s not gonna\n          be easy.",
        "I think you should go back with Gary. I don’t wanna be\n          the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents\n          split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see\n          him I was always think y'know ‘You’re the reason, you are\n          the reason why their not together.’ and I hated that guy.\n          And it didn’t matter how nice he was, or how happy he made\n          my Dad.",
        "Yeah, well. It’s the right thing to do.",
        "Then don’t leave me!",
        "Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!",
        "No you don’t! No, no, no, I say you have to give your\n          divorce another chance.",
        "Ohhh. Don’t go.",
        "No. No! No! No!",
        "I don’t care! (turns around and to the people watching\n          them) I don’t care!!",
        "You can’t leave! I have your shoe!",
        "(singing) ‘I’ll hold you close in my arms. (Phoebe enters) I\n          can’t resist your charms. And love....’",
        "(high pitched) ‘No you know I don’t mind.’",
        "‘I know.’",
        "‘I’ve found.’",
        "(entering) Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?",
        "I just saw Janice.",
        "Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid’s pretzel at them.",
        "Yes, but you ended up having s*x with both of them that afternoon.",
        "Oh, y'know what, I’m gonna be okay, you don’t have to throw a party for me.",
        "Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.",
        "Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it’s supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.",
        "Hello-dillillio!!",
        "(to Monica) Take off your shirt!",
        "Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.",
        "(to Monica) Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?",
        "Hi Joey’s sisters!",
        "Oh, I’m taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.",
        "No-no-no-no, no, it’s a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can’t we savor the precious moments? (to one of Joey’s sisters) Those are some huge breasts you have.",
        "Well, my apartment isn’t there anymore, because I drank it.",
        "Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.",
        "Ow, no ‘woo-hooing,’ no ‘woo-hooing.’",
        "Ah, I fooled around with Joey’s sister. (Phoebe gasps) Well, that’s not the worst part.",
        "I can’t remember which sister.",
        "Okay! You don’t think I thought of that?",
        "(to Monica) You see you can’t tell which one is which either, dwha!!",
        "Veronica. Look, it’s got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.",
        "Look, when I’ve been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I’m sorry.",
        "Why can’t we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.",
        "It’s gotta be the first one.",
        "Yep, I’m in a tree.",
        "Well, that’s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I’ll be in Cuba.",
        "What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?",
        "(shocked) Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?",
        "I’m here to see Mary-Angela.",
        "Where’s Mary-Angela?",
        "This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?",
        "Well, it’s, it’s yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?",
        "So um, Mary-Angela, what’s your second favorite?",
        "Would you just please....give me the receipt ‘cause this is great. It’s top notch.",
        "So will I.",
        "Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn’t mean anything.",
        "Will you excuse me I have to um..... (walks to the hall)",
        "(startled) Hey!",
        "Look, I may have jumped the gun here. (she tries to kiss him, but he ducks it and moves away) Um, I just got out of a relationship and I’m not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.",
        "Ahhhh, you’re not Mary-Angela.",
        "This is so bad. If-if you’re not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?",
        "Oh, this is soo bad. (doesn’t see Mary-Angela)",
        "No Joey! No Joey! Don’t Joey! Joey!",
        "(pats him on the shoulder) You’re it! Now run and hide!",
        "I wasn’t sure which one Mary-Angela was. (all of Joey’s sisters gasp) Look, I’m sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.",
        "Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother’s not going to punch me. (to Joey) Are ya?",
        "Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you’re my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.",
        "Okay, absolutely!",
        "You’ve got it. (he starts to look at his sister’s, but he still doesn’t know which one is Mary-Angela.)",
        "What?! (Cookie punches him)",
        "Don’t worry.",
        "(reading the comics) Eh..., I don’t, I don’t know.",
        "Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?",
        "(thinks about it) Yeah?",
        "Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.",
        "I was shrieking... like a Marine.",
        "(reading the paper) Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. (to Ross) Where exactly were around ten-ish?",
        "Look out kids, he’s coming! (Ross continues to leave with his head down in shame.)",
        "Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it’s the only chance to see New York.",
        "Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?",
        "How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?",
        "He’s right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.",
        "Because, I’m too afraid.",
        "Yeah, that’d be much worse than being 28, and still working here.",
        "(to Joey) Does this mean we’re gonna have to start paying for coffee? (Joey shrugs his shoulders.)",
        "I spelled out boobies.",
        "So, how many have you sold so far?",
        "Oh my God, how did you do that?",
        "Me! On my computer.",
        "Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.",
        "Something else I might have said?",
        "You-you-you don’t wanna give into the fear.",
        "Run, Joey! Run for your life! (runs out)",
        "Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.",
        "(to Rachel, who’s entering) Hey! How’d the interview go?",
        "Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.",
        "Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.",
        "It’s like ‘Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.’",
        "Sure, everybody loves a kidder.",
        "(to Ross) Should I tell her I ordered tea?",
        "I’m an alien. I’m an alien.",
        "Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.",
        "All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?",
        "I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.",
        "Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?",
        "(to Phoebe) It must take you forever to find your keys.",
        "(to Ross) Hey, so can you make it on Friday?",
        "Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.",
        "Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.",
        "Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! (pause) Don't cry outloud.",
        "I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.",
        "I'll get you the Cliff Notes.",
        "The abridgment.",
        "....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!",
        "Oh no, no, no, no.",
        "All right, I have to get that, but no-no. (answering phone) Hello? (listens) (happily) Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. (listens) Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? (listens) So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?",
        "Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.",
        "To yourself. (finishing) Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good.",
        "Bye-bye.",
        "What, what, what?!",
        "You really think that is what he meant?",
        "Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.",
        "Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.",
        "All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'",
        "He paints quite a picture doesn't he?",
        "Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. (holds up a pen) See, she's fully dressed, right?",
        "And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and (clicks pen) whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked! (Rachel just stares at him.)",
        "Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.",
        "Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some p0rn?",
        "Man, I gotta get a kid. (looks at the pen and starts laughing)",
        "Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.",
        "No, no, no, I don’t, I don’t really wanna play.",
        "That’s not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don’t say that I don’t have goals!",
        "Yeah, all right, I’ll play.",
        "No, no, no, you say that proudly.",
        "And was the curse lifted?",
        "But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won’t let me cross the street.",
        "And then Tineals.",
        "Wow! Just like in the pros.",
        "The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice. (goes to kick the ball but kicks Ross’s foot instead.)",
        "Sorry. I’m sorry. Y'know what, we’re just gonna throw it.",
        "No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.",
        "(coming up under center, just like a real quarterback does, and puts his hands between Ross’s legs.) Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! (Ross stands up and looks at him) You wanna go shotgun?",
        "(from the shotgun) Hike!",
        "Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.",
        "No, no, no, no, no!",
        "(running up) Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna.. (sees Marhan) Hi, I’m Chandler.",
        "Mar-haaaan.",
        "Well, that went well.",
        "Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.",
        "Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.",
        "Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn’t I wouldn’t have a shot?",
        "Math!! You’re giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we’ll see who gets her.",
        "Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.",
        "Hey! Well, I’ve been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that’s mean!",
        "Before!!",
        "Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?",
        "Okay, good.",
        "(to Margha) Hi.",
        "No-no-no-no, the game’s not over, we’re just switching teams.",
        "No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?",
        "And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?",
        "Fine with me.",
        "Yes!!",
        "Well, you don’t you have Captain Hook explain it to her.",
        "You hear that! That is her chose, mister I’ll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!! (does the wave.)",
        "Wh-what?",
        "Y'know what, it doesn’t matter, ‘cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!",
        "We’re not gonna lose to girls.",
        "Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!",
        "Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you’re five feet short, so we win!",
        "Guys! Guys! Come on! It’s Thanksgiving, it’s not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, (to Joey) the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!",
        "Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.",
        "Yeah, baby!",
        "Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?",
        "Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she’s celebrating that by going on a date with him.",
        "Oh, hey.",
        "(to Robert) So ah, isn’t a bit cold out for shorts?",
        "Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.",
        "(standing up) I’m up! I’m up, I’ve gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?",
        "Okay Ross, why don’t you come with me?",
        "Robert’s coming out.",
        "No. He.....he’s coming out of his shorts.",
        "The man is showing brain.",
        "(to Ross) Wellll?",
        "What do we do? What do we do?",
        "Like an eclipse.",
        "Your liking it, huh?",
        "No, actually Laurie’s a boy.",
        "Hey.",
        "You mean a three pointer?",
        "I’m sorry, I’m sorry, it just seems that Robert isn’t as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.",
        "Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!",
        "Hmmm, that’s very cool.",
        "I can’t believe she cracked your code!",
        "No, Beth doesn’t die, she doesn’t die. Does she Rachel?",
        "We can’t tell him, you can’t go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.",
        "Yeah, we got, um-hmm.",
        "Oh my God! Oh my God!",
        "Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?",
        "He’s right. Nobody’s gonna benefit, and you’re just gonna hurt her.",
        "All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing’s right. And that’s what deathbeds are for.",
        "Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac’s sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe’s friends with Rachel. And that’s the trail, I did it!",
        "Off?!!",
        "Yeah, well I don’t think you can make that statement, unless you’ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.",
        "Oh, that’s mature.",
        "Nothing, nothing.",
        "Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....",
        "(to Joey) He has s*x, and we get hit in our heads.",
        "Uh-oh.",
        "She was not good. Not good.",
        "Uh-oh.",
        "Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.",
        "Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.",
        "(handing Monica the wax) Wax the door shut, we’re never leaving, ever.",
        "Oh great, food with hair on it.",
        "Because that would be crazy?",
        "Yeah, come on, it’s Ross and Rachel, they’ve got too.",
        "What?",
        "Are you actually saying these words?",
        "Let’s go.",
        "(to Joey) Is that your new walk?",
        "(entering) Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I’m going down to the Xerox place.",
        "Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.",
        "Yeah! You wanna come?",
        "Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!",
        "Uh-oh.",
        "(to Joey) Okay, that hurt us.",
        "Well ah, ........y'know.",
        "All right, rock on. (Does the ‘Hang 10’ sign, then hides his face in shame.)",
        "Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?",
        "What time is it now?",
        "Yeah all right, so we’ll hang out.",
        "Yes. Vividly.",
        "Yeah, I-I-I think so. (Pauses and thinks about it for a second) Yeah, I-I think so...",
        "Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?",
        "She was kidding.",
        "She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.",
        "Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there.... (holds his arm out and pretends to grab something with his hand.)",
        "Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.",
        "Well it you don’t know that, then I don’t want to do this with you.",
        "And that’s the only colour that comes in.",
        "So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.",
        "Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.",
        "Hey, this isn’t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!",
        "Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.",
        "Why? What happened to him?",
        "I like her.",
        "Well, that’s pretty much all I’m looking for from these people.",
        "(to Ross) All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I’d like know whether that’s several big fish or just one big fish.",
        "No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called ‘wait until the last moment before I burst and die.’",
        "Jeez, man did you fall..(sees it’s a beautiful woman coming out of the men’s room) Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?",
        "(to Gunther) Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I’m-I’m talking to ah, (tries to get her to say her name). (to her) This is the part where you say your name.",
        "Ginger. I’m talking to Ginger, so....",
        "Nope, nope, I’d just ah, I’d rather talk to you. (pause) Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom. (knocks on the door)",
        "Well, that’s the best kiss I’ve had with anyone I’ve ever met in a men’s room.",
        "(sees her foot is in a slush puddle) Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.",
        "Yeah, we’re gonna have to get you out of those shoes.",
        "No, really you’re gonna freeze.",
        "You’re not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.",
        "Great. It was great. She’s ah, she’s great, great looking, great personality, she’s greatness.",
        "Joey told you about the leg, huh?",
        "Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn’t have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don’t want to stop seeing her, but every so often it’s like ‘Hey, y'know what, where’s your leg?’ I mean I’m the smallest person in the world aren’t I? I’m the smallest person in the world.",
        "(to Monica) Actually he’s the smallest person in the world.",
        "It came up.",
        "No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?",
        "No. No. I don’t think so.",
        "That’s-that’s my nubbin.",
        "It’s kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.",
        "Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... (starts to kiss her again, but she gets up.) Ahh, what?",
        "You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?",
        "(entering, happily) Well hello!",
        "The doctor.",
        "Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.",
        "That was an obvious joke, and I didn’t think of it. Why didn’t I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!",
        "This is the New York Times.",
        "We are. He’s meeting us here.",
        "Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.",
        "Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn’t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.",
        "Y'know what maybe it’s gonna be okay, I mean it’s been a week.",
        "No.",
        "Yes, yes, it’s just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.",
        "Yeah, he’s really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.",
        "(jumps back and points at the cigarette) Oh my God!",
        "Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I’m, I’m smoking still.",
        "Look, I’m telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.",
        "Yeahhh. I’m tellin’ ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....",
        "Oh that’s great, with my luck, that’s gonna be him.",
        "Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism. (answers the door and it’s Rachel again.)",
        "Hey, shut up!! You’re not my real Mom!!",
        "Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.",
        "Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.",
        "(to Joey) Well he’s probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.",
        "What?",
        "Beam me up Jesus.",
        "Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.",
        "Oh, come on, there’s a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.",
        "Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.",
        "Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!",
        "(to Joey) My lighter’s in there! (points to the cab)",
        "Damn! (stands up) The tailpipe’s not hot enough to light this!",
        "Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.",
        "Ladies, ladies, let’s just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica’s bra.",
        "Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.",
        "Okay, now let’s decide who has the nicest ass.",
        "At least let me smoke it to the good part.",
        "I have the lung capacity of a two year old. (starts to light another cigarette.)",
        "Well it’s very unsettling.",
        "Oh no, now it’s not gonna make any sense!",
        "Oh, this is horrible, it’s just horrible.",
        "It’s horrible.",
        "Y'know what, I can handle it, handle’s my middle name. Actually it’s the ah, middle part of my first name.",
        "Guys, guys, guess who I am?! (starts dancing around in an effort to stop the fighting.)",
        "I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.",
        "Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.",
        "Okay.",
        "No-no, why don’t you hang on to that one.",
        "Okay, that’s like the least fun game ever.",
        "Oh. (takes the cassette and puts it on his arm like the stop smoking patch, and it falls off.) Nope, that patch is no good. (Joey and Monica both do their fake laughs.)",
        "Or what my Father called Thursday night.",
        "Y'know, I would’ve bet good money that he’d be the first one of us to get married.",
        "Always illegal Joe.",
        "If that doesn’t keep kids in school, what will?",
        "(entering, carrying a briefcase) Hi.",
        "Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?",
        "Y'know what, pretty good.",
        "Good! I haven’t smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.",
        "Thanks",
        "What check thing?",
        "(reading the check) Pete Becker. Pete… (quickly grabs a magazine and opens it up to show her a picture) (pointing to the picture) Is this him?",
        "Who’s he huggin’?",
        "This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!",
        "There you go!!",
        "(to the girls who are staring at him) What?",
        "(in a feminine way) Oh my God! (and he jumps all around)",
        "Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.",
        "Okay, then get the lobster!",
        "Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.",
        "Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?",
        "Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?",
        "Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.",
        "It’s possible. You are very loveable, I’d miss you if I broke up with you. (Ross glares at him) I was just trying to be supportive.",
        "(in a deep voice) If I broke up with you, I’d miss you.",
        "And you’re our age. You’re our age.",
        "That’s not a state Joe.",
        "You’re our age!",
        "I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn’t matter, I still wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It’s so annoying. Does it bug you?",
        "Is there any chance you didn’t see that?",
        "Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can’t just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You’re gonna get peep eye!",
        "You didn’t just break up.",
        "You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!",
        "Okay.",
        "And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.",
        "Stop what?!",
        "No!! You can’t!!",
        "I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! (Ross is now dragging Chandler and the foosball table to the door) You are surprisingly strong!",
        "Look man!",
        "Listen to me!! (Chandler turns him around and closes and holds the door shut with his feet.)",
        "She’s moving on! Okay, if it’s not this guy, it’s gonna be somebody else! And unless you’re thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It’s over.",
        "Okay.",
        "I know. (He rubs Ross’s head)",
        "I don’t think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. (He blows on his hand) Draw!! (He quickly pulls the lever to raise the foot rest, like a gunfighter in a Western.)",
        "(to Joey) I wasn’t doing anything. (Joey starts angrily throwing his stuff down.) Uh-oh, what did she do now?",
        "Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.",
        "I think somebody has a crush on somebody.",
        "I’m talking about you. You big, big freak.",
        "Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you’d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!",
        "‘Cause it’s-it’s not his last name.",
        "No, it’s not like, like Phil Spiderman. He’s a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there’s no Gold Man.",
        "So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?",
        "What about things that are already gold?",
        "Okay, let’s play my game now.",
        "Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!",
        "My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh, that’s-that’s okay, no problem. (He starts to look around her office.)",
        "Yes, I realise that.",
        "That’s the stuff! (quickly grabs it)",
        "Thanks, it’s ah, Gaelic, for ‘Thy turkey’s done.’ So ah, I’m gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.",
        "Hello.",
        "(holding a tissue) And is this in case the house sneezes?",
        "Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.",
        "Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin’ out the Chan-Chan man!",
        "Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I’ll do it.",
        "(entering) Hey, my Father’s house does that!",
        "Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there’s nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.",
        "Of course, I didn’t get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna’s such a big, dull dud!",
        "(entering with Rachel) I’m telling ya, Joanna’s got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, ‘This was fun. Let’s do it again sometime. I’ll give you a call.’",
        "That’s what you say at the end of a date.",
        "To her face? Look it’s the end of the date, I’m standing there, I know all she’s waiting for is for me to say ‘I’ll call her’ and it’s just y'know, comes out. I can’t help it, it’s a compulsion.",
        "Multiple, so many paper cuts.",
        "(sarcastic) Oh, well give me the phone then.",
        "Look, you can’t call somebody after this long just to say, ‘In case you didn’t notice, I don’t like you!’",
        "Nooo!! She’s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!",
        "All right! Fine! But it’s just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don’t want you setting me up with anybody ever again!",
        "That’s just a lot of big talk, y'know.",
        "It’s not a big deal. It’s, just it’s right here, (points to his eye) and it’s all the time.",
        "(He looks over at Rachel, who nods her head) Yes, this, this was pleasant.",
        "The food there was, was great.",
        "So take care.",
        "Well, this was great. I’ll give you a call. We should do it again sometime. (Rachel is disappointed)",
        "Noo!",
        "Look, I’m sorry. Okay? I’m weak, and pathetic, and sorry.",
        "Ahhhh—I’m not going to call you.",
        "I’m sorry. I’m-I’m-I’m sorry that I said I was going to when I’m not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn’t Rachel’s fault. It’s me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, (pause) mascara goop. And I’m really sorry, it’s just that this is not, this isn’t going to work out.",
        "Yeah, o-okay.",
        "Well this is great! I’ll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!",
        "Ye-e-es!!",
        "Who’s number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.",
        "Bye!",
        "Yeah, and I don’t have any cologne.",
        "Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.",
        "(entering, carrying the chick and duck) Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?",
        "Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.",
        "(seeing Joey) There he is!",
        "Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.",
        "I know.",
        "So that’s the girl you like.",
        "Wait a minute, wait a minute, you don’t like the guy Rachel’s dating? Well, that’s odd.",
        "Could I borrow it?",
        "Oh-ho-ho-ho.",
        "7:15. (Monica looks at him) Watch doesn’t work.",
        "Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like, (claps his hands) banging his hands together!",
        "Ross, don’t. Ross!",
        "Ohh, that’s a good one.",
        "Why don’t you use ours across the hall, ‘cause she…has…problems.",
        "Step away from the duck.",
        "And yet, she’s still not hanging up the phone.",
        "(to Monica) (in a funny voice) Hi there. (Monica turns her head away in disgust)",
        "(jumping up) Oh, I’ll go out and get you some.",
        "Nope! Because I’m not your boyfriend. (to Phoebe, who’s entering) Hey Pheebs, how did it go?",
        "I found a dried up seashores.",
        "All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?",
        "I’ve got canned goods.",
        "Excellent hole, Joe.",
        "Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!",
        "We’ve got to do something!",
        "Y'know what, he’s right. There’s something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.",
        "Me too!!",
        "Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I’m gonna break up with you!",
        "Look, Ross, you have what you want, you’re back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you’re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.",
        "(jumping up) Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!",
        "I’ll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.",
        "(running over and joining Monica) They’ll never understand!",
        "(following Monica) We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn’t think we could make it. (He goes to put his hands on Monica’s shoulders but for some reason can quite complete the action and pulls back.)",
        "And then Joey remembered something.",
        "(wails loudly into his hands) Joey kept screaming at me, “Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!” Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.",
        "(entering with Joey) (to Monica) Coffee house?",
        "I KNEW IT!!!!",
        "We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.",
        "Okay. All right.",
        "Do you think that there’s a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as you’re driving into town there’s-there’s like a sign, and it says “You’re in Sample.” (He says it like urine sample.)",
        "Yeah, it’s two guys in a ring, and the rules are: “They’re are no rules.”",
        "Yes, but there’s two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.",
        "Oh it’s Bing, sir. I’m sorry , I was just ah...",
        "All right buddy, way to go! (smacks him on the butt)",
        "Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.",
        "Well, I didn’t do anything. I didn’t want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.",
        "Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between ‘em.",
        "(to Ross and Monica) What if Joey were president?",
        "(to his co-workers) What is with him?",
        "Well, that’s not true, he-he smacked you once.",
        "No sir.",
        "(joining them) Hey! Which one’s my turkey burger?",
        "Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it’s gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I’m conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.",
        "Excuse me, Doug? (no reaction) Hey there sports fan!!",
        "No, I ah, I didn’t do them.",
        "No, no I just ah, didn’t do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don’t deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.",
        "Doug!!",
        "I’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.",
        "No, no. It-it’s not about the swearing, it’s more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.",
        "Oh, and don’t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It’s just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it’s making all the other guys jealous.",
        "Okay. (he starts to leave)",
        "Ahhhhh! (walks out, imitating shooting himself in the head)",
        "Thank you, sir.",
        "No. No, not at all, that’s-that’s ridiculous.",
        "Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!",
        "Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!",
        "Or... Dick.",
        "Was it like a sneeze only better?",
        "No!!",
        "Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! (sees it) Huh.",
        "No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a…",
        "Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.",
        "Hey!",
        "Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.",
        "You're right, I know.",
        "(joining them) Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?",
        "Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.",
        "Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.",
        "Well sensitive is important, pick him.",
        "(sitting down on the couch) I-kea! This is comfortable.",
        "So, what do you thing the good news is?",
        "Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He’s not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that’s like a third or fourth date kinda thing.",
        "Oh, so you’re going with the teacher, huh?",
        "(comforting the duck) Everything’s gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?",
        "(to Bonnie) So ah, your first sexual experience was with a\n          woman?!",
        "Tell it again. (pause, we see Rachel is not amused.)\n          Seriously.",
        "(reading the back of the picture) Me and Frank and Phoebe,\n          Graduation 1965.",
        "You’re not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster\n          cook.",
        "Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I’ll be your\n          boyfriend.",
        "Why is that so funny?",
        "Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend\n          material?",
        "Okay, so we’ve established my name, and hit me. But\n          theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren’t friends, say\n          it’s a blind date. I show up at your door, and I’m like (in\n          a fake voice) \"Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey.\"",
        "Hey!",
        "What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat!\n          They did experiments on me! I can’t have children!!",
        "Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?",
        "Big bullies!!",
        "Hey!",
        "Bored and bored!",
        "Yes!",
        "Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.",
        "So, you still don’t think I’m boyfriend material?",
        "I saw you checking me out during the game last night.",
        "Yeah, well, lucky for you.",
        "I don’t know.",
        "Oh, yeah, I don’t know what they were doing, but at one\n          point sea turtles actually came up to the house.",
        "Where ya going?",
        "(to Joey) Noo!! I don’t care! I’m not, I’m not gonna playing\n          one-on-one strip poker with you for practice! ",
        "G’night.",
        "Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don’t need\n          that kind’ve hurt. Take it from a guy who’s never had a\n          long term relationship......",
        "Ahhhh! (Steps away from her.)",
        "Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.",
        "There is not one hair on that head.",
        "(in a fake voice) Hi there.",
        "Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you’re gonna wanna date\n          this next guy, I swear!",
        "Hi! I’m Dorf! You’re date for the evening. (Monica walks\n          away in disgust) Oh come on! Dorf on dating, that’s good\n          stuff!!",
        "Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!",
        "You don’t turn and slide, you throw it out! I’m tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!",
        "All right, how about we, how ‘bout we sell it.",
        "(nods his head) Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? (to Joey) They seem all right with it!",
        "Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.",
        "(reading the ad) Stunning entertainment center. Fine, (pause) fine Italian craftsmanship. (Joey is very proud of himself)",
        "You want it?",
        "Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?",
        "All right look, I’m changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.",
        "(looks at him) Nooo.",
        "I can’t believe you don’t know what I do for a living!",
        "(interrupting) Let it go!!",
        "Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.",
        "You’ll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.",
        "Y'know, I, I really don’t think we need a canoe.",
        "All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!",
        "Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he’s wrong.",
        "Oh-no, he’s right.",
        "I’m coming already!!",
        "OH MY GOD!!!",
        "Are you all right?!",
        "(lets him out) What happened?!!",
        "What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!",
        "So--You got in voluntarily?!",
        "BEND OVER?!!!",
        "Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!",
        "Oh, they said uh, “You don’t have insurance here, so stop calling us.”",
        "Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we’d really appreciate it. (Joey nods in agreement)",
        "Oh no-no-no, I’m, I’m paddling away!",
        "Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!",
        "Could we be more white trash?",
        "Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.",
        "Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.",
        "(laughs) No. No!",
        "Well, not at first.",
        "Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.",
        "Oh, come on! It’s not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I’m pretty much just in there by myself.",
        "Okay, I promise, I’ll end it.",
        "I hope you know what I’m giving up for ya, because she’s not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.",
        "…it was like the Algonquin kids table. (They all laugh, but Joey only laughs not to be left out.)",
        "It just doesn’t…feel like we’re breaking up.",
        "Okay.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Okay. (Starts to button up his shirt)",
        "I’m getting dressed.",
        "When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.",
        "What is it?",
        "Ah-ha, you’re not the boss of me. (She kisses him) Yeah, you are! (She handcuffs him to the chair) Ooh, saucy.",
        "You are, you’re gonna leave me like this?",
        "Okay. But if you don’t come back soon, (She leaves and closes the door) there’s pretty much nothing I can do about it!",
        "Hi! (to Sophie) How are you?",
        "Hello, Joanna…(Realises he doesn’t know her last name)…’s office.",
        "How little?!",
        "Look, this isn’t funny! You get back here right now!",
        "Why not?!",
        "What?!",
        "(in a serious, businesslike tone) Rachel, could I see you for a moment?",
        "Okay, here’s the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.",
        "I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!",
        "It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.",
        "No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can’t get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I’m cold, and (Stops and looks up the skirt on a statue behind Joanna’s desk.)",
        "Never!",
        "Fine!",
        "I—never borrowed your Walkman.",
        "You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! (Rachel goes over and unlocks the handcuffs) Ahhh! (He starts rubbing his wrist)",
        "No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. (He runs over to where his pants are hanging) Hello sweet pants!",
        "About what?",
        "I’ll make something up! I’m good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!",
        "Oh-ho-ho, I don’t think so!",
        "Well, this is much better.",
        "Hey, look, you’re in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she’s gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.",
        "It still wouldn’t be clean. (Rachel makes an ‘Eww, disgusting!’ face) All I want is my freedom.",
        "Freedom!",
        "Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won’t you here me?! (Opens the door) Sophie, help me! Help me!! (Sophie stands up)",
        "I’m gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just… (He moves his arm which opens the drawer and hits in the back of the head, which proves his point.)",
        "No!",
        "With extra pulp?",
        "No!",
        "You don’t have it.",
        "How do Monica and Phoebe know?",
        "(intrigued) Go on.",
        "And Milton Berle has a…",
        "(hello) Hello.",
        "(to Rachel) I love you. (Kisses her on the forehead)",
        "(checks his watch) Two hours, that lasted!",
        "I think so.",
        "Could there be more Kims?",
        "Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn’t say ‘cool’ anymore.",
        "Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I’ve missed the last 1200 times.",
        "You don’t think I’ve tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.",
        "Oh Maria. You can’t say no to her, she’s like this lycra spandex covered gym…treat.",
        "No!",
        "Oh no, you’ll have to come.",
        "Why don’t you just give him to somebody else?",
        "Because that’s the only part of you he can see when he’s on the table!",
        "Yes. (In a stronger voice) Yes!",
        "No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!",
        "Okay. (They go inside) (To the guy at the desk) I wanna quit the gym.",
        "I wanna quit the gym.",
        "(He turns to Ross and Ross makes a ‘Be strong’ sound.) I wanna quit the gym.",
        "(horrified at the prospect of trying to quit alone and unsure about himself) I wanna quit the gym.",
        "Hey.",
        "No, I almost did, couldn’t leave Ross there without a spotter!",
        "We’re doomed. Okay, they’re gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?",
        "You’re a genius!",
        "Now, there’s two reasons.",
        "Thank you, Joey.",
        "Hi.",
        "No, we’d just like to close them.",
        "I wanna quit the bank!",
        "To pay for the gym.",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah… Bunny-rabbit.",
        "Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.",
        "I could die.",
        "I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.",
        "Hey! (Phoebe sneezes)",
        "All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?",
        "(gets up) (softly) Wish me luck.",
        "Wish it! (To the woman, Kathy, he likes) Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?",
        "Uh Kathy, with K or a C?",
        "Oh-oh-hey!",
        "Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.",
        "Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey. (Joey kisses Kathy.)",
        "Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.",
        "(sees Kathy is up watching TV) Hi!",
        "Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.",
        "Oh my God! That's why I got up too!",
        "Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...",
        "So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.",
        "That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.",
        "Is it on?",
        "Hey! (Runs over and gets his wonder broom)",
        "Oh! It's on! It's on!",
        "There we go little fella.",
        "Well the duck can swim.",
        "Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.",
        "She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?",
        "No, I don't.",
        "Thank you, Ross.",
        "All right.",
        "All right.",
        "Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! (She doesn't hear him and keeps running, Chandler starts chasing her as the theme to The Mod Squad starts to play. First, a car almost hits him and then gets mustard splashed on him as he runs by a hot dog vendor.) Kathy! (He keeps running and gets tangled up in the leashes of five dogs, in desperation he throws his paper.) Fetch! Fetch it! (He frees himself and resumes the chase) Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! (He now trips and falls into a pile of garbage, he tries to get up and scream her name again but he has a piece of spinach in his mouth. He gets out of the garbage and starts crossing the street by running over the hoods of a couple of cabs.) Kathy! (He jumps in front of her and out of breath he says) Kathy.",
        "Oh, I just wanted to say, \"Hey!\"",
        "Okay. (He walks away disgusted with himself.)",
        "(entering) Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.",
        "I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. (he waits for a reaction, when he doesn't get one) No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!",
        "Really?!",
        "(laughs) Right in there!",
        "99...100! Ready or not, here I come! (He opens his eyes and sees that the chick and the duck are still sitting in front of him) All right, let's go over the concept one more time.",
        "Hey!",
        "Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.",
        "Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.",
        "You-you do?",
        "You got me.",
        "Yeah. Right.",
        "Okay.",
        "Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.",
        "Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.",
        "Uhh, no-no thanks.",
        "Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer. (Leaves)",
        "What?",
        "Hey, look, what do you want from me?",
        "I am pretending.",
        "Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? (Joey gives him a thumbs up) No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!",
        "Can I sleep on your couch?",
        "(sporting a goatee) Hey.",
        "Oh, so that’s why the priest threw holy water on me.\n          (there’s no reaction from Joey) Okay, listen, you have to\n          cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean\n          anything is better than sitting around here crying all day\n          about Kate.",
        "Hey.",
        "No way!",
        "Oh my God! Who’s gonna watch that?!",
        "Yeah. (they start to leave)",
        "Thanks. (He takes off the vest and throws it on the floor.)",
        "So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did\n          it take for the roller skating thing to happen.",
        "Okay, so I guess that’s about ah, two weeks before the\n          topless thing kicks in.",
        "Hey!",
        "Okay. (He opens it and it’s a baby chick) It’s a chicken.",
        "Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.",
        "Easy Lenny.",
        "Okay, but this is the last time. (singing) With a chick-chick\n          here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick,\n          everywhere a chick-chick-(Joey enters)-chickeeeen.",
        "Hey.",
        "She?",
        "I don’t know. (He picks the chick up and turns it over,\n          trying to determine the s*x of the chick, and blows on it.)\n          I can’t tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.",
        "Excuse me?",
        "I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so\n          somebody could be here with our chick!",
        "You don’t think I get up when you get up?",
        "Yes, here it comes! I’m stuck here all day, and then you\n          come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go\n          off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don’t think so\n          mister!",
        "And you don’t think taking care of our chick is work?",
        "I know what you meant!! (pause) You notice that ever since\n          we got this chick, we’ve been fighting a lot more than we\n          used too?",
        "I’ll take her back tomorrow.",
        "Hey!",
        "(rushing in) Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a\n          chick out of a VCR?!",
        "I know. See, yes. That’s Yasmine Bleeth, she’s a completely\n          different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very\n          different ways.",
        "Hey!",
        "I did! But the store wouldn’t take her back! So then I took\n          her to the shelter, and you know what I found out? ",
        "If they can’t find a home for her, they kill her! And I’m\n          not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!",
        "Okay. And it’s not just chicks y'know? It’s all kinds of\n          other animals!",
        "Thanks, I’m glad you see it that way.",
        "Ohhh-hoo, funny story!",
        "Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you\n          did!!",
        "That’s a bad duck!!! (to Ross) How’d the thing go tonight,\n          Ross?",
        "(to the duck) Okay, now when you come back I hope you\n          remember that, that chick is not a toy! (He goes back into\n          the apartment)",
        "(coming out of his apartment and seeing Ross) What did you\n          do?",
        "Having a swim.",
        "Chicks don’t swim.",
        "I don’t know. Should we try it?",
        "See, I told you they don’t swim. (He goes to take it out)",
        "Noo! (takes him out) Oh, it’s okay, it’s okay, baby, baby,\n          baby.",
        "Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.",
        "Where did you, when did you, how did you... (Joey hits the back of Chandler's head) How did you get a girl like that?",
        "Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.",
        "Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?",
        "Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.",
        "Well, I have a call in about that.",
        "Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.",
        "Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.",
        "Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.",
        "It doesn't say that. Does it?",
        "Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.",
        "It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. (Kathy goes into the bathroom.) Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?",
        "(confused) Sure...",
        "I don't know... um, Grease?",
        "Rent?",
        "Okay, so when do you want to go?",
        "Yes, it is, at Office Max.",
        "A pen.",
        "Huh-huh! You can't give her that.",
        "Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!",
        "All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?",
        "For three years?",
        "All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?",
        "Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?",
        "Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.",
        "Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called \"Invisible things for Kathy.\" (Motions to an imaginary pile of presents next to him.) Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?",
        "She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.",
        "Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?",
        "Where?",
        "I got something for her. (Joey picks up the package, shakes it next to his ear, can't hear anything, switches ears, shakes it again.) It's a book!",
        "No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?",
        "No, it came out to an even twenty.",
        "Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?",
        "Oh yeah? That's great!",
        "[nodding, with mixed feelings] Aahhuuhhh....",
        "Hey! Happy birthday.",
        "No he didn't. [Moving it back.]",
        "Happy birthday! I'm sorry.",
        "See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.",
        "Oh, yeah... yeah.",
        "[to Kathy] Goodnight.",
        "Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.",
        "Uh, the book?",
        "What do you mean?",
        "(tongue-tied) Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, \"Uhl, ell.\"",
        "Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.",
        "Goodnight. (Goes to his room.)",
        "(entering in a bathrobe) I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!",
        "It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it’s bad enough that I’m in love with my roommates girlfriend—which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we’re in the room together there’s this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I’ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she’s smooth! Smooth! (leaves)",
        "(rushing up) Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?",
        "Goin’ out, huh? Wow! Wow! (Does a little celebration dance) So things didn’t work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.",
        "(shocked) What?",
        "Wait! You’re going out with Kathy!",
        "Well, I’m upset—for you. I mean, having s*x with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (He can’t believe he just sad that.)",
        "Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she’s-she’s smart, and funny, and gets you.",
        "All right look, I think it’s time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.",
        "All right! Bring it on, you…",
        "(interrupting) Oh my God! Play!",
        "Really, bitchin’!",
        "You mean like, music?",
        "Yeah, I know what you’re thinkin’! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.",
        "Come in!",
        "Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.",
        "No-no, he’s not back yet, but he’ll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?",
        "I like it in the stern. (Realizes what he just said.) …of the boat. (The phone rings, and he answers it.) (on phone) Hello.",
        "What happened?",
        "Why can’t you tell her?",
        "Joey! Joey!!",
        "I thought your time ran out.",
        "(to Kathy) Uhh, that was Joey. He’s running a little late, he says he’s sorry.",
        "So I guess it’s just uh, you and me then.",
        "Yeah, I think it is!",
        "Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut…",
        "…and then it got canceled.",
        "Really?! You do that?",
        "Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don’t make my tail too poofy.",
        "Well, thanks. I grow it myself. (Kathy is running her fingers through his hair, and Chandler catches himself enjoying it too much.) Y’know who also has great hair is Joey!",
        "What-what ‘cha doin’?",
        "‘Kay.",
        "(jumping up to answer the phone) Oh the phone! The phone’s making sounds! (On phone) Hello!",
        "Hey it’s Joey!",
        "What?",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh yeah man. (to Kathy) Joey. (Hands her the phone.)",
        "Yeah. Yes! Yeah.",
        "Oh.",
        "No-no-no-no, this is bad! It’s bad! This is bad!",
        "Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?",
        "Okay!",
        "Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here’s what we do, we-we forget it happened.",
        "Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we’re unhappy forever. Sound good?",
        "I have to; he’s my best friend, and you’re seeing him.",
        "(interrupting) Oh-no-no-no! Don’t! Don’t! See-see, you’re getting me confused, I’m starting to urn.",
        "I-I think we have too.",
        "Bye. (Kathy leaves and Chandler wonders over to and leans up against the door.) Are you still out there?",
        "Hang on buddy! (He goes over and unlocks the door and opens it to reveal a fully furnished apartment.)",
        "I sure did.",
        "Well, I just thought it’d make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.",
        "Oh no-no-no. This is amazing. (He goes over and presses a button on a remote control that opens the entertainment center doors revealing the TV.)",
        "Well, y’know I’m 29. I mean who needs a savings account.",
        "Oh, I don’t know.",
        "You mean with Casey.",
        "Or Casey.",
        "Could be Casey.",
        "Consider Casey.",
        "That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!",
        "I kissed Kathy.",
        "No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he’ll understand this?",
        "Oh, don’t say that! Don’t say that. That’s not true. Is it?",
        "Then why didn’t you tell me to do that?!!",
        "God!! (Sits down in disgust.) What am I gonna do?!",
        "Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!",
        "Yeah, I know.",
        "Hey!",
        "Is that a real thing?",
        "Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.",
        "It’s-it’s about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.",
        "Yeah.",
        "What?",
        "Oh uh, when?",
        "Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?",
        "Yes, but I-I uh, don’t have too.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.",
        "See uh, that’s-that’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.",
        "It’s me. I’m the other guy.",
        "Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and…",
        "No! No! No! I just kissed her.",
        "How is that worse?!",
        "Look, I’m sorry! But there’s nothing I can do, I think I’m in love with her!",
        "You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.",
        "Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!",
        "Probably because…",
        "Our eyes are closed and we’re about to cross the street. Very good.",
        "(entering) Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?",
        "No-no, I don’t think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!",
        "Kathy’s with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!",
        "I’m gonna call and get off work tomorrow!",
        "This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!",
        "Oh man! I am so excited—I may vomit!",
        "Look you don’t understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y’know you’re never know what’s gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!",
        "Oh yeah, it’s beautiful country up there.",
        "It’s not gonna be exactly like last time.",
        "Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!",
        "(answering it) Hello. (listens) (to Ross) It’s Gandolf!!! (on phone) So, are you in town? (listens) (disappointed) Oh, well, well maybe next time then. (Hangs up)",
        "He’s not gonna make it, he’s stuck in Chicago.",
        "Stupid, useless Canadian money!",
        "Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.",
        "Oh-no, y’know with Gandolf we’d be out all night!",
        "And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?",
        "All right!!",
        "Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?",
        "Well, those were seals, man.",
        "Yeah, all right.",
        "Actually, me too.",
        "Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?",
        "Y’know what? We’re not sad, we’re not sad, we’re just not 21 anymore. Y’know? I’m 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!",
        "You!",
        "Well the vet seems to think that’s she’s becoming a rooster. (The rooster crows.) We’re getting a second opinion.",
        "Oh, I can uh, check that for ya.",
        "I can check that for ya.",
        "Well… we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.",
        "(to Rachel) And you… Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel’s bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.",
        "Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.",
        "(to Ross) Stop that now!",
        "Yes!",
        "Diet soda.",
        "Orange juice.",
        "Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh! (Whispers something in Joey’s ear.)",
        "I got it! Scotch… tape. (They’re right.)",
        "Well, we used there’s up last night making scary faces.",
        "All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.",
        "Fears and Pet Peeves.",
        "His legs flail about as if independent of his body!",
        "She has a real name.",
        "Althea?! What are you doing?!",
        "You're shooting with Althea?!",
        "Nice shooting!",
        "Actually, it’s Miss Chinandolor Bong.",
        "Unfortunately that is correct.",
        "I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we’re gonna destroy you.",
        "Well, I’m so confused as to what we’ve been doing so far…",
        "Say 200?",
        "(interrupting) All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds.",
        "But if we win, we get your apartment.",
        "Okay. (Starts jumping around.)",
        "Dangerous Liaisons.",
        "Oh! (Whispers something in Joey’s ear and then in Ross’s ear.)",
        "Fancy.",
        "Fancy guest.",
        "Thanks man.",
        "You can’t just call Monica’s room.",
        "Oh, I would never bet this apartment. It’s too nice.",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah, but I bet it works.",
        "Well believe it baby!",
        "I knew it!",
        "Cool, girl roommate.",
        "Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!",
        "What?! What-what is it?!",
        "I can’t believe we live here!",
        "I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black. [stops]",
        "Blue blazer *back*. He, he wants it *back*.",
        "Well, you, you know what I meant.",
        "[Chandler glares at her and then changes the subject.] So what job did you get Joe?",
        "You're going to carry their child and get them a Sony Play Station?",
        "Oh, yeah, sure. It's not mine anyway. It came with the pants.",
        "Yes. Right where?",
        "Yeah, you've, you've got to love the talking.",
        "Oh, we haven't had s*x yet. Okay, but what's the big deal, you know? This is special, and I want our love to grow, before we move to the next level.",
        "No, he's right, I'm totally lying.",
        "Well, Kathy's last girlfriend was Joey.",
        "No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him.",
        "Yes and I was saying the actual words.",
        "We share a wall. So either he's great in bed or she just liked to agree with him a lot.",
        "Yeah?",
        "[gets up to leave] All right, all right, I'll sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys. [leaves]",
        "[enters] Hey. Why's Phoebe singing to Karl Malden?",
        "[dejectedly] Yes, yes, we had the s*x.",
        "It was fine, you know, but she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, uh, \"Oh, I see your point. I'm all right with it.\"",
        "Look, you have to help me, okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman. I know where everything goes. It's always...nice. But I need to know what makes it go from \"nice\" to \"My God, somebody's killing her in there!\"",
        "You don't have to draw an actual wo -- [looks at Monica's drawing] Woah, she' hot.",
        "[shocked] There are seven?",
        "[points to diagram] That's one?",
        "Oh, you know what, I was looking at it upside down.",
        "And that's bad?",
        "Well you might if it were anything like seven.",
        "Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?",
        "Were you so late because you were burring this woman?",
        "How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie? (laughs, at they all look at him) That joke would’ve killed in Albany.",
        "Hey, look at this! (Holding a newspaper) They’re lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.",
        "All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can’t believe I missed it.",
        "Really?! I didn’t think girls ever just wanted a fling.",
        "Y’know what? There’s some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?",
        "Well, I have a girlfriend, I’m-I’m happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.",
        "Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?",
        "Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who’s boss.",
        "(he glares at him for a while) Yes.",
        "I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? (Drew looks at him) Og-ee-op, I’m not asking for me, I’m… I mean… No, I’m-I’m not gay, I’m not asking you out. I’m not-I’m not-I’m not gay!",
        "See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.",
        "Oh, y’know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.",
        "(to Drew) Oh, by the way, that is her full name.",
        "Oh well, that’s uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!",
        "Well, I don’t really know what that is, but let’s!!",
        "(entering) Hello, children!",
        "(to Rachel) Have I got the 50 guys for you!",
        "Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They’re buying me drinks! They’re giving me stuff! (to Joey) Knicks tonight?",
        "Wherever! I’ve got like 20!",
        "Y’know what, I’m gonna uh, play the field just a little more.",
        "Guys are signing over their 401-K’s to me?",
        "(pause) Yes. (to Rachel) Okay, there’s this one guy, Patrick, I think you’re gonna like him, he’s really nice, he’s funny, he’s a swimmer.",
        "Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.",
        "See, I’m not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?",
        "Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.",
        "It’s a big company, I don’t—if you—I…",
        "Oh yeah! With who?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hey, man!",
        "Well, like father, like son.",
        "Really?! I-I thought you weren’t looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.",
        "Ummmmmmmm, no.",
        "Why not?! I’d be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get—oh I see.",
        "(interrupting) Oh, y’know, y’know what Pheebs?",
        "I’m not Jewish, so…",
        "Bad dream?",
        "Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe’s song about?",
        "Prague?",
        "I did! I absolutely did!",
        "I’m sure you’re right, but why?",
        "Oh, man. I’m sorry, I’m so-so sorry.",
        "I know! I know!",
        "Well, y’know, you’re-you’re gonna meet somebody! You’re a great catch! Y’know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn’t have to lie once. (He sits down on the arm of her chair)",
        "Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?",
        "Oh, it doesn’t matter. (Kisses her on the top of her head.) Hey, y’know what, I’ve got two tickets to tonight’s Rangers game, you wanna come with me?",
        "Well, actually it’s a hockey team, so it’s angry Canadians with no teeth.",
        "Have you ever been with a woman?",
        "So there is no good time to ask that question.",
        "Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have s*x with the star of the play!",
        "I know!!",
        "Wow! She looks great. Doesn’t she?",
        "Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!",
        "Yeah, it’s like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!",
        "I’m totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they’re gonna go to their cast parties and he’s gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it’ll be like, \"So where’s your boyfriend, what’s-his-name, Chester?\" And she’ll go, \"No-no-no, it’s Chandler.\" And he’ll go, \"Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!\"",
        "All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?",
        "Really?",
        "So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?",
        "Yeah, I know but…",
        "Okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I’m fairly certain are the same thing.",
        "I’m right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there’s no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!",
        "Come on, it was like cousins having s*x up there!",
        "Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you’re having s*x with him.",
        "Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!",
        "Y’know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you’re up there every night, you’re naked, touching, kissing.",
        "Well, you can understand, given how we started.",
        "Well, that is what happened, and I don’t even see you denying this!",
        "Yeah, well, don’t expect that to happen anytime soon!",
        "Steps! (He opens the door to his apartment to Ross and Joey looking at the new Playboy) Slut! (Ross and Joey quickly hide the Playboy behind their backs. Chandler wonders into the girl’s apartment.) You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!",
        "I confronted her, and she didn’t deny it! (Pause) I don’t live here! (Goes back into his apartment and they all follow him.)",
        "Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie’s…",
        "Yes! See you and I have always been like—(motions that they think the same.)",
        "Did she call?",
        "All right, maybe I should call her.",
        "Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?",
        "Well y'know, what if she didn’t actually sleep with the guy?",
        "She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!",
        "That’s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.",
        "Oh my God!!",
        "Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I’m sorry. Y’know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.",
        "Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y’know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? ‘Cause we’ve had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y’know, I know for me—(Notices a pair of men’s pants on the chair.) Nick’s pants?",
        "Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!",
        "Well, she wasn’t sleeping with him.",
        "She is now.",
        "I’m saying that she… is a devil woman! Y’know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don’t hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.",
        "Because, I-I should’ve called! Y’know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would’ve gone out with Nick, and they would’ve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!",
        "(on phone) Hey, it’s me. I know you can’t stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I’d try and apologize over the phone. All I… (Joey hangs up the phone in disgust.)",
        "Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I’m… (Joey hangs up the phone again.)",
        "(entering) Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!",
        "They couldn’t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.",
        "Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, ‘cause I wanna trade for her.",
        "Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?",
        "Oh that’s not true! That’s not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it… (notices the look on Monica and Phoebe’s faces.) Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it… (Phoebe looks confused.) Her initials…",
        "Op, y'know what though, it’s kind’ve a girlie briefcase.",
        "Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!",
        "Thanks.",
        "Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.",
        "Well maybe you should put some ice on it.",
        "He’s really picky about his patients.",
        "(entering) All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! (Ross is pleased.) I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.",
        "Oh y’know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.",
        "I don’t know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.",
        "Oh no-no-no, you don’t want to do that, then you’re gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.",
        "Like?",
        "When was the last time you saw her wear it?",
        "Big dog?",
        "I walk into a room and he won’t even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.",
        "Hey Joe.",
        "Hey! I’m sorry! That—(sees that Joey is about to leave) where are you going?",
        "Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?",
        "What?!",
        "Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I’ll stop seeing her?",
        "Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!",
        "All right look, if you’re not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!",
        "What?",
        "All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. (Joey looks intrigued) What?",
        "(He is now in the box, in their living room.) Sounds like a really bad idea to me.",
        "The meaning of the box is three fold. One (holds a finger up through the air hole), it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two (holds up another finger), it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three (holds up a third finger), it hurts!",
        "Air hole! Air hole!! (Ross retracts his hand quickly.)",
        "How do ya do.",
        "What happened? What happened?!",
        "Gotcha! (laughs)",
        "Sorry!",
        "Okay, okay, you got it!",
        "You can’t tell, but I’m trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!",
        "You’re right, and I’m sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won’t say another word tonight.",
        "Absolutely!",
        "So?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Man, this is…",
        "You said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!",
        "That’s a mailman! That’s our mailman! (Waves to the mailman) (Sarcastic) Hi. How are ya?",
        "Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?",
        "(entering, with Janice in tow) Hello!",
        "Isn’t this amazing?",
        "Okay. Bye.",
        "Bye.",
        "Bye.",
        "B-bye!",
        "Bye. (Finally closes the door on her.) (After it’s closed) I can’t stand the woman! (Phoebe is shocked, Joey is relieved.)",
        "Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality—Well, they’re all back! Y’know? And she’s picked up like nine new ones!",
        "Don’t worry about it. I’m taking care of it tonight. (Chandler opens the fridge and grabs something to drink.)",
        "(standing in the door of the fridge) Well, I don’t have to break up with her this time. We’re not involved! I’m going to do a pre-emptive strike! I’m going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen! (Closes the fridge.)",
        "Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.",
        "(laughs) Okay, we have to talk. I’m just getting out of a very serious relationship…",
        "Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.",
        "I hear ya. (Pause) But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!",
        "No! No! Not, Paris.",
        "Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? (Thinks) Yemen. That’s right, yes, I’m being transferred to Yemen!",
        "I don’t know exactly.",
        "But I do know that it’s some time tomorrow.",
        "Y’know uh, you didn’t really have to help me pack.",
        "Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!",
        "Oh, I’m packing. Y’know I’m-I’m packing ‘cause I’m moving to Yemen tomorrow.",
        "I’m only going to pretend I’m moving to Yemen, it’s the only way I can get rid off her.",
        "(to Janice) Okay. (to Joey) Joey, trade lives with me!",
        "(from his bedroom) Thanks!",
        "Y’know you, really didn’t have to take me to the airport.",
        "Well, we’re really not that close. (Pause) Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.",
        "Okay. Then I guess it’s just, wait here then. (Hands her the sign that says, Wait Here.\") (To the ticket agent) Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.",
        "Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.",
        "What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?",
        "No. All right, y’know what, she’s (Points to Janice) gonna think that I’m handing you a credit card, but what I’m really gonna do is hand you a library card.",
        "(to the ticket agent) American Express?",
        "Well, I-I guess I gotta go.",
        "Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.",
        "Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.",
        "No!",
        "Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!",
        "Well, I then guess I’m going to Yemen! I’m going to Yemen! (To this old woman also going to Yemen.) When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?",
        "Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.",
        "What are you writing?",
        "Oh yeah? (He grabs the pad and starts reading it.) Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you (Pause) never go out of style—what did you throw away?",
        "Hi guys!",
        "Without me?!",
        "Yes, but in Ross’s case, they both know in two weeks that’s it.",
        "Maybe that’s because soy-burgers suck!",
        "What are you talking about?",
        "Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there? (Points to the living room.)",
        "Like what?",
        "I said, \"Like what?\"",
        "Does for me.",
        "Flashdance.",
        "She was a welder.",
        "What are the odds? What are the odds?",
        "Okay.",
        "There’s a Phoebe on my sandwich! (He walks away, giving the sandwich to Phoebe.)",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh-ho, yeah!",
        "You don’t have to stop having fun just because I’m here. Kathy didn’t cheat on all of you. (To Joey) Well, except you. (They hug and Chandler goes into the bathroom with the chick and duck following him.)",
        "(opening the bathroom door and kicking out the chick and duck) Would you give me one minute!! Please.",
        "Y’know, I can’t believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I’m never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!",
        "That’s right! Where are the guys? I’m ready to get drunk and see some strippers.",
        "They got a breakfast buffet.",
        "Ooh, let me talk to him!",
        "Well, can I just…",
        "She’s shhing me! It’s my phone and she’s shhing me!",
        "Ow!",
        "Maybe, she doesn’t hit him all the time.",
        "Okay, I’m going to go stand over there. (Points and moves into the living room.)",
        "So y’know, uh, when’s he getting back?",
        "Y’know, I knew something like this was going to happen. (He starts to take off his pants, revealing that he is still wearing his sweat pants.)",
        "Yes you can. You’re thinking about time, you can’t go back in time.",
        "(laughs) No you can’t.",
        "You don’t want to be guys, you’d be all hairy and wouldn’t live as long. (Starts to go to his bedroom)",
        "Okay. (Starts to cry)",
        "No thanks, Mom!",
        "Ahh, come on! Y’know what—y’know what, I think I’m just gonna go home and call Kathy.",
        "No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I’m gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, I’m gonna get so drunk, I’m gonna wanna call Janice",
        "Ohhh!!",
        "Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!",
        "All right, well I’m gonna put my sweats back on.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Stripping!",
        "Okay, look, I’m gonna have to ask you all to leave.",
        "Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn’t picture myself with any of them. (Sits back in disgust.)",
        "(jumping up) Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!",
        "I am totally picturing you with all those women!",
        "Well, I’m there too!",
        "Stop it! You’re killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!",
        "Where I don’t want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have s*x with strippers and my friends!!",
        "Come on, let me see that smile.",
        "Please?",
        "I know, I know, but you’re gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.",
        "All right ladies, here’s what we’re gonna do. (Points to a stripper.) You are gonna take off my clothes. (To another two strippers) You two, go get the oils. (To another stripper) And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, \"Chandler’s the king! Chandler’s the king!\"",
        "Oh, that’s fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.",
        "Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!",
        "What do you want from me, I’ve never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, I’m sorry you can’t stay, (Rachel is upset about leaving the orgy with the cigarette guy.) but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. (The cigarette guy starts rubbing Chandler’s back.) What are you doing? (The guy just nods) All right, listen, I’ve got to wake up!",
        "Treeger’s snaking the shower drain.",
        "Hey!",
        "Do we pay for this?",
        "Maybe we shouldn’t pay our phone bill—free phone s*x.",
        "Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!",
        "Like finding money with naked people on it!",
        "(stopping her) Oh no-no-no-no!",
        "We don’t know what could make this go away.",
        "And no one touches the air around the TV!",
        "Oh no-no-no! (Monica mutes the TV and they tentatively look behind them)",
        "We still have p0rn.",
        "Or a job where you don’t have to carry a table.",
        "It’s the theme from Good Will Humping.",
        "Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?",
        "They don’t really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.",
        "Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?",
        "All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it’s over.",
        "What?",
        "Okay. (Pause) Good one.",
        "Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a p0rn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.",
        "Because then we would be the guys who turned off free p0rn.",
        "Pregnant Woman Slays Four?",
        "What’s the second part of your plan?",
        "You put your fist through the wall?",
        "A place where no one will ever get out alive?",
        "Are we in London?",
        "Hey.",
        "I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn’t ask me to go do it with her in the vault.",
        "What, no, \"Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?\"",
        "Y’know what, we have to turn off the p0rn.",
        "All right, ready?",
        "Two.",
        "Yeah, that’s kinda a relief.",
        "You wanna see if we still have it?",
        "FREE p0rn!!!",
        "We have free p0rn here!!!",
        "It could’ve been worse, he could’ve shot her.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh wow, I hope you don’t take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I’m just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.",
        "Seven times!",
        "In a foreign, romantic country…",
        "Bad London! (Takes a spoon and smacks the turkey.)",
        "Well, I don’t see that we have a choice. But, when we’re back home, we don’t do it.",
        "Y’know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs…",
        "Okay!",
        "Forget it, that’s off.",
        "The man’s got a point.",
        "Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, \"Yippee!\" just ignore me.",
        "Oh, hello Rachel.",
        "Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.",
        "Yeah, we’ll be down in like five minutes.",
        "Oh, yay…",
        "(To Monica) Hey, listen, why don’t we go change in my room?",
        "Wow, you look…",
        "Well, I’ve got a girl in here.",
        "Well, we’re-we’re hanging out in here!",
        "Well, I suppose I’d have to say you!! But, what if we’re watching a movie in here?",
        "Well, Ross and Emily aren’t gonna use it.",
        "Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects s*x. The room would be disappointed if it didn’t get s*x. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.",
        "Okay!",
        "Nope, not under here!",
        "Well, you couldn’t have looked everywhere or else you would’ve found her!",
        "Yeah, for about 30 minutes.",
        "Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. (Monica smiles at that.)",
        "Yeah, we’re gonna go.",
        "Yeah, it’s a very large plane.",
        "But, we’ll stay here with you.",
        "We have to leave for New York in an hour.",
        "We can’t do that that’s insane. I mean ‘A’ he could wake up and ‘B’ y’know, let’s go for it.",
        "Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. (Realizes something) Y’know, technically we still are over international waters.",
        "‘Kay!",
        "Uhh, no.",
        "No.",
        "Yes.",
        "Okay man. (Chandler starts to get up.)",
        "Hey!",
        "No we didn’t!",
        "Yes! Good thing we have that, ‘Not in New York’ rule.",
        "Right.",
        "Oh. Y’know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn’t because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me ‘cause, you’re really hot! Is that okay?",
        "And I’m cute too.",
        "Thank you! (They hug.) All right, I gotta go unpack.",
        "Bye.",
        "(entering) I’m still on London time, does that count?",
        "Oh, good! (They start kissing.)",
        "Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.",
        "All right.",
        "Wouldn’t that be Frank the III?",
        "Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?",
        "Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.",
        "Hey, y’know what, if you’re gonna do that, if you’re gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. (Phoebe doesn’t think so.) Oh, come on! Chandler’s funny, sophisticated, and he’s very loveable, once you get to know him.",
        "Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he’ll be there. And he’ll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you’re really hot.",
        "Hey!",
        "And now you’re giving me the message!",
        "You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?",
        "Hi! Hi! You’re crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.",
        "Raymond Chandler.",
        "Okay, there are no famous Joey’s. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.",
        "Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he’ll never be President. There’s never gonna be a President Joey.",
        "Wow, you’re, you’re right. I have a horrible, horrible name.",
        "Okay.",
        "No, no, you’re right, it is a ridiculous name!",
        "Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.",
        "I have no name.",
        "Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.",
        "Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?",
        "It’s Clint. It’s Clint! (He heads for his bedroom.)",
        "It’s Clint! Clint!",
        "(entering) Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?",
        "All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.",
        "Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it’s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women… So, as of 4 o’clock tomorrow, I’m either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.",
        "(pleased) Really?!",
        "Okay. Thanks.",
        "You wanna hug it out?",
        "Yay!",
        "Okay!",
        "Bye, Pheebs!",
        "Ha! Ha! Ha!",
        "Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!",
        "Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?",
        "Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please? (Gunther starts to pour him another cup.) So uh, what do you do when you’re not working here?",
        "Oh, okay, thanks. (He goes back to the couch and rejoins Monica, Joey, and Phoebe.)",
        "Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I’m exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!",
        "It’s not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!",
        "They don’t have those.",
        "Next time you snore, I’m rolling ya over!",
        "Hey, all right!",
        "Oh, she’s got you running errands, y’know, picking up wedding dresses… (Laughs and makes like Indiana Jones and his whip) Wah-pah!",
        "Y’know, whipped! Wah-pah!",
        "That’s what I did. Wah-pah!",
        "All right buddy, time to roll over. (Rolls him over, and discovers a surprise) (Looking down) No-no! (Covers his eyes) No, no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a clinic! You’re going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!",
        "It’s 6:00.",
        "Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that’s, I think that’s really cool.",
        "What?",
        "Yeah, well, I don’t dance at weddings.",
        "Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like this… (Starts to dancing really, really, really badly. Ross enters behind him and he stops.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Nothing.",
        "What?!",
        "(answering for him) Yes he did.",
        "(waking Joey) Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!",
        "You’re coming on to the entire room! (He goes over to pick up a stack of magazines next to her, and to get her attention, he throws them back down.) I’m Chandler.",
        "Hi.",
        "You mind if I…",
        "So uh, what are you in for?",
        "What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.",
        "(entering) Hello! Little ones.",
        "Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. (They’re stunned.) Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.",
        "Because I’m cooler.",
        "Well she’s, she’s the kinda girl—Joey was unconscious.",
        "Plus, you look cool.",
        "That's right.",
        "Oh no.",
        "Okay.",
        "Hey! You okay?",
        "Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?",
        "All right…",
        "Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.",
        "Really? Male nurses?",
        "So they're going on dates? When?",
        "This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?",
        "All right.",
        "(spotting her) Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!",
        "Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.",
        "Fine! Maybe I will too!",
        "So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?",
        "Oh.",
        "Sure. (Pause) And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way. (Retreats in defeat.)",
        "(to another female nurse) Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?",
        "All right. Very good.",
        "Bye, momi-moo.",
        "Yes!",
        "Oh God, kindergarten flashback.",
        "Okay, keep saying it!",
        "So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?",
        "Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary… Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing s*x and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.",
        "Really? Okay, so…",
        "Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?",
        "Right!",
        "So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?",
        "That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?",
        "Ho! Ho! Ho!",
        "Your pants!",
        "Santa pants. (Phoebe still doesn’t get it.) Santa Claus’s pants.",
        "Uhh, a T-shirt that says, \"I don’t belong here.\"",
        "Yeah we do!",
        "Are you serious?",
        "Forget it! Okay, I’m not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!",
        "No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.",
        "(ignoring him) Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?",
        "Forget it! Okay, I’m not giving up the apartment.",
        "Oh my God!",
        "You do know that Wham broke up?",
        "Where is Emily?",
        "Man, didn’t she like just get here?",
        "Easy tiger.",
        "So what are you going to do?",
        "Are you serious?",
        "Because you’ve only known her for six weeks! Okay, I’ve got a carton of milk in my fridge I’ve had a longer relationship with!",
        "And I love the milk! But, I’m not gonna some British girl to move in with me! (Realizes that made no sense.) Joey, you say things now.",
        "Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.",
        "No thank you.",
        "Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can’t leave in the small apartment after we’ve lived here! Didn’t you ever read Flowers for Algernon?",
        "Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.",
        "Screw the Knicks!",
        "I didn’t mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.",
        "And the Knicks rule all.",
        "No. No. We’re not gonna do that, y’know why? Because its not an even trade.",
        "No!",
        "Op, op, I’m convinced!",
        "All right, but you can’t use that again for a whole year. I’m in.",
        "Okay!",
        "Fine, let’s do it.",
        "Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first",
        "That’s a low one!",
        "Why are you screaming and hugging?",
        "Yeah baby!",
        "Tickets please! (Rachel hands over the tickets) That’s courtside baby!",
        "No they didn’t!",
        "Those were like the best seats ever.",
        "Oh yeah, that’s very nice. Plus, y’know they were free and they’re too small.",
        "Oh. Oh, God! (He starts running around like a chicken with his head cut off.)",
        "I KNOW!!!",
        "Open up! Open up! Open up!",
        "What the hell is going on?!",
        "We are switching back, right now!",
        "Well, you’re gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we’re switching it back! There’s nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?",
        "What?",
        "I don’t care, this is our apartment! And they stole—you stole it—our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I’m getting back right now!",
        "Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can’t offer anything to us!",
        "Totally worth it!",
        "Good night.",
        "Okay!",
        "Oh, well, that’s great!",
        "Ehh, you're just liquored up.",
        "I've had a very long, hard day.",
        "Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.",
        "For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!",
        "Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.",
        "Hey Joe!",
        "Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in",
        "Hey, Pheebs!",
        "Uh, The Wheat Chief.",
        "Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story.",
        "I can't believe she can out run you man!",
        "Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.",
        "Oh that's not true.",
        "Okay, I gotta go to work.",
        "And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.",
        "Pheebs! (He goes over and kisses Phoebe, who is also stunned.) Always a pleasure. (And he struts out leaving the girls to stare at each other.)",
        "All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?",
        "I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.",
        "So, thanks for having me over! Rach. (Goes over, grabs her, and kisses her.) Pheebs. (After a moment while he decides how to kiss her around her belly, grabs her and kisses her.)",
        "Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea. (Gets up to leave.)",
        "I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.",
        "Hey, Pheebs!",
        "Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little… Y'know, it didn't have any… It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!",
        "Atlantic City!",
        "Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!",
        "I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.",
        "Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having s*x.",
        "No.",
        "Okay. (They kiss again.)",
        "Y’know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.",
        "Phoebe is, making people.",
        "And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!",
        "No-no, not something stupid, something huge.",
        "Why not?! I mean it’s just, it’s just climbing! It’s just, it’s just steep!",
        "We’re going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!",
        "Yeah baby!",
        "(dejected) Yeah, well…",
        "Yeah, we could do that without y’know risking our lives at all!",
        "(dejected) Oh, well…",
        "Yeeeeahhhh.",
        "But I’ll tell you something. One of these days we’re get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!",
        "And I just want a million dollars! (EXTENDS HIS HAND HOPEFULLY)",
        "Uh-oh.",
        "She was not good. Not good.",
        "Uh-oh.",
        "(entering) Hello!",
        "(sarcastic) Noo.",
        "I didn’t know that.",
        "See, maybe that’s the one we should’ve actually hidden.",
        "This isn’t one of those uh, y’know \"If she doesn’t come, we-we don’t, we don’t come?\" Right? Because I already bought my ticket…",
        "Oh, that's Ross's.",
        "Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?",
        "[stuttering incoherently] F-hah.... flennin....",
        "I KNEW IT!!!!",
        "Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?",
        "All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there’s a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! (Reading from the book.) \"It’s almost as good as being there.\"",
        "Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.",
        "If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.",
        "Six-hour trip to London. That’s a lot of Monica.",
        "You got your passport?",
        "There it is.",
        "(entering, with Joey) All right! Let’s do it!",
        "Okay, ‘cause that’s not gonna get annoying.",
        "Hey, y’know what? I was wrong.",
        "Hey! (Trots over)",
        "Oh. (Goes and gets Phoebe’s book as Rachel comes in from her room.)",
        "(entering, with Phoebe’s book.) Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.",
        "I am, I’m ignoring you.",
        "Oh, what the hell is that?",
        "Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!",
        "Okay. Listen-listen, we’re not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?",
        "I think it’s great. It’s great. Y’know, they’re thinking of changing the name of this place.",
        "To Put the Camera Away!!!",
        "Well, I don’t have to buy that, \"I’m with stupid\" T-shirt anymore.",
        "All right, look, you’re not really gonna buy that are you? Don’t you think you’ve embarrassed me enough for one day?",
        "How can I answer that when I’m pretending I don’t know you?",
        "Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?",
        "All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y’know, you’re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.",

        "And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did and pee-ed all over the crossword.",
        "Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, but I've got to go. I've got Lamaze class.",
        "No, Susan's gonna be there too. We've got dads, we've got lesbians, the whole parenting team.",
        "No, no. I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I'm pretty comfortable with the whole situation.",
        "I know.",
        "I'm Ross Geller, and that's, that's my boy in there, and uh, this is Carol Willick, and this is Susan Bunch. Susan is Carol's... Who's next?",

        "Although I was married to her.",
        "Right.",

        "You ok?",
        "You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?",
        "Sorry. Hi. Sorry I'm late. Where's Carol?",
        "No, no, no. I think I should stay. I think we should both know what's going on.",
        "What? What?",
        "Ok, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time.",
        "I see. So what do you propose to do?",
        "Flip me for it? No, no, no--heads, heads!",
        "Susan, go deep.",
        "Carol, honey, shhh, everything's gonna be all right.",
        "I'm gonna be a father.",
        "I always knew I was havin' a baby, I just never realized the baby was having me.",
        "Aw, how can you say that? I can't even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?",
        "Come on, he doesn't know this stuff. If he knew how you felt--",
        "I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.",
        "I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!",
        "Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.",
        "Okay, okay, what's going on?",
        "Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?",
        "What? What? What?!",
        "That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?",
        "That's, that's nice twice!",
        "What was with the dishes?",
        "...desperate, needy, pathetic?",
        "You- you had what?",
        "What, uh... what were you thinking?",

        "No, no, with him. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby. I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defense is comin' right at me.",
        "Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, I just heave it downfield.",
        "Anyway, suddenly I'm downfield, and I realize that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See, I am so not ready to be a father.",
        "Whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?",
        "Tonight.",
        "You take your time.",

        "Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?",
        "Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of panicky, \"Oh my god I'm gonna be a father\" kind of a thing?",
        "No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.",
        "Thanks, Dad. Really, you know, I just, I just needed to know, when did you start to feel like a father?",
        "No, we can go to Williamsburg.",
        "Good. Maybe he can switch it back. Maybe not.",
        "Hey.",
        "Well did you try calling her?",
        "Do you have a point?",

        "Yours. I just got 43 points for \"kidney\".",
        "I had a \"k\". Where's my \"k\"?",
        "You've got to help me! My monkey swallowed a \"k\"!",
        "No, you don't understand. The animal hospital is way across town. He's choking. I don't know what else to do.",
        "Lady, he is people. He has a name, ok? He watches Jeopardy. He touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please, have a heart!",
        "He looks so tiny.",
        "Yeah. The doctor got the \"k\" out. He also found an \"m\" and an \"o\".",
        "Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine. He's just sleeping now.",

        "Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that. You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know?

        "This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.",
        "Hi, honey.",
        "Hello to the rest.",

        "It's breast milk.",

        "I did not freak out.",
        "Because it's breast milk. It's gross.",
        "No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just don't think breast milk is for adults.",
        "That would be no.",
        "You've tasted it? You've tasted it.",
        "Oh, you've tasted it.",
        "Gimme the bottle. Gimme the towel.",
        "I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.",

        "Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?",
        "Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.",
        "You uh, you don't believe in gravity?",
        "How can you not believe in evolution?",
        "Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.",
        "You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.",
        "Well, there you go.",
        "Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?",
        "Please tell me you're joking.",
        "No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--",
        "Is there blood coming out of my ears?",
        "You remember Janice, right?",
        "Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.",
        "It's the only possibility, Phoebe.",
        "There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.",
        "What?",
        "You comin'?",
        "Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!",

        "Ok.",
        "Oh, you and me?",
        "Ok.",
        "As in, \"I now pronounce you wife and wife\" married?",
        "Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.",
        "No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!",
        "Mmm hmmm.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.",
        "Would it matter?",
        "I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?",
        "If you wanna call that a reason.",
        "Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.",

        "Oh my god.",
        "It's ok. I'm sorry.",
        "I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.",
        "Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.",
        "Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.",
        "Any time. [He doesn't want to let her go]",
        "Yeah, can't help but.",

        "C'mon, what's his name?",
        "Come on, tell me.",
        "Oh, I promise, what.",
        "Who's Richard Burke? Doc, Doctor Burke? You have a date with Doctor Burke? Why, why, why should that bother me? I, I love that man, he's like a uh, brother to dad.",
        "Doctor Burke is sexy?",

        "I'm sorry, my pie was, was in your hood. Now I just have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants and I'll be back in the hospital by 7. [swats at an imaginary insect by his head, guy leaves promptly]",
        "Calm down, I'm blow drying.",
        "[comes out] All yours.",
        "[in a childish voice] I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.",
        "[childish voice] Shut up.",
        "[childish voice] Mi-mi-mii.",
        "I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.",
        "Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated.",
        "No. You're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now, OK, you're not... rommmates anymore.",
        "No, there is no way he was a velociraptor. No Tony, look at the cranial ridge, OK. If Dino was a velociraptor, he would have eaten the Flintstones. Yeah, yeah. [Monica comes out of her room] Oh, were you takin' a nap?",
        "Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line. [gets the other line] Hello. Oh yeah she's here but uh, can she call you back? OK thanks. [hangs up the other line] Call Joanna. [back on with Tony] Hi.",
        "Did you see me write one down?",
        "Well, she'll call back, don't be such a baby.",
        "Look, you wanna get off my back?",
        "Wait hold on Tony, hold on. [answers second line] Hello. Hi, yeah no, she's right here. Um hold on. [gets first line] Hi Tony, can I call you back? That's uh, that's my sister's boyfriend.",
        "OK.",
        "Uh, Eddie something. He just met him.",
        "I know.",
        "Tough noogies, we're watching Predators of the Serengetti.",
        "Wha-, oh, quit it.",
        "Well, Monica keeps changin' the channel.",
        "Well, I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight.",
        "Ow, ow, OK. Alright, alright, Mon, Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, alright.",
        "Why, why, why can't you stand me being here? I don't, I, we're just, ya know, we're just havin' fun.",
        "Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids.",
        "You hated me when we were kids?",
        "Why did you hate me?",
        "And that wasn't fun for you?",
        "I can't believe you hated me.",
        "Really?",
        "I can do that.",
        "So you wanna watch uh, Entertainment Tonight?",
        "What?",
        "Ohh... OK. [changes the channel]",
        "What woman?",
        "Hey you guys.",
        "Uh, sweetie we've gotta go.",
        "No?",
        "Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.",
        "Excuse me, your, your, your wind?",
        "You, you know I, I don't, have a- have a problem with that.",
        "I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it.",
        "What, what's that?",
        "Open it, open in.",
        "Woah.",
        "Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due.",
        "What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?",
        "Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World.",
        "That audition.",
        "Joey, you owe $1100 at I Love Lucite.",
        "So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money.",
        "Toilet paper?",
        "Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic.",
        "I am your friend.",
        "But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.",
        "Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another.",
        "Huh, I'm just saying...",
        "Ya know, maybe, maybe I should just go.",
        "Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok.",
        "[enters] Oh my God, what's goin' on?",
        "No look I wasn''t right, that's what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey.",
        "Yeah. And you should hold out for something bigger. I can't tell you how much respect I have for you not going to that stupid cab driver audition.",
        "Great, how did it go?",
        "Good for you.",
        "You're livin' the dream.",
        "All right then.",
        "What?",
        "[approaching the mover holding the parrot] Hey hold on, hold on. How much for the uh, how much to save the bird?",
        "Dollars? You spent $1200 dollars on a plastic bird?",
        "Go ahead, go ahead with the bird. Ok, do you have anything for around 200?",
        "Huh.",
        "I'll take it. My gift to you man.",
        "I'm sorry I'm late, what happened?",
        "Well, we should probably get going.",
        "My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.",
        "G'night.",
        "Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?",
        "C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them.",
        "Better not be doin' these in order.",
        "Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.",
        "Really?",
        "Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.",
        "Animal s*x, animal s*x? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk s*x?",
        "Knock-knock.",
        "Until now. [jumps on Rachel on the bed]",
        "[comes out of the bedroom] Rachel. [growls then sees Richard standing there] Hey.",
        "Good, good, good. So, is uh, was your moustache, did, used to be different?",
        "Oh. How do you uh, ya know, keep it so neat?",
        "Oh. And what do you call that?",
        "So were you in Nam?",
        "No, no way. You've got it totally the other way around my friend. John Voit was...",
        "What, what oh....[Ross and Rachel go into her room]",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "No. [sound of Dr. Remore's body hitting the bottom of the shaft] Now maybe.",
        "C'mon.",
        "Open up. We want to talk to you.",
        "How could you not tell us?",
        "Hey.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh man.",
        "You got it.",
        "What? What's on your shoulder?",
        "A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? [to Rachel] Hi.",
        "No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?",
        "I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'",
        "Alright, shall we?",
        "Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it. [opens door] We're here.",
        "Hi ma.",
        "Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.",
        "Dad, you really don't want to do that.",
        "Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.",
        "Mon, Mon, are you OK?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Eww.",
        "Ohh.",
        "Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?",
        "I'll take that dad. [grabs the bat]",
        "You got a tattoo?",
        "Lemme see. [looks]",
        "Well it's really. . . sexy. I wouldn't have thought it would be but. . . wow.",
        "Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?",
        "Hey, save us some pizza. [they go off to Rachel's room]",
        "Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck.",
        "[enters] Hiii.",
        "Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox.",
        "Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it.",
        "You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.",
        "Ok, dinner's on.",
        "Alright you kids, bye now.",
        "Oh look, a low budget puppet show.",
        "So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?",
        "Wow, it, it's neat learning about submarines.",
        "Bye Ryan.",
        "You like that do ya?",
        "I'll make some calls. [Runs off.]",
        "Is this what you had in mind?",
        "I'm shipping out tomorrow.",
        "Alright you know, why don't I just meet you upstairs. [Drops her on the couch and walks out holding his lower back.]",
        "Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.",
        "On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.",
        "Freakish.",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "Yeah alright.",
        "Oh, sorry we didn't know.",
        "Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee.",
        "Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat.",
        "Because it's a special hat. [Chandler looks at Ross funny] See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler...",
        "It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know. We're grown ups, this kinda stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore.",
        "Hi.",
        "What?",
        "Do you say this stuff to girls?",
        "You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.",
        "Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat.",
        "Thank you Gunther. We didn't want to have to go and do that.",
        "Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice. [flicks the ends of the big bully's tie]",
        "I know.",
        "Let's, let's take this outside? Who talks like that?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight you guys.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "How come it's not mixing with the water?",
        "No.",
        "No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.",
        "Yeah, sure.",
        "No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.",
        "Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take?",
        "I think we proved our point.",
        "Cannot feel my tounge.",
        "Yes, and that's why we're here.",
        "Woah, ho-ho, whad'ya got there, a weapon?",
        "Whad'ya mean?",
        "Before I forget, are we hitting faces?",
        "Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation.",
        "Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I'm standin here, huh.",
        "Hey.",
        "God, that was, that was amazing, that was incredible. You guys, you guys kicked butt.",
        "Yeah he was wasn't he.",
        "So, listen guys, are we uh, are we ok here?",
        "Alright.",
        "Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?",
        "Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.",
        "Hi honey, how did it go?",
        "Thanks for being born.",
        "Oh, now you can exchange them if you want, ok.",
        "Really?",
        "All right.",
        "What?",
        "You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares.",
        "That's who.",
        "Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?",
        "Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery....game?",
        "I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.",
        "Oh, here, I, I'll get it for ya. Whad'ya want?",
        "Scotch. Alright, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass.",
        "Cool.",
        "I know.",
        "Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom. Stay clear of the salmon mousse.",
        "Oh, mine too. Isn't that neat, scotch neat. Would you excuse me? [walks out in the hallway, Mr. Greene is walking out of Chandler and Joey's apartment] Hey, hey, where you uh, sneakin off to mister?",
        "No. no.",
        "No, um, see 'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir.",
        "All righty roo. [closes the door] What a great moment to say that for the first time. [goes to get the cigarettes and glasses]",
        "Mine.",
        "Um-hmm. [puts them on] I have a condition, apparently, that I require two different sets of focals.",
        "Neil Sedaka wears them.",
        "Ohh, big smoker. [Packs the cigarettes and flings one on Mrs. Greene in the process. Finally gets one in his mouth and it look really out of place] Big big smoker. In fact I'm gonna go ou into the hallway and fire up this bad boy. [as he walks into the hall, he comes face to face with Mr. Greene]",
        "Yes. [pulls them off and hands them to Mr. Greene] I was just warming up the earpieces for you.",
        "[pulls the cigarette off his upper lip and hands it to Mr. Greene] Yeah, yes it is, I was just moistening the tip.",
        "I'm getting ready for the water skiing. [Mr. Greene opens the door which pulls Ross in] How are you doing?",
        "I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.",
        "Hey Mon!",
        "Nope.",
        "Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.",
        "Getting it away from me would be job one.",
        "You need to get some sleep.",
        "Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.",
        "Hmm?",
        "Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.",
        "I think I have an old band uniform from high school.",
        "Yeah.",
        "What?",
        "No.",
        "Nope.",
        "What?",
        "Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?",
        "Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia.",
        "Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty cool.",
        "(entering with Monica in tow) Hey!",
        "Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter.",
        "Okay.",
        "Hi.",
        "Guess what?",
        "They published my paper.",
        "How could you have told her?",
        "Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.",
        "Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.",
        "That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.",
        "Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.",
        "Noo!",
        "Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?",
        "Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?",
        "I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think.",
        "Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?",
        "No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth....",
        "Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?",
        "Nooo!",
        "Yeah?",
        "Okay, okay, I'll go first.",
        "So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing....",
        "Yes!",
        "Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.",
        "Okay.",
        "Hmph.",
        "With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!",
        "Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?",
        "I said 'share' not 'scare'. Go sit over there! (Chandler goes over and sits at a table and puts his head down).",
        "No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's (turns and sees his Mom standing where Rachel is)",
        "I hate Chandler, the b*st*rd ruined my life. (Rachel starts looking around and down, with a 'What the hell is going on?' look on her face.)",
        "What're you talkin' about?",
        "Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end?",
        "[smells Ben's butt] No no, you're fine, you're fine.",
        "Hi.",
        "Oh you guys are not gonna believe what happened.",
        "Ok, we were sitting over there playing on the floor and he grabs the table and he pulls himself up. He pulled himself up. Standing man. I'm sorry you guys missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it.",
        "I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?",
        "Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want him for more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen , I mean, I feel like-",
        "Really? I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared.",
        "Oh look, did, did you just see that? Did you see? He just waved, he just waved, he's never waved before, you've never waved before. Yes he has. Very good.",
        "Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg.",
        "Buy mommy.",
        "Have a good time. Ok, Ben.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.",
        "Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.",
        "Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.",
        "Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off.",
        "What're you doing?",
        "Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb.",
        "Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.",
        "Ok, here, here. There we go.",
        "It's alright, it's no big deal.",
        "Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby.",
        "What?",
        "Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.",
        "Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.",
        "Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.",
        "Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.",
        "Huh?",
        "[enters] Ok, what the hell happened back there?",
        "Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.",
        "C'mon, what, you never think about our future?",
        "No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.",
        "The big book of childrens' names.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Ok fine.",
        "We're not done.",
        "Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.",
        "Good, 'cause I love you.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well that's the first time we've said that.",
        "Well, I'm gonna kiss you.",
        "Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail.",
        "[doorbell buzzes] Hello.",
        "Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together. [walks in his room]",
        "Wha, what?",
        "What, the word hi?",
        "Great, great, and I miss that too, I miss everything.",
        "Something about hi.",
        "Well, this was fun. Uh, we should really do it again sometime, wha'dya say? Ok. Alright so I've got him.",
        "Tuesday right. Ok, bye you guys.",
        "Bye Ben.",
        "Alright, alright, ok. Bye.",
        "Bye.",
        "Bye.",
        "Bye.",
        "Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. (Rachel looks at him in disbelief) Or you just do it.",
        "Over my dead body! (Joey looks at Chandler)",
        "(entering from Rachel's bedroom) Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good! (turns around, and under his breath, to the rest of the guys) Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good.",
        "So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.",
        "What's she look like?",
        "Get out!",
        "Get away from me I said no!",
        "Hey, there. ",
        "Are you all right?",
        "Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride.",
        "Okay, good luck (kisses her and leaves)",
        "I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'",
        "Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad.",
        "(standing up) Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that...",
        "Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.",
        "Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis. (da-doom-chesh) (to drummer) What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me (looks for the da-doom-chesh, and doesn't get one) Cheers.",
        "(runs after her) No, Rach!",
        "Marenge,",
        "Everybody!",
        "(seeing her also) Yeah, 'cause life's just that kind.",
        "All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes (kisses Joey).",
        "Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and s*x with celebrities.",
        "Spiderman?",
        "Thank you.",
        "Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First, I’ll divide my perspective canidates into catergories....",
        "Hey.",
        "Okay, I’ve got three of my five.",
        "Celebrities I’m allowed to sleep with.",
        "Yeah, it’s hard okay, I only have two spots left.",
        "Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....",
        "Susan Sarandon.",
        "And!! Isabella Rosselini.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Okay, I’m done with my choices, these are final. (holds up a little card)",
        "Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer.",
        "That would be me.",
        "Hey, it’s my list.",
        "Okay!! Okay!!",
        "Heavy thing, not getting lighter!",
        "(to Gunther) Thank you.",
        "Isabella Rosselini. (points to her)",
        "Damn! I can’t believe I took her off my list.",
        "Yeah, maybe.",
        "What you don’t think I’d go up to her?",
        "Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.",
        "Okay, hold my crawler.",
        "(to Isabella) Hi! Hi, I’m Ross, you don’t know me, but I’m a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? (Gunther hands her change) Or maybe reimburse you for that one?",
        "Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that’s okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, (gets his out) so I’m allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it’s flattery.",
        "Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don’t, don’t just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...",
        "Um, yeah.",
        "Um, no.",
        "But, okay.",
        "Um, see, but that’s not the final draft.",
        "Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler (Chandler waves) brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.",
        "What?",
        "(to the rest of the gang) We’re just gonna be friends.",
        "So I told Carl, ‘Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.’ But of course this went in one ear and out.....",
        "Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie.",
        "We?",
        "Oh shoot, tomorrow’s not so good, I’m supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.",
        "Please, he refers to me as ‘wethead’.",
        "Fine.",
        "Hi Gunther.",
        "What?",
        "Come on! That’s great.",
        "Y’know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.",
        "Nice to see you again Dr. Green.",
        "Ugh, museum.",
        "There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one.",
        "Yeah, if you’re really hungry. (Dr. Green stares at him) It was a joke, I made a joke.",
        "It’s not a library...",
        "So, Dr. Green, how’s the old boat.",
        "It gives it a nice antiquey look.",
        "Wow. I’m sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that. (Rachel giggles at that)",
        "Okay! (picks up a knife and pretends to stab his heart.)",
        "Yeah. (sees the bill) Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must’ve added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.",
        "That’s Daddy?! But doesn’t it bother you? You’re a waitress.",
        "So?",
        "You really serve people sneezers?",
        "Thanks again, Dr. Green.",
        "Oh, ah, you don’t need that.",
        "The carbon, it’s messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.",
        "Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it’s a sickness really.",
        "I know.",
        "Nothing I do means anything, really.",
        "Well Mr. Big Shot is better than ‘wethead’.",
        "Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there’s a bug in my food.",
        "Yeah, I’m gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.",
        "Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?",
        "Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn’t work.",
        "Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn’t make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say ‘Like me! Like me tiny doctor!’",
        "Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we’re never gonna get along.",
        "Okay, okay, okay. (hugs her) I’ll get the bagels.",
        "Dr. Green. How are you? (offers his hand, and Dr. Green puts his scarf on it.)",
        "Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.",
        "(to Rachel) Okay, that’s it, I can’t take it anymore.",
        "Oh, please. Sweetie it’s hopeless, okay, I’m just gonna go. (starts to leave rubbing his neck)",
        "Look, look I’m sorry. It’s just that....",
        "Thank you! That’s what I keep saying.",
        "Uh.",
        "And his first name.",
        "Oh-ho please. Ask her how?",
        "Argue with that.",
        "I know that!",
        "What can I do, she doesn’t listen to me about renter’s insurance either.",
        "Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?",
        "Okay. (to Rachel) Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?",
        "Excellent!",
        "(to Chandler) Are you intrigued?",
        "There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi (Ben is\n      holding a Barbi doll) What's ah, what's my boy doing with a\n      Barbi?",
        "Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it,\n      again?",
        "You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so\n      am I.",
        "Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how\n      'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? (makes a\n      monster truck sound) No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder?\n      (squawks like a dinosaur)",
        "And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?",
        "You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very\n      important to you.",
        "(to Joey) Where there is no fear of commitment.",
        "Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben.\n      (singing) 'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi,\n      drop the Barbi.",
        "Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!",
        "Go Joe!!!",
        "(running into the hall, in slow motion) You'll never get me,\n      Joe!!! (he then pretends that he gets shot repeatedly and falls\n      back against Joey and Chandler's door, dead.)",
        "Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he\n      chose.",
        "Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't deal\n      with it, that's your 'too bad.'",
        "What?",
        "What are you talking about?",
        "Okay, you are totally making this up.",
        "(remembering) Oh God.",
        "There was no song. (to Monica) There was no song!",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay, that's, that's enough. (retreats to the bathroom)",
        "(coming out of the bathroom) Won't you dance around with me. ",
        "(singing) 'I am Bea. I drink tea. Won't you dance around\n            with....' (spills some tea and it drips onto his/her\n            dress) Ohhh! (runs away crying)",
        "I’m sorry the answer there would be...none of us.",
        "Yeah, I’ll take some.",
        "What?",
        "Hey, y'know while we’re on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don’t live here anymore.",
        "Phoebe, she doesn’t know that you sneak out every night, she doesn’t know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn’t know that you’ve been living with your Grandmother’s for a week now.",
        "Hey.",
        "So how many more do you have tomorrow?",
        "(to Phoebe) Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.",
        "I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...",
        "Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.",
        "Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn’t really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it’s gonna make a difference",
        "No real-, honey, really it’s fine, just g-go with Susan. Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay, okay, bye",
        "I don’t know, something girlie.",
        "(all depressed) Hi. Where is everybody?",
        "My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.",
        "‘Cause Carol’s a lesbian. (Phoebe is shocked) And, and I’m not one. And apparently it’s not a mix and match situation.",
        "(sets out a bunch of shot glasses and starts to poor himself a drink, many drinks) I’m an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I’d be out and she’d, she’d see some beautiful woman, and, and she’d be Ross y'know look at her, and I’d think, God, my wife is cool!",
        "Well, now I do!!",
        "Seven years. I mean we’ve been together seven years, she’s the only woman who’s ever loved me, and the only woman I’ve-I’ve ever....",
        "Maybe this would’ve happened if I’d been more nurturing, or I’d paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can’t believe this!",
        "Thanks.",
        "Thanks. (kisses her on the lips)",
        "Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.",
        "Wait, wait, wait.",
        "My foot is stuck in the pocket.",
        "No, I can’t get it out.",
        "No, come on don’t start. (they start kissing again) Ouch!",
        "Stupid balls are in the way. (holds up two balls)",
        "Oh well. It probably would’ve been the most constructive solution.",
        "Huh? (the rest of the gang enters)",
        "My wife’s a lesbian.",
        "Hi.",
        "Neither will I. (they both put back the brownies.)",
        "So what’s a matter, you need a dentist? I’ve got a good one.",
        "Why? Why can’t you go to him?",
        "Pheebs, come on, you didn’t kill anybody, these people just\n      happened to die when you went to the dentist. It’s, it’s, it’s\n      just ah, a coincidence.",
        "Thanks, Gunther. (takes the plate Gunther serves him and\n      Rachel comes up and kisses him) (to Rachel) Hey! (to Gunther)\n      Umm, can I get a napkin too?",
        "(patting his clothes like he is looking for his wallet) No, no he’s\n      not.",
        "What? (to Joey) So what are you going to do? I mean how,\n      how are you going to tell Chandler?",
        "Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few\n      hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.",
        "Well, they painted over the word ‘Sapien’ for one thing, then\n      they rearranged the figures, let’s just leave it at that.",
        "Yes, that’s what I was going to ask, thank you.",
        "You? You! Want to watch Ben? (in the background Monica\n      mouths ‘Don’t worry, I’ll be here the whole time.’ to Ross.) Yes!\n      That’d be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know\n      how empty her life is. (Monica sarcastically mouths ‘Yeah!’ and\n      holds up her thumb.)",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hmm?",
        "Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.",
        "(entering) Hey! Everyone.",
        "How’s my little boy?",
        "(noticing the outfit he is wearing) What’d you do, take him\n      whaling?",
        "Oh my God, he just said your name, that’s great! Good job\n      Ben.",
        "And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time\n      isn’t moving.",
        "Well, he’s finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?",
        "It’s okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the\n      time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you\n      did the best you could.",
        "I know! I’m saying you have to watch them all the time.",
        "Monica did it?",
        "Monica?",
        "Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?",
        "Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing\n      the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but\n      suddenly he’s leaving out ‘e’ and ‘f.’ It’s like they just ah,\n      I don’t know, fell out of his head.",
        "Oh, and also, he’s, he’s walkin’ kind of funny, his left leg is\n      moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he’s in there just\n      sort of y'know... (walks around in a circle) ",
        "Monica bang! Monica bang! (runs into one of the posts) Ow!",
        "Can we please focus here, a naked man’s life hangs in the\n      balance!",
        "He does not look happy.",
        "Real magic does exist.",
        "Ah, somebody’s at the door on the ceiling.",
        "Hey Chandler, there’s a party tomorrow, you’ll feel better then.",
        "Oh, somebody’s feeling better.",
        "Hi!",
        "Wow!",
        "What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?",
        "And he’s, he’s a total stranger?",
        "Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some s*x.",
        "Well, I’m just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.",
        "Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?",
        "Thank you. (to Rachel) So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Hi.",
        "Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.",
        "Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.",
        "That’s excellent.",
        "(to Rachel) So, he’s just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn’t want anything in exchange for helping him?",
        "Yeah.",
        "(to Rachel) You see what men do! Don’t tell me men are not nice! (points to Chandler) This is men!!",
        "Which one is Gina?",
        "That’s okay.",
        "Hey, Joey.",
        "Ah, which, which one?",
        "Mary-Angela.",
        "Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How’s it going. This is the hardest letter I’ve ever had to write. (to Chandler) What the hell’s a matter with you? How do you think Joey’s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?",
        "All right, look, look, you’ve got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.",
        "Where in Cuba?",
        "Bummer.",
        "No, I’m genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn’t work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.",
        "But, you, you don’t want to seem too pushy.",
        "(to Rachel, as she gets his number) What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home?",
        "That’s right good things, that-that is what I said. (glances at Monica)",
        "That is so made up!",
        "There you go.",
        "Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I’d expect nothing less.",
        "High collar and baggy pants say I’m a pro.",
        "You go get ‘em. (to Monica) What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way?",
        "‘Why don’t you call him?!’ Well, thank you very much! Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!",
        "Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.",
        "No.",
        "Well, yeah!",
        "(shyly) You grow up.",
        "Hi!",
        "Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I... (gives her a flower)",
        "Hi. (kisses her)",
        "How’d did it go?",
        "I’m so proud of you.",
        "Listen, I’m ah, I’m sorry I’ve been so crazy and jealous and, it’s just that I like you a lot, so...",
        "Yeah.",
        "Congratu!! (sees her hug Mark) -lations-lations.",
        "Maybe he’s just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?",
        "Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?",
        "Ah, we’ll all go. (motions to Chandler) Come on. (the guys leave)",
        "Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.",
        "Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.",
        "All right here. Watch me execute the three ‘P’s of championship play. Power. (swings the racquet) Precision. (swings the racquet.) and penache. (does a backswing and hits Sarah who’s started up the stairs, knocking her down, they both watch in horror.)",
        "I know. I feel horrible. Okay.",
        "Well, I’m gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she’ll like?",
        "All right, see you guys. (starts to leave)",
        "So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don’t have to sell those cookies anymore.",
        "Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?",
        "I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.",
        "Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. (starts to get out his wallet) How much are the boxes?",
        "(puts away his wallet) And what is second prize?",
        "Well, that makes sense.",
        "Yeah, Sarah, anything.",
        "Hi, I’m selling Brown Bird cookies.",
        "No, hi, I’m, I’m an honorary Brown Bird (does the Brown Bird salute.)",
        "Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I’m not invited to sleep-overs.",
        "No, please, please, um, it’s for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.",
        "Okay, okay! I’m going. I’m going. (goes across the hall to knock on another door.)",
        "All right!!",
        "...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.",
        "Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I’m trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I’m putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?",
        "No, but ah, there’s coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I’ll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.",
        "Mon?",
        "Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, y'know I’m sure that’s not gonna happen this time, why don’t I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph’s.",
        "Oh, come on, now you know you want ‘em.",
        "I’ll tell you what Mon, I’ll give you the first box for free.",
        "Come on! All the cool kids are eating ‘em! (chases after her.)",
        "....and 12, 22, 18, four... (Chandler starts laughing) What?",
        "Ah, we’re out. I sold them all.",
        "Monica, I’m cutting you off.",
        "Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.",
        "Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!",
        "Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as ‘Laser Floyd’ was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That’s when it occurred to me, the key to my success, ‘the munchies.’ So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me: 'Cookie Dude!'",
        "Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?",
        "Well you sure used a large font.",
        "Sweetie, calm down, it’s gonna be okay.",
        "What, that wasn’t the great news?",
        "(to the girl sitting next to him) Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell?",
        "Hey now! That was an accident, okay.",
        "What’s a scrud?",
        "I don’t have too. I can just look at you.",
        "(to himself) Not nice enough.",
        "(to himself) Good for a scrud.",
        "That’s crap!! Sister Brown Bird. (to Elizabeth) Good going. (does the salute)",
        "Hi there!",
        "Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency.",
        "Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.",
        "Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you’re gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. (she glares at him) That’s not how that was supposed to come out.",
        "That word was swans.",
        "No.",
        "I’m, I’m sorry you didn’t get to go to Spacecamp, and I’m hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah Tuttle’s Private Very Special Spacecamp!! (opens the door and Chandler and Joey jump up, their apartment is decorated like outer space, one of the leather chairs is covered in tinfoil.)",
        "Oh come on! Here we go! (picks her up and puts her in the chair) Stand by for mission countdown!",
        "Oh no! An asteroid! (throws the soccer ball off the back of Joey’s head.)",
        "(to Chandler) It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!",
        "Why?",
        "Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.",
        "Hmm? Oh, yeah. (he makes a growling sound)",
        "Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?",
        "Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?",
        "What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?",
        "She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, (to Joey) he's really good looking. (Joey gives an enthusiastic thumbs up) What am I gonna do?",
        "Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities.",
        "Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em.",
        "(on phone) Hi, is Rachel there?",
        "This is Ross?",
        "Of Ross and Rachel.",
        "Oh hey, hey Mark.",
        "Okay.",
        "Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone?",
        "Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in his own office?",
        "Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she?",
        "What?",
        "Okay, bye-bye. (starts slamming the receiver down in anger.)",
        "Oh, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry sweetie, I was just trying to ah, I'm dialing another number. (hangs up)",
        "It's from Ross, it's a love bug.",
        "I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt!",
        "I mean my God...",
        "...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!!",
        "I would never do that!",
        "Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot.",
        "Why?! How?! How is he a genius?",
        "What am I going to do?",
        "I don't know you guys.",
        "All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!",
        "What's going on?! (throws the love bug at him) That's what's going on!!",
        "I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! What do I have to do to get some service?! (turns to Rachel) Hi Rach. (He's puts his hand on her shoulder and she knocks it away.)",
        "(entering) Hi.",
        "(sits down next to her) I'm sorry, I was an idiot.",
        "A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.",
        "Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.",
        "I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.",
        "Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.",
        "Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?",
        "Ahh, no.",
        "Are you jealous?",
        "You are totally jealous.",
        "Honey, I love you too.",
        "What?",
        "Huh.",
        "Halftime.",
        "What?",
        "Um, Monica and I aren’t supposed to play football.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.",
        "Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn’t count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.",
        "Oh yeah! Then how come you didn’t get the Geller Cup?",
        "Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, ‘nobody won that game, ‘ and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... (pauses to collect himself, as he is on the verge of tears saying this) threw it in the lake.",
        "Anyway. That’s when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.",
        "Can I see you for a second?",
        "All right, we’re gonna play.",
        "Here you go. (throws her the ball)",
        "(holding both of their hands above their heads making rabbit ears with their fingers.) Bunny!",
        "Sweetie, don’t worry you’ll get picked. Chandler.",
        "Sweetie, now I pick you.",
        "Okay. All right. So let’s see, let’s play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we’ll kick off.",
        "Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!",
        "Come on, let’s go!",
        "Yeah, losers talk!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Okay, (to Chandler) this play, I want you to do a down and out to the right. Okay. Break!",
        "You, you go long.",
        "Until we start to look very small.",
        "Break!!",
        "One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!",
        "Uh, hello, it’s third down.",
        "Wow!",
        "It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.",
        "Okay, it’s second down. (turns away) Take all the second downs you need.",
        "Well, I said it loud.",
        "Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie..",
        "Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Okay. Hut! Hike!",
        "Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn’t count.",
        "Before the snap!",
        "Oh Pheebs, that’s great. It doesn’t count.",
        "Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.",
        "Oh-ho, okay.",
        "Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.",
        "Okay, first of all, I don’t play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!",
        "Oh really! Why is that?",
        "The Geller Cup.",
        "Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!",
        "That cup is mine!",
        "Chandler! Chandler!",
        "Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What’s with the tackling?",
        "Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough.",
        "Hey, where’d you get that?",
        "It’s no surprise that your winning, ‘cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.",
        "What?! The guys against the girls? See, that’s ridiculous Monica, because I’m only down by three touchdowns.",
        "Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you’re with me.",
        "Right. Okay, let’s play. Let’s go.",
        "Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let’s play some ball, guys.",
        "Okay, y'know what, let’s just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?",
        "Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...",
        "Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.",
        "Hey! It’s 42-21!",
        "Let go! Let go!",
        "No! You let go!",
        "How come it’s always us left in the field holding the ball?",
        "Hey! It’s starting to snow.",
        "Gimme the this!",
        "What are you doing?",
        "No thanks. I’m 29.",
        "Oh sweetie, when do you think you’re going to get off tonight?",
        "Oh come on, not again.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.",
        "And what are you going to do for him?",
        "Okay.",
        "So, are you gonna see him again?",
        "Naked friends.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh.",
        "Yeah, make that three.",
        "Okay. (goes over to the counter) (to Chandler) What ah, what is the matter with you? What’s going on?",
        "What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay?",
        "What?!",
        "Are you sure? (Chandler nods: Yes!) Hold on. (walks over behind the couch) I’m sorry you guys, that was a coffee and a....",
        "Okay.",
        "No, no, that won’t be ah, that won’t be necessary (leans down and looks up Robert’s shorts, seeing Robert’s package.)",
        "Yeah, yeah, yeah!",
        "Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.",
        "Umm, Jo’s a girl, it’s short for Josephine.",
        "Hey! How’d the ah, basketball go?",
        "Calm down. There’s no reason to get testy.",
        "Good.",
        "Joey’s asking if you’ve just ruined the first book he’s ever loved that didn’t star Jack Nicholson?",
        "Oh.",
        "He’s right, even if it’s to say something complementary. (He stops and thinks about what he just said.)",
        "(to Chandler) Hey, don’t we have to...",
        "I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.",
        "Is this about Mark?",
        "Okay, it’s not, it’s not.",
        "Fine, you’re right. Let’s ah, let’s take a break, (goes to the door) let’s cool off, okay, let’s get some frozen yoghurt, or something.. (opens the door)",
        "(on the phone) I’ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don’t, don’t you think we can work on this?",
        "Who’s that?",
        "Is that Mark?",
        "Yeah! Got it! (slams down the phone)",
        "Yeah!!",
        "Na-huh.",
        "I love you.",
        "Okay. (Ross starts frantically looking for a clock.)",
        "Chloe, Chloe how’s it coming?!!",
        "Umm, oh, hey, I don’t know. How about a big one?",
        "Well then a small one!! Listen, let’s, we kinda have to get going!",
        "You, you sure you need shoes? (Chloe nods her head) Okay. (reaches down and picks up a shoe)",
        "Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? (He’s frantically throwing the cushions off of the couch looking for her other shoe) Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yes, yes I am, one of the many things I’m feeling. Well.... (picks up her coat)",
        "Oh, thank you. (She goes to kiss him, but he holds her coat up between their faces to stop her.) Hey, hey. (opens the door, sees Rachel, and hides Chloe behind the door) Rachel!!!!",
        "Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.",
        "Yes, you can, very much.",
        "(seeing the thumbs up) Ahhhh!! (Hugs Rachel tighter.)",
        "You think?! God, I, ah, I’m in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel’s all like, ‘I love you and, and let’s work on this.’ And all I can think about is, ‘What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?’ when I tell her what I did.",
        "What?! Look, we’re trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?",
        "Yeah, but don’t you think....",
        "Yeah, okay. (he plops down into one of the leather chairs, with the footrest extended.)",
        "What trail?",
        "Oh, I-I don’t think there’s any trail.",
        "(entering) Chloe? Hi..",
        "You took my watch?",
        "Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?",
        "Exactly. So you didn’t, didn’t mention anything to Issac right?",
        "You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven’t actually met...",
        "Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.",
        "Yeah, that’s the one. Listen, I don’t want to hurt her.",
        "Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?",
        "Actually, no, we’re not.",
        "No, we’re not.",
        "No, we’re not!!",
        "Right.",
        "Fine. I just need to know that you’re not gonna tell your sister.",
        "(entering out of breath) Jasmine?",
        "We met at Phoebe’s birthday party, I’m, I’m Ross Geller.",
        "Yes, I did.",
        "Very bad.",
        "I’m agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?",
        "Okay, Jasmine, please, please don’t. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?",
        "Thank you, thank you.",
        "(angrily) Who’s your roommate?",
        "Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn’t say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.",
        "(forcing the door open) Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!",
        "Rachel?",
        "No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?",
        "No!!",
        "No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.",
        "What?",
        "She was...",
        "She, she was different.",
        "Nobody likes change.",
        "What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.",
        "I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.",
        "Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!",
        "Look, I didn’t think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.",
        "That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.",
        "Look, I’m not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!",
        "Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn’t happen!",
        "Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.",
        "Don’t you realise none of this would’ve ever happened if I didn’t think at that same moment you weren’t having s*x with Mark?",
        "(pause) Yes I would.",
        "(less sure) Yes.",
        "(covering his ears and screaming) La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it’s, I mean it’s you.",
        "What? Come on Rach, tell me what you’re thinking?",
        "Order a pizza like, ‘I forgive you?’",
        "Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I’m kinda hungry myself.",
        "No anchovies.",
        "That’s okay, I’ll just pick ‘em off.",
        "You can have the last piece, if you want.",
        "What, now you’re not even taking to me? (moves over to the coffee table) Look Rachel, I-I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I’d lost you, I didn’t know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don’t cheat right, I, that’s not me, I’m not Joey!",
        "Y'know what, y'know what, I’m-I’m not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You’re the one that bailed on us. You’re the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!",
        "That’s what?!",
        "Okay, well here we are. Now we’re in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? (sits down next to her) Look, I, (on the verge of tears) I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I’m sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can’t. (We see Monica and Phoebe are almost in tears.) I just can’t see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.",
        "Okay, okay, okay.",
        "What?",
        "(moving over to stand in front of her) Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn’t work past it together...",
        "Look, look, there’s got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, (takes a hold of one of her arms.) I can’t imagine, I can’t imagine my life without you. (Both of them are starting to cry.) Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, (drops to his knees and hugs her around her waist) and, and....",
        "(crying) Yeah, but this can’t be it, I mean.",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "What is ah, Rach in her room?",
        "Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn’t she know it’s our anniversary?",
        "What’s that on the bottom?",
        "Hey, honey.",
        "Hey, what’s going on?",
        "What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?",
        "(entering, carrying a basket) Hi!",
        "Well you said you couldn’t go out so.... (pulls the cover off of the basket)",
        "Yeah, but I got cous-cous!",
        "Okay, you don’t have to stop, I’m invisible, I’m not here. (lights a candle)",
        "Yeah!!",
        "(stopping grinding) Pepper?",
        "Okay sorry, whew.",
        "(putting out the fire with a squeeze bottle of water) Okay, that’s a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.",
        "I’m sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebody’s off the phone, how ‘bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.",
        "Come on Rach, you don’t have what, ten minutes?",
        "What? (to Sophie) Sophie, does she have ten minutes?",
        "Don’t yell at me okay, this is the most I’ve seen you all week.",
        "Yeah, but wait...",
        "Hey.",
        "No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.",
        "For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?",
        "Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.",
        "Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.",
        "No, but it’d be nice if you realised, it’s just a job!",
        "Yes.",
        "No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I’m happy for ya, but I’m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don’t know what to do anymore.",
        "Is this about Mark?",
        "Okay, it’s not, it’s not.",
        "Oh I’m, I’m making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.",
        "Okay, okay, fine, you’re right. Let’s ah, let’s take a break, (goes to the door) let’s cool off, okay, let’s get some frozen yogart, or something.. (opens the door)",
        "Oh, hi Chloe.",
        "Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we’re gonna break-up instead.",
        "What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.",
        "Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don’t I have to wait a while?",
        "Hi! It’s me.",
        "Really? I’ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don’t, don’t you think we can work on this?",
        "Who’s that?",
        "Is that Mark?",
        "Yeah! Got it! (slams the phone down, and walks back to the bar.)",
        "Ah, that’s okay, thanks.",
        "Look, I don’t feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?",
        "(to Chloe) I like this song.",
        "Oh, no, no.",
        "Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, she’s more..(shakes his shoulders, like he’s dancing) y'know, and you’re more (sees the look from Phoebe and stops)",
        "Hi.",
        "Hello.",
        "Yeah, huh.",
        "What?",
        "Come on sweetie! You’ve had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?",
        "(to Rachel) But work comes first! (to Mark) Oh hey, but that’s sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?",
        "Oh well that’s great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh? (picks a pad up off Rachel’s desk and tosses it into his box) Good bye.",
        "Okay.",
        "Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying ‘I’ll see you Saturday.’",
        "Oh, no, no, no, it’s-it’s not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....",
        "Oh, well...",
        "Well, I’m sorry, but ah, look if you’re not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?",
        "Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...",
        "Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?",
        "Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.",
        "Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.",
        "What should I wear, now I’m all nervous.",
        "(to Rachel) I’m really glad we came. (Rachel smiles and rubs his arm) You’re so pretty. I love you.",
        "(entering) So I nodded off a little.",
        "Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.",
        "First of all it’s Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn’t fly.",
        "Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.",
        "No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island. (Makes an unusual sound, then he realises that he still has his jacket on and quickly tries to shake it off, thinking it’s alive and attacking him.)",
        "No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don’t know, I feel like lately, I feel like you’re slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you’ve got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it’s dumb, but I hate that I’m not a part of it.",
        "That’s a little clearer.",
        "Sure, I-I-I... (hugs her and mouths No!!)",
        "Is everything okay?",
        "Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It’s been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.",
        "Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? (in an Irish accent) Two days of darts, it’ll be great!",
        "No, no, no, this weekend guys!",
        "What’s going on?",
        "So, for the whole weekend?",
        "Yeah, that’s okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I’m alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.",
        "What a pity stay?",
        "Pity food? Y'know what that’s okay, all right, I don’t need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home?",
        "Where’s Ben?",
        "Ahh. (notices the table) Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?",
        "Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?",
        "Ah! (realises) Oh.",
        "Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. ‘Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.",
        "Yeah, well.",
        "Oh yeah, I’d love that.",
        "I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job. (he sits down at the table.)",
        "....right? Right? I mean it’s pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don’t, I don’t need them, huh, I’ve got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.",
        "(looking at the page) 717? (to Carol) Where’s 717? (He gets up to return the page, Carol starts to take the last of the food into the kitchen, but Ross grabs the last piece.) Hey, you’ve have more of these for Susan right?",
        "Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?",
        "Oh, now you want a favour?",
        "Well, oh, I’m sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I’m a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?",
        "No, I’m not gonna pick them up.",
        "No, Rachel doesn’t want me to....",
        "Yeah, you’re right.",
        "We were on a break!!! Okay!! (grabs the phone) We were, we were..., (calms down) yeah. Where are you? I’ll find you. (hangs up)",
        "Oh, you-you’re-you’re one to talk.",
        "He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I’m stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I’ve got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.",
        "Excuse me?",
        "(sarcastic) Oh please, can’t I come to your special, magical cabin?",
        "Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.",
        "All right Pheebs, your cab’s ready.",
        "You’re welcome.",
        "We were on a break!",
        "Hey-hey, it’s valid okay? And I’m not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me.",
        "That’s what you said last night.",
        "Okay.",
        "Obviously not to Joey.",
        "(to Rachel) Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.",
        "I can.",
        "Look, you guys, you guys should go. (Joey tries to say something, but Ross cuts him off.) No, I’m, you, you planned this all out, and I don’t want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.",
        "No, no, really, I’ve got to take the car back anyway, I’m spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It’s fine, no guilt I promise.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay.",
        "That would be great.",
        "I know!",
        "(entering) Hi! Sorry I’m late. Were you sleeping?",
        "Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could, ‘cause that’s not where you want to skimp.",
        "Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?",
        "Okay.",
        "So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?",
        "(outside the door) So I’m gonna take off then!",
        "Pffhah.",
        "Nothing, it’s just that hypnosis is beyond crap.",
        "Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.",
        "Here you go.",
        "Sorry. (To remedy that, Ross scoops the cinnamon off of the top with his hand.)",
        "Exactly, it’ll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.",
        "And so now you guys are gonna be married?",
        "Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?",
        "Pheebs, if you don’t tell him, soon he’s gonna be married, and then you’re gonna hate yourself.",
        "All we’re saying is don’t rush into anything.",
        "Yeah, he-he’s right, he’s right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you’re young, you’re-you’re weird, chicks dig that.",
        "No the man’s right, that’s what I had with Rachel.",
        "No, I ah, I slept with someone else.",
        "It didn’t.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "Don’t ask me, I had it and I blew it!",
        "Oh, no! No!",
        "I’m the ring bearer.",
        "Hi!",
        "Hey, how’d the date go with Mr. Millionaire?",
        "Still?!",
        "I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.",
        "(entering) Hello.",
        "So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.",
        "Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.",
        "Then be supportive like a guy.",
        "Hi.",
        "You ah, wanted to see me?",
        "What?!",
        "What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes, I do.",
        "Yeah, I-I really do. (takes a dinosaur mug out of the box) Hey! This-this was a gift?!",
        "It’s still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!",
        "No!! Y'know-y'know don’t do me any favours. In fact, where, where’s the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, (picks up a book) Hey, this book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I’d like that back too. Yes, I do.",
        "I’m just trying to help you, move on.",
        "Petty...",
        "Petty...",
        "Petty...",
        "Small... (Rachel comes back into the living room and catches Ross mocking her.)",
        "Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!",
        "I’m-I’m gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!! (he kisses the shirt)",
        "Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...",
        "Oh-oh, okay, okay! (He quickly takes off his sweater in order to put on the T-shirt. It’s an old ‘Frankie says relax’ T-shirt, that barely fits him. Rachel nods her head in approval of the new look.) If you don’t mind I’m gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. (Starts to leave) You have a pleasant evening. (He exits and leaves the door open.)",
        "You bug me.",
        "I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she’d say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!",
        "Hey, it’s been like three weeks!",
        "Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I’m gonna kill myself, I swear. I can’t, I can’t watch this. (turns away, then quickly turns to look again) Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she’s going in.",
        "She’s going in. Wait! He’s going in! He’s going in!! The door’s closed! I, I can’t see anything but the door closed!!",
        "Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!",
        "I don’t know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I’ll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!",
        "Look, they must be stopped!",
        "I need juice! People need juice!!",
        "People need juice!",
        "Juice, I need...",
        "Yeah, okay.",
        "It’s just I miss her so much.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.",
        "We were all pretty shaken up about it.",
        "Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.",
        "You get the dollhouse.",
        "Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.",
        "Sure, what’s up?",
        "I-I know. Well if something comes up... (walks away)",
        "Uh, Pheebs, while we’re hovering around the subject. I just have to say dinosaurs, they-they don’t go, rrroof!",
        "Hey, what’s this?!",
        "This is the coolest house ever!!",
        "I would!",
        "Hi.",
        "Hi.",
        "It’s a little early to be drinkin’.",
        "Ohhhhh!",
        "Mon?",
        "Oh, fire! There, there’s a fire! Fire!!",
        "Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, we believe it originated here. (He uses a pointer and points to the point of origin.) In the Aroma Room.",
        "No Phoebe, don’t look! You don’t want to see what’s under there!!",
        "Uh, yeah, I ah, I also need two.",
        "Uh, no, it’s-it’s just this person.",
        "Yeah, kinda. It’s this woman from work. I hope that won’t be too weird. Will it, Rach?",
        "All right, I’ll see you tonight.",
        "Hey, hey Rach!",
        "Hi!",
        "Good.",
        "So it’s looks like we’re the first ones here.",
        "Yay!!",
        "Hey. Oh, I’m sorry, this is Cailin.",
        "And! Break!!",
        "Okay. (The girls leave.) (to Tommy) So uh, well, this-this is uh, this is awkward.",
        "Well y'know ‘cause Rachel and I used to go out.",
        "Oh! Well then this is awkward. So what do you uh…",
        "Oh! Yeah.",
        "Okay. (sees two people sitting in their seats.) Uh, huh. Excuse me, I’m sorry, I-I think you may be in our seats.",
        "(looking at ticket) Yep! Yeah, see this says D-13, and uh…",
        "No, I’m good. (He sits down, stunned.)",
        "(drags Chandler over to buffet table) I’m telling you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think he’s baaad news!",
        "Hi! Yeah! Tommy’s in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in front of him, I think he’s gonna snap. (He’s watching very intently)",
        "Go? Why?",
        "But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream.",
        "Uh, oh-ho bye.",
        "One.",
        "Look. Look, I wasn’t going to say anything to you, but... All right, I don’t think you should be seeing Tommy anymore.",
        "No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him.",
        "No, it’s not just ‘cause I’m jealous. (Both Monica and Chandler give him a ‘Come on’ look) I mean I’m not, I’m not, I’m not jealous, okay? It’s… Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.",
        "Okay, fine, fine. You don’t want to believe me? No, that’s fine. (starts to leave)",
        "You don’t want to believe me, I’m Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny… (turns around and almost spills his coffee on Tommy)",
        "Whoa, sorry Tommy.",
        "Umm…",
        "Okay, it’s coffee.",
        "It’s-it’s hot…",
        "(coming out of the kitchen with a cup of coffee, almost running into Tommy) Oh-ho, whoa! Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled this hot coffee on you.",
        "No, but it’s-it’s-it’s hot!",
        "I can’t believe no one believes me!",
        "You do Pheebs?",
        "Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah.",
        "(surprised) Hi!",
        "Awww.",
        "Yeah. (closes the door, and goes over and kisses Rachel.)",
        "I know.",
        "(stopping suddenly and getting up) Okay, I gotta go.",
        "Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.",
        "Well, yeah. I can’t-I can’t stay here all night, and if I go in there she’s-she’s gonna wanna... do stuff.",
        "No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn’t work either, I can’t tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...",
        "Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?",
        "Yeah, yeah. (opens the door) It wasn’t every morning.",
        "Okay.",
        "It’s over.",
        "Well, it was loong. I didn’t even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o’clock shadow on her head. (They both start to laugh, then stop themselves quickly.) Anyway, she didn’t want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.",
        "Ohh! Thank you! I like mail. (He goes to kiss her again, but she turns away.)",
        "Okay. (He leans in to kiss her again, but she leans back preventing him from making contact.) Wow, it’s-it’s 5:30 in the morning. (Rachel laughs) So, I’d better get cracking on this baby.",
        "Okay, I’ll be up in, (looks at the letter) 18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.",
        "Oh. (looks at his watch) Oh-oh. (takes a drink of coffee and resumes reading the letter)",
        "Done!",
        "Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!",
        "I’m sorry.",
        "Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole ‘Does it?’ part just another glance.",
        "(interrupting) No, Rach, no. I don’t, I don’t, I don’t have to think about it, in fact, I’ve decided, I’ve decided that, that it.......does.",
        "Oh, sure! I’m sure.",
        "Hey!",
        "What happened?",
        "It does. It really and truly does.",
        "(finding the part) (looks up in disgust) It so does not!!!",
        "She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her! (Both Joey and Chandler shrug their shoulders as to say ”Well...”) (yelling) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!",
        "Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here, (reading from the letter) “If you accept full responsibility...” (to Chandler and Joey) Full responsibility! “...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do. (yells at Joey) Does it?!!”",
        "(calming down) Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you’re right. Yeah I guess I’ll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.",
        "What the hell happened on that beach?!",
        "(coming back in with Rachel) Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?",
        "What happened? Joey?",
        "Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... (stops suddenly and turns to look at Monica) Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!",
        "I missed you too.",
        "(getting miffed) I suppose.",
        "(getting angry) Umm-hmm.",
        "(yelling from the bedroom) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!",
        "And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!",
        "I didn’t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn’t finish the whole letter!",
        "I fell asleep!",
        "It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! (they go into the living room, trapping Monica, Chandler, and Joey in the kitchen) (to Rachel) Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means ‘you are,’ Y-O-U-R means ‘your!’",
        "(starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind it)",
        "Oh, no-no-no don’t you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!",
        "What happened?",
        "Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.",
        "Huh, what’s fish hooking... (Joey sticks his finger in Ross’s mouth and pulls on his cheek, y'know like when you hook a fish.) (to Joey, sarcastic) Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?",
        "(on phone) That’s right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. (listens) Thank you. (hangs up) (to the gang) Yeah, we have the reservations.",
        "(stunned) Dude, what are you doing?",
        "All right so, Chandler, from now on, don’t give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don’t turn your back to him.",
        "(walking up with this huge tub-o-popcorn and drink) Hey!",
        "Yeah, it’s the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!",
        "Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.",
        "All right! You go get him! Let’s go!",
        "Hey! How long until Pete’s fight?",
        "Hot dog?",
        "What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn’t expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn’t expecting to like anyone right now, but she’s really terrific.",
        "No, I-I’m saying I liked her.",
        "Pheebs, I think she’s great. Okay? We’re going out again.",
        "Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.",
        "Okay, we’ll be right in. (to Chandler) So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?",
        "Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn’t want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can’t.",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something.",
        "No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.",
        "Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out. (starts to take off his pants)",
        "Come on you guys, it's no big deal! (He turns around and shows him his thing.)",
        "Well what is it? Is it a mole? (He moves closer to them, and they jump back.)",
        "Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?",
        "Ahhh.",
        "(entering) Hey guys!",
        "Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign.",
        "He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.",
        "At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name.",
        "(sarcastic) Yeah, that'd be cool!",
        "Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!",
        "Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.",
        "No?",
        "Well then, what is it?!",
        "Y'know I have dinner plans!!",
        "Yes, and the dimmer switch.",
        "Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom!",
        "Monica’s right. We’re talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can’t just rush into this.",
        "Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don’t want to make it savory.",
        "Gimme this. (Grabs the herbalist’s card and leaves.)",
        "Hi.",
        "Listen, I got to tell you I’ve-I’ve never been to a guru before, so...",
        "What’s a koondis?",
        "I guess it’s worth a try.",
        "What?! What?!",
        "We?! We angered it?!",
        "Oh God!",
        "Ow!!",
        "What was, what was that?",
        "What?! How’s that?",
        "Hey! (congratulates him)",
        "That’s too bad.",
        "Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?",
        "Yeah, I think she looks good.",
        "Go, go, go!",
        "Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.",
        "No-o-o! (Rachel gives him a \"Please?\" look.) No way! ",
        "Yeah well, if ah, if that’s the rule this weekend... (She gets\n      up) No!",

Yeah! Which gives me five, and let’s see who is gonna\n      lose their clothes. Ummmm, I think I pick our strip poker\n      sponsor Mr. Joey Tribianni.",
        "Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?",
        "Okay.",
        "Hey! (Rachel is shocked) Hi Bonnie!",
        "Oh.",

        "Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.",
        "Wh-haa-haa! Look what ‘cha did! (Rachel has her hand over her\n      mouth to keep from laughing.)",
        "Nooo, but it, but it’s great.",
        "Okay. (He gently touches it.) You can feel all the bones in\n      your skull.",
        "Hi.",
        "I was having a little chat with ah, Bonnie, and ah, guess what,\n      she-she happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um,\n      whole head shaving idea, and now, who was it? Oh, that’s right,\n      that’s right, it was you!",
        "She said you gave her the razor!",
        "Ahh, no, I’m good.",
        "Okay, have fun! Wooo!!",
        "You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head! What the hell\n      were you thinking?!!",
        "You don’t know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!",
        "Y'know, hey! You’re the one who ended it, remember?",
        "You still love me?",
        "You still love me.",
        "Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you\n      wanna, get back together?",
        "What?!",
        "What?",
        "That’s not true! Her, she doesn’t even know what she wants!\n      Rachel’s still mad about the whole thing.",
        "I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that\n      kiss!",
        "Good night.",
        "Okey-dokey!",
        "Hey, it’ll grow back, right? And she-she’s really fun, and she’s\n      cool, and-and I’m finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over\n      Rachel was so (makes an incoherent nasal sound), y'know? Y'know,\n      and I’m finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there,\n      and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her, and-and-and it\n      doesn’t work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through\n      that again?",

        "(to Rachel) I was just leaving.",
        "Why? Did you write it?",
        "Well ah, actually...",
        "Well, umm, why don’t you give him a call?",
        "Oh, I’m sure.",
        "(whispering in her ear) Oh, that’s right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that’s gotta be embarrassing! ",
        "(reading the newspaper) Hey, here’s a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?",
        "I’m reading your ad.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Good, so do I",
        "Are you sure she’s in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma’s glycoma medicine again?",
        "So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?",
        "So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?",
        "So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe’s mom remind anyone of a cat?",
        "Come on, you-you can’t tell me you actually believe that-that there’s a woman inside that cat!",
        "No you don’t. ",
        "No you do--y'know what, you’re not gonna suck me into this.",
        "I do not always have to be--okay, okay. (starts to leave)",
        "(taking the flyer) Apparently Phoebe’s mother also goes by the name Julio.",
        "Yes, we have to tell her!",
        "(holds up a hand) Little girl misses her cat. (hold up the other hand) Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. (gets up) Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.",
        "Thank you.",
        "(entering) Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?",
        "(seeing Phoebe still with cat) You didn’t tell her?! (They all kinda shy away.) Okay, fine! Pheebs?",
        "Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place.",
        "No! No! Look--Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!",
        "None.",
        "I’m sorry.",
        "I don’t know what to say.",
        "(goes over to Julio) Come here, here, come here, come here, (pause) Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend’s mother.",
        "Oh! Y'know, I’ve got an extra futon.",
        "Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don’t think Mom would’ve hired you if she didn’t think you were good at what you do.",
        "…I’m telling you it’s totally unconstituional.",
        "Hey!",
        "The volcano?",
        "With such a sad history.",
        "So why don’t you quit?",
        "Who is Maria?",
        "You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?",
        "So you’re strong enough to face her on your own?",
        "They make you take an oath?",
        "Then how do you explain the toe ring?!",
        "Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.",
        "One more time, \"Hey, don’t you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?\"",
        "Good! That’s good!",
        "Me? No.",
        "It’s okay man, be strong. (Chandler goes into the office.)",
        "No! And I’m not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.",
        "And that’s funny, why?",
        "Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.",
        "And that’s not against your oath?!",
        "Hello.",
        "We’d like to close our accounts.",
        "No-no.",
        "No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.",
        "(picking up the slip of paper) Hello! What's this? Oh right its that girl's phone number. (Rachel ignores him) Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me. (He holds it so that Rachel can see it, she continues to ignore him) It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but...(Rachel still ignores him) Whoa! (Throws it in her lap) Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby! Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it. (He waves it in front of Rachel's face. Then suddenly Phoebe has to sneeze and Rachel quickly grabs the slip of paper and gives it to Phoebe for her to sneeze into.)",
        "Oh, mine's December...",
        "Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.",

        "(loudly) So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!",
        "Oh.",
        "Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little \"playing\" ourselves.",
        "Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.",
        "Oh! (He bangs his fists together.)",
        "Monica knows.",
        "Well, I'm gonna go get ready, (Gives Monica the fist thing.) for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head.",

        "What?",
        "I-I-I...",
        "Who wants to make some long distance calls?",
        "Her date tipped me ten dollars. (Monica laughs)",
        "Pheebs, what are you doing?",
        "Are you serious?",
        "(entering) Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. (to Monica) So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?",
        "At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.",
        "You see Amanda and I have a very special...",
        "Fine.",
        "Here. (Hands her, her cough drops) (to Rachel) At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "(triumphantly) I’m gonna be on TV!!",

        "And I’m sure you’re gonna make a big impression. Hi! I’m Rachel\n      Green. It’s nice to meet you. (He lifts his leg and imitates\n      shaking hands with it, just like how Rachel was trying to pick\n      up the aspirin with her feet.) Come on, you probably have a\n      broken rib!",
        "Rach...",
        "Rachel...",
        "Fine. I’ll go.",
        "(He checks his watch) Sure. I’ll help you.",

        "(checks his watch) Sure, okay.",
        "What?",
        "Rachel, I’ve seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off\n      you naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your\n      belly button?",
        "Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.",
        "All I have to do is close my eyes. See? (closes his eyes) Woo-hoo!!",
        "Ah, I’m sorry.",

        "I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.",
        "Fine by me; hope she wins.",
        "How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?",
        "So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?",
        "(moved by the kiss) Huh...",
        "Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?",

        "Oh, yeah, why not?",
        "You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?",
        "Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! (Ross takes the loosely tied tie off and hands it to Joey who puts it on.) Here.",
        "What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.",
        "No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.",
        "I don't know. Soap?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, okay you're right.",

        "Department of Sanitation?",
        "Oh! (She kisses him) Ah. (They kiss more, and move down onto the couch. Ross's hand moves under some garbage) Aw! (His hand is covered with something brown and gooey.)",
        "(trying to make his disgust into lust) Ah, Cheryl!",
        "Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out.",
        "Y'know if we ever go to war and you’re captured, you’re in for a big surprise.",

        "Well umm, y’know, I used to play.",
        "Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that’s-that’s when I really found my sound.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven’t played in so long, and-and, well it’s-it’s really personal stuff, y’know?",
        "No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in—No, yeah, okay. (Runs out.)",
        "Okay, guys.",
        "Here we go. (Plays one note) Y’know, I’ve-I’ve never played my stuff for anyone before, so it’s important that-that you understand it’s about communicating very private emotions. (Plays another note) Y’know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That’s what I’m…",
        "Really?! I mean, really?!!",
        "Wow! Thanks, you guys. That’s uh—ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I’ll be right back! Okay? (Runs to fetch them) This is so nice, I’m—I am so… (starts to break up and leaves)",
        "(His voice is altered to sound like a computer.) Electrifying. (He plays the sound of a ticking clock.) Emphatic time-time-time…",
        "(with the altered voice) Thank you guys-guys-guys…",
        "(to Phoebe) Hey!",
        "Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don’t want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?",
        "Pheebs…",
        "See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y’know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I… I won’t play anymore.",
        "Yeah, okay.",
        "Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.",
        "What?",
        "No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would’ve just stepped aside.",
        "Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.",
        "Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.",
        "Thank you, thanks. (Sits down next to the girls) Yeah, I lost it. Y’know, I’m not gonna play anymore, (to Phoebe) would you, can you finish my set?",
        "Yeah, like I could lose it.",
        "I played bad on purpose guys.",
        "Yeah—no, just that last song.",
        "What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!",
        "I don’t know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there’s this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.",
        "Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?",
        "Dude, we are sooo gonna party!",
        "Mike \"Gandolf\" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world.",
        "I’m gonna call after you!",
        "Woooo!!!",
        "Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!",
        "Gandolf the wizard. (Joey is still confused) Hello! Didn’t you read Lord of the Rings in high school?",
        "(entering) Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!",
        "Whoa-whoa-whoa!",
        "Somewhere maybe along the equator?",
        "What happened?",
        "Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!",
        "It’s Gandolf, and he’s not coming.",
        "No! I balanced my checkbook.",
        "I can’t believe he didn’t come!",
        "Yeah! We’d meet, we’d meet total strangers, and hang out with them!",
        "There’s other stuff too.",

        "Yeah, me too.",
        "I’m just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y’know? I used them as mittens, I didn’t want to touch a thing in that last place.",
        "How sad are we?",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yeah!",
        "And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!",
        "Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?",
        "Now, how will they know if you’re ready?",
        "(He does so, and finds a half-eaten box of cookies.) You’re good. (Tries a cookie.) These are not.",
        "Five.",

        "They have another guess.",
        "How did you know she would buy scotch tape?",
        "Oh sure, \"Ross will do it!\" It’s not like he has a job, or a child, or a life of his own.",
        "No-no-no, I-I wanna play.",
        "The test is ready.",
        "Okay, each team will answer ten questions. The first team that answers the most questions wins. Okay, the categories are, Fears and Pet Peeves, Ancient History, Literature, and It’s All Relative. Now, the coin toss to see who goes first. (He flips the coin and they all watch it hit the table and stop. Then they all look up at him, to see who goes first.) Okay, somebody call it this time.",
        "It’s heads. (The guys celebrate.) Gentlemen, pick your category.",
        "What is Monica’s biggest pet peeve?",
        "That’s correct. Ladies?",
        "According to Chandler, what phenomenon scares the bejeezus out of him?",
        "That is correct.",
        "Gentlemen, you’re pick.",
        "Monica and I have a grandmother who died, you both went to her funeral, name that grandmother!",
        "Althea is correct.",
        "Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joey’s apartment. What name appears on the address label?",
        "I’m afraid the TV Guide comes to Chinandolor Bong.",
        "All right, the score is nine to eight in favor of the guys. Ladies if you miss this the game is theirs, pick your category.",
        "You don’t have to shout everything.",
        "Ooh. What is the name of Chandler’s father’s Las Vegas all-male burlesque?",
        "All right, we have a tie. Luckily, I have prepared for such an event. (He opens up an envelope and holds up some note cards.) The Lightning Round!",
        "Thirty seconds, all the questions you can answer.",
        "150 dollars.",
        "200 dollars.",
        "Excuse me.",
        "All right, gentlemen, you’re up first.",
        "You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round begins—stop it (Chandler stops jumping)—now. What was Monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?",
        "Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie…",
        "Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...",
        "Correct. In what part of her body did Monica get a pencil stuck at age 14?",
        "Eww! No!! Her ear! All right, Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?",
        "Two seconds…",
        "11, unbelievable 11 is correct. (The guys celebrate.) All right, that’s 4 for the guys. Ladies, you’re up.",
        "30 seconds on the clock. 5 questions wins the game. The lightning round begins…now! What is Joey’s favorite food?",
        "Correct. Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl’s breast?",
        "No, 19.",
        "Joey, had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?",
        "Correct, his profession was?",
        "Correct! What is Chandler Bing’s job?",
        "10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.",
        "Don’t blame the questions!",
        "What?",
        "Uh, actually Joey, it's the Cretaceous period.",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Pheebs, you're talking about putting your body through an awful lot. I mean, morning sickness, uh, labour. And it's all for somebody else.",
        "The stuff I just mentioned.",
        "Yeah, that is nice......lying!! No way is that the reason.",
        "And you're afraid you won't be able to *fill his shoes*. [grins]",
        "[stops grinning] Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.",
        "Just go for it Chandler.",
        "[waves back and takes something (a piece of chalk?) from his hand and pretends to make it disappear in his ear. He then makes it appear from his mouth.]",
        "[puts his tray on the table with the other scientists. He looks at the scientists and then at Joey.] That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later.",
        "[enters] Hey. (to Joey) Listen, I'm really really sorry about what happened today in the cafeteria.",
        "It's not just me. The scientists and the tour guides *never* sit together.",
        "It's like that everywhere Joey. Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work, the waiters eat with the other waiters and the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?",
        "Thank you Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table [puts tray down on middle table] in the middle. I'm having my lunch right here with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.",
        "You know, we work in the Museum of Natural History, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and you know what I see? I see division. Division between people with white coats and people in blue blazers. And I ask, myself, my God, WHY? Now I say, we shed these coats that separate us and get to know the people underneath. [He whips off his lab coat and throws it on the floor.] I'm Ross. I'm divorced, and I have a kid.",
        "All right, there you go.",
        "Okay, okay, good for you.",
        "[stammering] oh, uh, er, Wow, Rhonda.",
        "Ah, okay Scott!",
        "Hey!",
        "I’m sorry I’m late, did I miss anything?",
        "15? (Joey nods again) Your personal best! (Ross takes an Oreo and Joey mumbles, no!)",
        "Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.",
        "Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she’d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.",
        "No, I’m getting back down ‘cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she’s like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.",
        "Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.",
        "You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?",
        "Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can’t decide between the two of them. Y’know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she’s a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y’know she’s, well she’s-she’s just as pretty, I guess she’s smart, she’s not fun.",
        "Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y’know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was—if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn’t kidding, she’s not fun, she’s stupid, and kind of a racist.",
        "Hey!",
        "I wasn’t sleeping.",
        "The one with the cat. I gotta go, I’ve got another date.",
        "No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought—it wasn’t that funny. So I’m still torn.",
        "Y’know, you’re right. Thank you.",
        "(waking up) What? (notices that there is now a beautiful woman sitting next to him)",
        "What?",
        "(now fully awake) Are we really in Montreal?!",
        "Coffee sounds great. (They get up) Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?",
        "People can hear you.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That is one good looking man!",
        "Dude!",
        "Here’s your girlfriend’s button. (Holding the button.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates s*x with a real good lookin’ guy.",
        "Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.",
        "Yeah.",
        "They’re not a couple!",
        "Oh yeah!",
        "No.",
        "Y’know what, I don’t know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the s*x is between some guy and your girlfriend.",
        "Oh no-no-no, I’m there.",
        "Oh yeah!",
        "Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.",
        "All right, let’s not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.",
        "Here she comes. Don’t say a word, okay? Just be cool, don’t be…y'know you.",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, absolutely! (Chandler mumbles something.)",
        "Okay, I… (Walks away.)",
        "Uh, hello!",
        "Oh, yumm!",
        "Cookies and p0rn, you’re the best mom ever!!",
        "Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?",
        "Oh, whatever. (Laughs and gives Joey the thumbs up heading back to his apartment. Joey follows him)",
        "So you were right?",
        "Chandler!",
        "He’s right, what she did was unforgivable.",
        "How might you be wrong?",
        "That’s all you’re basing this on?",
        "So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?",
        "Oh my God!",
        "This is beautiful!",
        "Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?",
        "Hey!",
        "What are you saying?",
        "Well, if-if she thought they were on a break…",
        "Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?",
        "Who gets whom. (They all look at him.) I don’t know why I do that.",
        "Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!",
        "So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I’m already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.",
        "Really?! Wow! That’s-that’s so nice, what are you gonna get me?",
        "Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.",
        "Oh, that’s not true! I’ve got her lots of stuff she never took back.",
        "Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.",
        "Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh…",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Everything? Even the TV?",
        "Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don’t you think you could at least hear the guy out?",
        "That’s a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?",
        "You’ve sentenced him?!",
        "Joey, the guy’s your best friend.",
        "Oh, who? Me?",
        "Wow! I’m honored! And y’know what I’m gonna do as my first act as your best friend?",
        "I’m gonna get you to talk to Chandler.",
        "He’s coming here for Thanksgiving!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard’s son, you’d be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.",
        "(to Rachel) Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?",
        "I just wanna check something.",
        "(He puts his hand over the hole on the box.) (to Chandler) Now, we’ll see.",
        "(grabbing the necklace) The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver.",
        "Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!",
        "What did you get?",
        "Hey.",
        "Like ‘em, like ‘em? Or, I’d like to get store credit for that amount like ‘em?",
        "Sure! Oh, and Joey’s got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.",
        "There’s nothing the matter with me. See, I’m not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.",
        "I don’t know what to say, I’m sorry. Though, you’re not supposed to take these. (Points to the bone) It’s like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.",
        "He’s taking her purse!",
        "No, it’s really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.",
        "Help! Help!! Help! Help!!",
        "Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? (Imitating himself) Help! Help!",
        "Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something—or should I call it (In an English accent) football?",
        "What’s ah, what’s so funny about that?",
        "Well, we didn’t have freedom here until 1776, either so…",
        "Cheers!",
        "Oh, just hold on a second. I’m watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don’t know what the big deal is. I’m man enough to play this sport.",
        "(shocked) Hey!",
        "Hey, I can handle it! All right?",
        "That’s ‘cause-‘cause you’re mom’s dog kept-kept looking at me.",
        "And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?",
        "Well, you should’ve seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he’s like Joe Rugby.",
        "Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I’m gonna show her how tough I really am!",
        "Look, don’t worry about me. Okay? I’ll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I’ll uh, I’ll be that guy right out of the circle. (He points to a player who starts running and then gets viscously tackled from behind.)",
        "They don’t look any bigger than me!",
        "All right.",
        "Okay, I know what I have to do. I’ve got to go Red Ross. (Joey and Phoebe don’t know what he’s talking about.) Y’know, Red Ross!",
        "Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!",
        "You’ll see.",
        "JOEY!!!!!!",
        "Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!",
        "(to Emily) Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water?",
        "Thanks. (When she’s gone he collapses into Joey.) I-I think I’m dying. I really do.",
        "(to Phoebe) Tell my son that I love him. (Emily returns with the water.) Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!",
        "(whines \"No.\") That’s not true!",
        "What? No! No, I’m not stopping. I’m Red Ross!",
        "I don’t care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!",
        "No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.",
        "I like that.",
        "Huh?",
        "All right, bad ankle, got it!",
        "Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!",
        "But-but, Liam’s on my team.",
        "I’m gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in! (Squeals like a madman.)",
        "Oh no! That-that’ll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y’know what? I’m buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it’s in my pocket.",
        "No, not you. (Emily gets it.)",
        "Oh, I kinda was, wasn’t I?",
        "I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven’t done that since I was four and I washed my dad’s Porsche with rocks.",
        "Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose—I mean I-I’m not proud of it but, I really am. And it’s all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.",
        "No, no, I’m serious. Thank you.",
        "It’s worth the pain. (She goes to hug him again.) Y’know what, you know what? It’s not.",
        "Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Bye. (They kiss.)",
        "Oh yeah, she’s-she’s amazing. And-and she’s so much fun. And! Y’know what? When I’m with her, I’m fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes. (Chandler is shocked.) She’s leaving in two days, I don’t have to do it.",
        "Yeah, she’s got to go back to London. But you know what? I’ve been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that’s it. Y’know.",
        "Pheebs!",
        "(starts rubbing her belly) Hello! Hello!",
        "Well, as much as I’d like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren’t going to be here. All right? I mean, she’s going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I’ve got a whole special evening planned. So I’m sorry, no party.",
        "You really didn’t know?",
        "(interrupting Monica and Emily) So we should probably get going soon.",
        "Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y’know, then The Plaza for dinner.",
        "No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It’s usually, \"Surprise!\" And then, \"Oh my God, I’m so surprised—good-bye!\"",
        "Monica said that did she? (He squeezes Monica’s knee really hardly and Monica winces in pain.)",
        "Yes, we have something we have to get to.",
        "What big thing?",
        "(stopping them) Okay, that-that’s enough! Y’know, let’s, let’s let someone else play.",
        "Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.",
        "That’s okay. She’s still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it’s too late to do any of the things I had planned, so…",
        "Yeah.",
        "Helps a little.",
        "Yeah, have a seat.",
        "That’s okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn’t want it to end this way, y’know?",
        "What do you mean?",
        "Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment.",
        "You think?",
        "Hey, you’re right.",
        "Thanks. (He starts to go inside and stops.) What photo album was it?",
        "Oh my God! Those weren’t albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach! (He hurries inside and Chandler is taking out the garbage.)",
        "(pretend fishing in the living room) Ohh, Geller’s got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! (Swinging the rod back and forth) It’s the classic struggle between man and—(swings the rod and knocks over a lamp.) Someone knocked over a lamp.",
        "Because there are naked ladies there.",
        "There are naked ladies there too.",
        "Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take ‘em off and we’ll have some fun.",
        "Hi!",
        "Catch any big fish? (Phoebe, Ross, and Monica all go over to him.)",
        "Are you kidding?!",
        "He hasn’t gotten out of that chair in two days.",
        "Hey!",
        "Hi!",
        "No.",
        "You want me to take some girl I’ve never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.",
        "All right, I’ll do it.",
        "Please hurry.",
        "When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who wouldn’t be miserable? I’m telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.",
        "I’ve gotta go, there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard! (He hangs up and runs out.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Emily is…incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it, I mean the whole weekend was like a dream. (Sees Rachel coming back from the bathroom.) Oh! And you! Rach!",
        "Hey! You were so right!",
        "Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be happy for each other.",
        "I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn’t quite there. Y’know, I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy…",
        "Joshua…guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought of it kinda…y’know.",
        "But now! I’m there! I’m totally there! I’m-I’m finally where you are!",
        "Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily.",
        "Happy for you. (He punches her back.)",
        "Hi.",
        "So uh, Emily just went to the airport.",
        "Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y’know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so…",
        "(Thinks about it.) Nah.",
        "Well I, that’s the thing, I don’t know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said, (In a British accent.) \"This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let’s just enjoy…\"",
        "And why do you care so much?",
        "You had fantasies about Emily?",
        "Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?",
        "Ahh.",
        "We said it was only going to be two weeks, y’know?",
        "What-what is love really?",
        "I am a good kisser.",
        "Emily! (Runs up.)",
        "I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off.",
        "That’s, that’s, that’s a big candy bar. (She’s holding one of those huge Toblerone bars.) I had the most amazing time with you.",
        "(stops her) Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm, I’ve been thinking, I’m just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.",
        "That’s no problem.",
        "I did.",
        "Thank you.",
        "She said, \"Thank you.\" I said, \"I love you.\" And she said, \"Thank you.\"",
        "What do I do now?",
        "She already lives in London.",
        "Okay! Okay! But if she doesn’t call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y’know just to she what’s going on, and, and she says she’ll call me back, but then she doesn’t. Then it’s over.",
        "(Answers the phone.) Hello?",
        "Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?",
        "No, no, that-that, that’s all right. Umm, I’m just glad you called.",
        "Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?",
        "She doesn’t know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.",
        "Well…",
        "I’m not proving anything. Okay, I’m done listening to you. If I hadn’t let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would’ve put my fist through the wall!",
        "No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!",
        "What?",
        "I made fun of his accent.",
        "No.",
        "Really?",
        "All right. All right, I’m gonna do it!",
        "I’m gonna, I’m gonna go to London and I’m going to fight for her.",
        "(on phone) Hey.",
        "No, because she hasn’t come home yet. And she hasn’t been home all night! She’s obviously staying with that other guy, and I’m the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!",
        "About four hours.",
        "(yelling, thinking Emily can hear him through the answering machine all the way to New York.) I love you too! I’m, I’m gonna call you right now from the phone booth! (Realises) You can’t hear me. (Goes to make his call.)",
        "Hi.",
        "Ohh! Thank you.",
        "I Ross...",
        "Take thee, Rachel...(All his friends have looks of shock on their faces. He realizes what he said. Quickly he says.) Emily. (A slight chuckle.) Emily.",
        "I, Ross…",
        "Take thee, (Glares at the Minister) Emily. (Chuckles) Like there’d be anybody else. (Emily is glaring at him.)",
        "As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily. (Points at her.)",
        "Happy too.",
        "Yay!",
        "Okay.",
        "(laughs) That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn’t it?",
        "(exiting the bathroom) That-that-that’s all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I’ll be right out here. (She slams the door in his face, to the gang) She’s just fixing her makeup.",
        "And, I love you!! (He walks into the living room)",
        "That’s true, thanks dad. (To All) People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!! (He starts to dance but stops when no one else joins him.)",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh no! It could be better, but it’s gonna be okay, right?",
        "No! No! Of course it didn’t mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y’know, because-because it was you…",
        "But it absolutely didn’t. (Yelling towards the bathroom) It didn’t!! It didn’t!!",
        "(sarcastic) Oh! Oh-oh, the band’s ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says—I don’t care about the stupid band!!",
        "Look, I’m sorry.",
        "Oh, right!",
        "(Bangs on the bathroom door) Emily? Emily? I’m coming in. (He opens the door to reveal that the window is gone, along with Emily.)",
        "(entering) Emily?!",
        "No, I’ve looked everywhere!",
        "No! For all I know, she’s trying to find me but couldn’t because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I’m staying in one place. (He sits down on the bed.) Right here.",
        "Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?",
        "(disappointed) That’s cool.",
        "Thanks guys! (They both sit down on either side of him.) I really appreciate this, y’know, but you don’t have to rub my butt.",
        "Em-Emily? (Looking around for her.) Em-Emily? (He runs to the door.) Emily! (He opens the door to reveal the Walthams standing outside.)",
        "Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?",
        "Now, hold on! Hold on! (Stops him) Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I’m gonna be at that airport and I hope that she’ll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel’s name, but it didn’t mean anything, Okay? She’s-she’s just a friend and that’s all! (Rachel sits down, depressed.) That’s all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can’t imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you’ll tell her that.",
        "Rach! Rach!",
        "Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?",
        "Oh.",
        "Not yet.",
        "Pretty soon I guess.",
        "I just, I don’t understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y’know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she’d actually show up?",
        "Same difference.",
        "I get it! Well, that’s that.",
        "What?",
        "Oh, I don’t, I don’t, I don’t know…",
        "I could, yeah, I can do that.",
        "I can’t, I can’t even believe her! No, y’know what, I am, I am gonna go!",
        "I know, why not?",
        "Right?",
        "Y’know—thanks! (They hug)",
        "Yeah, well…nah.",
        "Why don’t you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?",
        "Yeah, yeah, it’ll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?",
        "No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.",
        "Okay!",
        "Cool!",
        "Come on! (They go to the jetway, Ross hands the tickets to the gate agent.) Here.",
        "Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!",
        "You tell them to wait!",
        "Emily.",
        "Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! (Emily starts to run out and Ross chases her.) No! No! Emily!",
        "Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.",
        "Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock’s a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?",
        "Hey, uh, you can ignore that.",
        "Uhh, believe me when he’s older, he’ll understand.",
        "I’ll be right there. (He goes over and opens the door to Carol, Susan, and Ben.) (To Ben.) Hello! (To Carol.) Hello! (To Susan.) Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan.",
        "Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so…",
        "Oh come on! That’s-that’s… true.",
        "Hey!",
        "So uh, Emily called last night…",
        "Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they’re going to the theatre together! They’re going to dinner! They’re going horseback riding!",
        "Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was: \"My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great.\"",
        "Hey, they’re going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y’know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful—didn’t you see Personal Best?",
        "How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!",
        "What a weird way to kick me when I’m down.",
        "Oh. What’s wrong with Ross?",
        "Actually that-that’s not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found… (Sees everyone staring at him and stops.) Y’know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend’s a lesbian. (Leaves.)",
        "(opening the door.) Hey!",
        "Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, \"No.\" I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, \"No.\" I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, \"No.\" So, he’s sweeping. (We see Ben playing with a broom and a dustpan.)",
        "So umm, any word from Susan?",
        "Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don’t know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?",
        "Y’know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.",
        "Am I?!",
        "Am I?!",
        "Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y’know? Say-say they’re coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they’re laughing, y’know, someone innocently touches someone else… There’s electricity, it’s new. It’s exciting. Are you telling me there isn’t even the slightest possibility of something happening?",
        "OH MY GOD!! I didn’t really believe it until you just said it!!",
        "(returning from the phone.) So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!",
        "So! Poetry? Susan’s gay! They’re being gay together!",
        "Oh, wake up!",
        "Excuse me?",
        "Look, I don’t know what you’re talking about, I am not a crazy, jealous person.",
        "What?",
        "It does not!",
        "This is not fun!",
        "Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.",
        "Nice luggage.",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh, I missed you too.",
        "(To Carol) No tongue. (And gives her the thumbs up.)",
        "(entering) Hey guys!",
        "Oh no, not yet.",
        "Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?",
        "Yeah—oh! Hey listen umm, Emily found this wedding dress in London…",
        "Yeah, but it didn’t fit. Well, luckily there’s a store here that has one left in her size, but I’m the groom, I’m not supposed to see the dress…",
        "Thank you.",
        "What’s wah-pah?",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey, do uh, do you have a minute?",
        "So listen uh, I know you and I haven’t really had a chance to talk since uh, Emily and I decided to get married, and uh, I was just wondering how you were.",
        "I know if you were getting married I’d feel, kinda….. y’know.",
        "Yeah?",
        "All right, I just wanted to check.",
        "You’re great. And I-I know someday this will happen for you too. You just hang in there.",
        "Oh, no, I didn’t mean, uh…",
        "Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didn’t realise that had become anything, yet.",
        "Oh. Yeah?",
        "Wow, that’s-that’s-that’s incredible.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "I gotta get to work.",
        "Hey, y’know, y’know what would make me really happy?",
        "If like the four of us could all y’know, hang out together. Uh, in fact Emily’s coming into town this weekend, why don’t you say we all have dinner? Say, Sunday night?",
        "Yeah, all right, it’s a date. (He leaves)",
        "(coming back in) Did you say something?",
        "Hey man.",
        "So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?",
        "Great! Because Emily and I are getting married in a month!",
        "Yep!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it’s going to be torn down, so… I mean, I-I know it’s crazy, but everything up ‘til now has been so crazy, and I don’t know, this just feels right. Y’know?",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about, Ernie’s at 9 o’clock?",
        "Oh, see I-I don’t know if we’re gonna be hungry at three.",
        "What happened?",
        "Noo. Why?",
        "Oh, Rachel, I’m-I’m sorry.",
        "Come here.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You okay?",
        "It's all right.",
        "Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!",
        "Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.",
        "Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's gonna be okay.",
        "Yeah, he's head of the department.",
        "Hello.",
        "Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?",
        "To be fair, he doesn’t seem to be impersonating Fonzie…",
        "Again, it's not that he…",
        "Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.",
        "(entering) Hey! I just heard. What's up?",
        "Breathe! Breathe! Breathe throw the pain.",
        "I do too! I do too!",
        "Argh!",
        "Argh!",
        "You did it, man.",
        "Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe? (Shakes his head around, pretending like he’s jamming.)",
        "Uh, I don’t know, whatever.",
        "Oh, I know. Y’know what, I never would’ve gotten this if it weren’t for you. No really, when I’m with you I’m-I’m like this whole other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love that guy!",
        "Yeah?",
        "Then don’t. Stay here. Just don’t go so soon to London, just one more day.",
        "One more day, seriously/",
        "So, then you can stay as long as you want.",
        "Oh no. Don’t, don’t, don’t start packing. Come on! (She puts some clothes into her bag, and Ross throws them out.)",
        "Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on.",
        "No. No, I didn’t. I didn’t want to be that guy.",
        "(entering) Hey, guys! (They both notice his new little friend)",
        "Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.",
        "I like it, and Emily likes it, and that’s what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing?",
        "Ugh, she’s saying good-bye to her uncle.",
        "Yeah!! Yeah!",
        "I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it’s-it’s so great. But at the same time I’m thinking, \"Well, I’m gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off.\"",
        "Nothing! There’s nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she’d have to uh, move here. She should move here!",
        "I could ask her to live with me!",
        "I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!",
        "Look guys, when I’m with her it’s-it’s-it’s like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y’know?",
        "I don’t want to do that.",
        "Yeah, no, you’re right, I know, you’re right, I’m not, I’m not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys. (Gets up to leave.)",
        "Hey!",
        "(laughs) Move in with me.",
        "Don’t be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it’s too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.",
        "I know.",
        "Well, so, you-you’ll get a job here! I mean, I’m always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!",
        "No, I can’t. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can’t leave him. Isn’t—you don’t think there’s any way?",
        "What?",
        "No, no, don’t. Why don’t we?",
        "Get married.",
        "No! No! I’m not! It’s-it’s-it’s perfect! I mean it’s better than you just-just moving here, ‘cause it’s us together forever, and that’s-that’s what I want.",
        "Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who’s-who’s to say? Does that me we-we can’t do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn’t it?",
        "Is that—are you saying yes? Is that yes?",
        "Yes! We’re getting married?!",
        "Yes!",
        "Come here, come here. Uh, (He takes the earring out.) ow! Emily, will you marry me?",
        "Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!",
        "Come on! Come on. Come on.",
        "Hey!",
        "Uhh, okay, it’s uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.",
        "We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.",
        "(turning around.) Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys…",
        "Yeah. (They hug again.)",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Yeah! (They high-five.)",
        "Ohh…",
        "Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.",
        "Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?",
        "Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?",
        "Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'know--Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?",
        "No, not since I lost her at the airport.",
        "HEY, SHE'S FAST!! OKAY?!! (Chandler is so shocked at Ross's outburst that he drops his spoon and backs up) Oh! You-you think you can be beat me? Let's go! Outside!!",
        "Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.",
        "That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.",
        "So, what? That's it?",
        "Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best. (They hug.)",
        "(breaking the hug) Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! (Runs to the door.) Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.",
        "Hi.",
        "She's doing her laundry.",
        "It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!",
        "Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.",
        "I can't catch a break!",
        "What thing?",
        "Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. (Looks at the rose mulch.) My God, think of the massacre.",
        "Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!",
        "Wait! It was my plan.",
        "And, I came up with Atlantic City.",
        "The paper.",
        "Events from around the globe.",
        "Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized…",
        "Yeah.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "Wow. Umm… Huh… I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.",
        "What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.",
        "Why are you laughing?",
        "Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.",
        "Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where my wife is. (Laughs) \"Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?\" Don't know!",
        "Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is…",
        "That is what the thing is.",
        "No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.",
        "No thank you for… Thank you.",
        "Okay, let's go!",
        "Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now.",
        "Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he’s so cheap, he’d never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough? (Hands her some envelopes.)",
        "Yeah?",
        "Sure. Why not?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn’t invite her?",
        "Yeah sure.",
        "Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.",
        "I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!",
        "Hi. ",
        "You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.",
        "You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.",
        "Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?",
        "Okay... okay, maybe I will...",
        " See, I see.... big passion in your future.",
        "I do.",
        "Hey, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.",
        "OK. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um....",
        "Yes, yes, that's right...",
        "What? [the cat jumps on his shoulders] Ow!",
        "You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.",
        "Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? [Ross turns and bangs his head on an open dryer door.] I'm fine, I'm fine.",
        "You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.",
        "I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.",
        "The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.",
        "Fine.",
        "Good.",
        "No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I’m happy for ya, but I’m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don’t know what to do anymore.",
        "Is this about Mark?",
        "Okay, it’s not, it’s not.",
        "Oh I’m, I’m making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.",
        "Okay, okay, fine, you’re right. Let’s ah, let’s take a break, (goes to the door) let’s cool off, okay, let’s get some frozen yogart, or something.. (opens the door)",
        "Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? (He’s frantically throwing the cushions off of the couch looking for her other shoe) Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!! ",
        "Yeah!",
        "Oh, thank you. (She goes to kiss him, but he holds her coat up between their faces to stop her.) Hey, hey. (opens the door, sees Rachel, and hides Chloe behind the door) Rachel!!!!",
        "Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.",
        "Yes, you can, very much.",
        "(seeing the thumbs up) Ahhhh!! (Hugs Rachel tighter.)",
        "No!!",
        "No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.",
        "What?",
        "She was...",
        "She, she was different.",
        "Nobody likes change.",
        "What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.",
        "WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!",
        "Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment.",
        "You think?",
        "Hey, you’re right.",
        "But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.",
        "Oh, that is so sweet.(listens) No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three.(He doesn't hang up and motions for Rachel to be quiet.) Well you didn't hang up either.",
        " Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y-- (Rachel grabs the phone and hangs it up for him.)",
        "Rach, I got a message from you.",
        "You're over me?",
        "Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?",
        "When, when were you... under me?",
        "OK, I need to lie down.",
        "Really. It's always been you, Rach.",
        "I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.",

        "I can’t ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that? (Holds out his pants)",

This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- (TO WAITRESS, WHO HAS BROUGHT HER COFFEE)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realised that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, he always looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.

        "Nooo! (TAKES THE PHONE; CHANDLER TAKES HER PLACE) Hello? Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.",
        "I've got magic beans. Never-never mind.",
        "Ohhh... I'm fine.",
        "(READING THE PROGRAMME) Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!",
        "God. I feel violated.",
        "Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!",
        "What is it?",
        "Tah-daaah!",
        "Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.",
        "Well, whaddya think?",
        "I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.",
        "Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.",
        "..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?",
        "Who is being loud?",
        "Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?",
        "Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.",
        "Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?",
        "Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?",
        "Oh, yeah, I've done that.",
        "I've never done that.",
        "Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just don't get along?",
        "So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?",
        "Well, isn't that gonna be weird?",
        "Oh, cool. \"Urkel\" in Spanish is \"Urkel\".",
        "Well someone was supposed to write \"Rache, take down the lights\" and put it on the refrigerator. How long has that been there?",
        "So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?",
        "Ok. Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree & Evelyn?",
        "Oh, well, that shouldn't be so hard, now that you're dating. Sweetheart, you're fired, but how 'bout a quickie before I go to work.",
        "You don't even have cats.",
        "We'll try to keep it down.",
        "Are you seein' her again tonight?",
        "It's just occurring to you?",
        "Oh, you're gonna be great!",
        "Oh, how'd she take it?",
        "Ok, Pheebs, can I ask? So, he's going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?",
        "No.",
        "Please, they've been going out a week. They haven't even slept together yet, I mean, that's not serious.",
        "No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so I'm takin' 'em down. Ok? Whoa! (She falls off the balcony)",
        "I'm ok! I'm ok! Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?",
        "Oh, that is so sick.",
        "Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...",
        "Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...",
        "Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!",
        "Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?",
        "Why?",
        "All right. All right all right all right all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!",
        "Wow... Wow!",
        "I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.",
        "Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...",
        "Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.",
        "Well, what about Mindy?",
        "No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?",
        "No. No no no no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me. ",
        "Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..",
        "I had a bra.",
        "What?!",
        "Pretty well, actually... (WANDERING INTO KITCHEN)",
        "Oh, do I?",
        "(LOW VOICE)....We ended up having s*x in his chair.",
        "I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol.",
        "Please. If she said to you, \"Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now\", what would you say? ",
        "Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. Really? Oh. Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... okay... great... great... all right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! Okay.. okay... bye. (SITS DOWN HEAVILY) Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.",
        "Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry... (DOES SO) Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be!",
        "Get down?",
        "Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.",
        "Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..",
        "And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..",
        "Right, I'll see you guys later...",
        "Mindy.",
        "Hey, you.... So, what's up?",
        "Sure we should... So.",
        "Okay.",
        "Of course!",
        "Was that all you wanted to ask me?",
        "Ohhhh!! (MINDY STARTS TO SOB) ...What? What?",
        "Oh sure it is!",
        "Um, what- what would make you think that?",
        "(DRAWS BACK) Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.",
        "What? What's what you were afraid of?",
        "What?",
        "Uh.. Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.",
        "(OFFERS HER ARM TO MINDY. SHE SNIFFS) Smell familiar?",
        "Oh, I am so sorry.",
        "Hey. Got a second?",
        "Uh, we are here to break up with you.",
        "Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?",
        "Even when we were having s*x in that chair?",
        "Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!",
        "Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.",
        "Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels GREAT.",
        "What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!",
        "Oh God. ",
        "And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.",
        "You DON'T KNOW?",
        "Originally written by Marta Kauffman and David Crane\nTranscribed by Mindy Mattingly Phillips [mmatting@indiana.edu]\nOw ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.",

        "You.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that. Monica: You don't have insurance?",
        "Why, how much is this gonna cost?",
        "Well what are we gonna do?",
        "Um, unless, unless I use yours.",
        "Well, now, wait a second. Who did I just put as my \"In case of emergency\" call person?",
        "Well, all right, then, forget it. Might as well just go home. Ow!",
        "Thank you. Thank you. I love you.",
        "Hi, this is my friend Rachel.",
        "Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?",
        "I meant young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh, Good Rach.",
        "Right.",
        "So, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.",
        "Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said yes.",
        "What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, cute doctors, doctors who are cute!",
        "Was that the cake?",
        "I hope it's ok.",
        "Ok, coming!",
        "Oh, that's great. Look at that.",
        "You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you. Well, listen, why don't you two sit down, and we'll get you some glasses....STAT.",
        "Ok, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are. I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine, I really do.",
        "Would you stop being such a wuss?",
        "I am not a baby. You know what?",
        "You know what?",
        "Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.",
        "I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.",
        "Uh, I'm a uh, chef at a restaurant uptown.",
        "Yeah it is. Mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.",
        "And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow.",
        "I use my breasts to get other people's attention.",
        "Daddy, daddy, why? Why would I sleep with Billy Drestin? His father tried to put you out of business! You are dead!",
        "Hello? Uh, yeah, uh, hold on a second. Let me see if she's here. It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. Oh, god, what do we do, what do we do?",
        "No, you do it.",
        "What?",
        "You were right, this was just not worth it.",
        "Ok, let me just change.",
        "Hi, remember us?",
        "And I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.",
        "I know. I'm just not that bright either.",
        "What?",
        "Oh.",
        "Hi.",
        "No.",
        "Shut up!",
        "All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were...",
        "Well, you were pretty damnedy good.",
        "Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.",
        "Get off.",
        "What are you playing with?",
        "Off to see young Ethan?",
        "Just a touch. Mon, I donīt understand. I mean, youīve been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.",
        "Could tonight be the Night?",
        "So, did you shave your legs?",
        "Aha!",
        "No, forget it.",
        "All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. [Camera fades to Ross, whoīs listening very carefully] Joey was there too.",
        "No.",
        "No, it was just the three of us.",
        "He, he, he. You know what?",
        "There were times when it wasnīt even me.",
        "Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?",
        "Ethan called again.",
        "I, I didnīt say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear.",
        "Where are you going?",
        "[understands that Monica and Ethan wanna be alone] Hey, did you guys check out those new handdryers in the bathroom?",
        "True story.",
        "Letīs dry īem again.",
        "[talks in her sleep] Oooooooooh. [Rachel strokes her hand over the pillow. Ross mimicks her silently] Oh, thatīs nice. Oh, oh. Huh, Ross.",
        "Ross?",
        "You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just...",
        "What?",
        "What?",
        "I donīt know where the phone is.",
        "Ross?",
        "What, so I canīt lokk nice? There might be doctors there.",
        "Rossy, Rossy.",
        "Oh my god. Oh my god. Excuse me. Emergency! Excuse me!",
        "Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you?",
        "What?",
        "I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. I wanna hear everything!",
        "These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country.",
        "Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.",
        "Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.",
        "You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes!",
        "And the chicken poops in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.",
        "Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?",
        "Yeah, sure.",
        "Did you talk to him?",
        "Then, no.",
        "Here's your lemonade.",
        "Oh. Well than, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.",
        "Go go go go, come on! Well, what did you find out?",
        "Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.",
        "Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.",
        "I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here.",
        "Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?",
        "Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.",
        "Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.",
        "I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.",
        "At his apartment. Is this juice?",
        "I know, I know I'm a pathetic loser.",
        "Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?",
        "I'm glad it's not a problem.",
        "How is she?",
        "I'm ok.",
        "When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, then 50 feet of crap, then me.",
        "Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?",
        "I don't know, I don't know.",
        "Wait, are you leaving?",
        "Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all, what?",
        "No.",
        "No, I think that was the whole all.",
        "No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andy McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.",
        "You're welcome.",
        "Yeah, I forget which ones.",
        "Thank you. What a bitch.",
        "Hey, guys, what's up.",
        "Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?",
        "You went shopping for fur?",
        "You bought boobs?",
        "Oh, this is so cute.",
        "Did you just say Hi, Jew?",
        "Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.",
        "They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?",
        "Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon. Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?",
        "And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket",
        "Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?",
        "Who?",
        "What?",
        "You were with Julie?",
        "Oh. Oh my god.",
        "Yeah, right.",
        "Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.",
        "Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?",
        "Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdales? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now.",
        "Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.",
        "Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually, but now she's actually stealing you.",
        "I love you too.",
        "I'd do anything for you, you know that.",
        "So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?",
        "Really? Me?",
        "Well, you're not totally paranoid.",
        "Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.",
        "Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.",
        "All right, Julie. What a manipulative bitch.",
        "Come on, they were not that huge.",
        "You don't have birds.",
        "All right, bye-bye.",
        "\"Oh, my, god.\"",
        "We won. We won!",
        "How did this happen?",
        "Ok, so let's talk money.",
        "Have you ever seen so much crap?",
        "Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.",
        "What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.",
        "Well, what about my stuff?",
        "You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?",
        "Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.",
        "Ok, while you \"mmm\" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.",
        "What?",
        "Monica, let it go.",
        "Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.",
        "I am. Let me just get my coat.",
        "Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?",
        "Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.",
        "Ok, you win.",
        "Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.",
        "She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.",
        "Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.",
        "You are ready to make a commitment!",
        "What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?",
        "Thank you.",
        "It's really not that big!",
        "[entering hurriedly] Did I miss it? Did I miss it?",
        "I'm sorry, what?",
        "That's great!",
        "What do you mean?",
        "Ok, who ordered what?",
        "Oh god.",
        "I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?",
        "Mom!",
        "Pretty much.",
        "This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.",
        "Oh Mom!",
        "Really?",
        "Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.",
        "I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?",
        "For...me.",
        "Well, what do you mean?",
        "Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.",
        "None.",
        "No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?",
        "I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.",
        "Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?",
        "These are from Halloween three years ago.",
        "No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.",
        "Actually, what I think you said was, \"don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen.\"",
        "Hey, Mon, you want some help?",
        "She's still with you?",
        "God!",
        "Oh! What's new in s*x?",
        "Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?",
        "You want me to talk you out of it?",
        "Then what? What do you want?",
        "Why on earth would I understand this?",
        "Oh.",
        "Hey, Mom? Having fun?",
        "There's more alcohol, right?",
        "I had a wedding.",
        "Hi you guys.",
        "Hey you.",
        "So, uh, how was your day?",
        "Really? Mine too.",
        "OK. [they go to kiss but everyone's watching so Ross just kisses her on the top of her head and leaves]",
        "It is our first official date. Our first date.",
        "Hi.",
        "God, oh God Monica, I forgot. This is our first date.",
        "Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. See Phoebe, Phoebe.",
        "C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I'm just saying, you know, it was a little. . . hard to follow.",
        "I know, I just didn't want to wear my glasses on my first date.",
        "Monica.",
        "Honey, I'm just checking.",
        "Monica.",

        "What? [in surprise she forgets she has the pigeon in the pot and lets it get away]",
        "What!",
        "Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?",
        "[to Monica at the counter] Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.",
        "Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.",
        "Bye-bye Julie. [Julie leaves]",

        "Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?",
        "No, no no no, don't need to know the details.",
        "No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think?",
        "I think it's sexy.",
        "Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have s*x.",
        "Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?",
        "I'd wait.",
        "Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more.",
        "Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have s*x with, with another man. That just means it's working.",
        "More than jewelry. [Rachel struts off, extremely pleased with herself]",
        "Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?",
        "What did, what did he say?",
        "Great, people having s*x, that's just what I need to see.",
        "Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.",
        "No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.",
        "Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?",
        "Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna hear everything.",
        "So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?",
        "OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?",
        "Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.",
        "Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?",

        "Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce?",
        "Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.",
        "Maybe you should put it off.",
        "I know, yeah, sorry.",
        "Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that.",
        "Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen.",
        "And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.",
        "Ohh, God.",
        "Ok.",
        "What's up?",
        "But what about Phoebe?",

        "Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look, look. Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything.< br>\nTERRY: I, I don't know. ",

        "Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for \"Smelly Cat\".",
        "Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.",
        "Hey.",
        "Uhh, the mailman, the super.",

        "Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.",
        "How have you never been on Oprah?",
        "Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.",
        "No, nothin'.",

        "NO!",
        "No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?",
        "No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.",
        "Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?",

        "Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.",
        "Here are your cakes.",
        "No, I know, they're from me. Look you guys this is not good. I mean we have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking it from each other.",

        "Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.",
        "Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal s*x. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.",
        "Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.",
        "God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...",

        "That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it.",
        "Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo. [she bends over and bears her tattoo right when Ross returns]",

        "It was nice to meet you.",
        "So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?",

        "I'll say.",
        "Well then uh, we better make this night count. [He starts to carry her out.] Oh wait, I forgot to turn off the cappucino machine. [He carries her over to turn it off.] Anchors away. Oh no no, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my pu rse. [He carries her to the counter to pick up her purse.] Oh, you know what. I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.",

        "Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?",
        "Hey, how'd the interview go?",
        "So don't do it.",

        "Noo.",
        "Oohhh.",
        "Hi. [Ross turns to Rachel and they hug]",
        "What?",
        "Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the stock market.",
        "We love you, we're here for you.",
        "Ohh, what is in that?",
        "No no, 'cause mayo, that would make it gross.",
        "Run Phoebe run.",
        "Are you kidding me?",
        "Ok, here, I know what we can do. [grabs Joey's sadwich and throws it out the window]",
        "Ok, doggie get the- aahhh. Ok go get the sandwich, get the sandwich doggie. [dog ignores the sandwich] Good doggie get the sandwich, get the...ok, Joey, the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich, what does that say?",

        "How did you make $17.",
        "What happened to uh, MEG.?",
        "Hey Phoebs. Oh hey, how's the dog?",
        "Oh, thank God.",
        "Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?",
        "She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.",
        "Why the voice.",
        "What?",
        "For what?",
        "Why, when did you get out of the game?",
        "Oh no.",

        "Nobody does honey.",
        "Look at her.",
        "Agh, it was the graduation from hell.",
        "Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.",
        "My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.",
        "Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner.",
        "Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you.",
        "Now I love you even more.",
        "Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great.",
        "Wow you, you. I had no idea.",
        "No, I knew.",
        "What?",
        "Why.",
        "Daddy.",
        "Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?",
        "I can't believe this is happening.",
        "I do.",
        "Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.",
        "What?",
        "Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while.",
        "Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok.",
        "Well those are very popular frames.",
        "Yeah, like a chimney.",
        "You want me to see a therapist?",
        "Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing.",
        "Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.",
        "This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?",
        "Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.",
        "It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...",
        "Oh ok.",
        "Ok.",
        "Ok, I've got one. [blows out the candles. Somebody calls out 'heads up' and the volleyball lands in the flan] Wow, those things almost never come true.",
        "Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.",
        "What song was that, Pheebs?",
        "Hey Mon!",
        "No, it's been three nights in a row.",
        "What?!",
        "Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.",
        "Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute.",
        "Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?",
        "(she leans over and kisses him on the cheek) Honey, I was wondering....",
        "Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?",
        "Hmm.",
        "You remember not having s*x in high school, right?",
        "Well honey, what about you?",
        "I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?",
        "Come on you gotta have one!",
        "Ross, you know what...",
        "...if you tell me, I might do it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oooh!",
        "Really!",
        "Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?",
        "Really! That-that great huh?",
        "Hi you guys!",
        "Mon. Hi!",
        "Why aren't you at work?",
        "Why?",
        "You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.",
        "Hi.",
        "What?",
        "Oh, really, let me see, let me see.",
        "Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.",
        "Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?",
        "Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.",
        "Were both of those Joey?",
        "Not even with your best friend.",
        "That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.",
        "Pretty much.",
        "Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.",
        "Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What?",
        "What?",
        "That's not the end.",
        "Hey Phoebs, whatcha got there?",
        "Hey.",
        "Wow, he must like you the best.",
        "No luck huh?",
        "Oh, yeah sure, Ok. [she takes Ben and holds him at arms length]",
        "Uh, I'm holding Ben.",
        "Ok.",
        "This is how I would hold a football.",
        "Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I haven't been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one.",
        "Really?",
        "What?",
        "You think about stuff like that?",
        "Two, two babies?",
        "Then what's gonna happen?",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.",
        "I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this [hands back Ben] and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot. I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door? [leaves]",
        "[enters] Aghh.",
        "Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.",
        "I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.",
        "Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks.",
        "Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be.",
        "What was the book?",
        "Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.",
        "But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I didn't know that.",
        "Fine, I will.",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "Well I love you too.",
        "Yes it is.",
        "Well you better.",
        "Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter.",
        "Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben? Yes we can, yes we can. [finishes the diaper] There. I did it. I did it. Look at that, oh, stays on and everything. Hi.",
        "I'm sorry, what did you just say? Did you just say hi? Oh my God, Ross, Ross, Ben just said 'Hi'.",
        "Ben just said hi.",
        "Ye-, no, my Uncle Hi.",
        "Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just bring it out in him.",
        "Guess what. Ben just said his first word.",
        "You know, actually it's more like, hi.",
        "Hi.",
        "Hi.",
        "Hi.",
        "Take care.",
        "Did, did he just, did he, did he just say, he said bye. He said bye. You said, you said bye to me. You said bye to me.",
        "Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?",
        "Yeah, right.",
        "I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.",
        "Because I promised Mindy I would.",
        "Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor. And besides you know what I just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.",
        "Nooo!",
        "Wow! What's that like?",
        "Afraid to ask him?",
        "Hey!",
        "Hi.",
        "Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.",
        "God I know, you're right.",
        "Okay, I'll see you after the thing.",
        "Thank you, Okay, Okay. ",
        "Why the hell didn't you tell me!",
        "Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.",
        "Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.",
        "Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.",
        "Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.",
        "Oh, hi!",
        "I know.",
        "Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.",
        "Yeah, I love that story. Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about?",
        "Insane!",
        "What?!",
        "What.",
        "Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?",
        "Oh dear God.",
        "(to Ross) She you in the parking lot.",
        "(after a pause with everyone staring at her, she goes up to the microphone) Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings (da-doom-chesh). See now, tonight, all I\nreally wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity. Well (laughing), I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen. There's nothing really left to say except....(starts singing) \"Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl. With yellow feathers (band joins in), feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there. She would...\"",
        "(singing) \"...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody..\"",
        "At the Copa, Copa Cabana (everyone joins in) The hottest spot north of Havana. At the Copa, Coo-pa Ca-ban-a, music and fashion were always the passion, at the Copa....",
        "Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.",
        "(joining Phoebe outside) Hey Pheebs.",
        "Any sign of your brother?",
        "I thought you only met him once?",
        "Well relax, he’ll be here.",
        "Well, actually Gunther sent me. You’re not allowed to have cups out here, it’s a thing. (takes her cup and goes back inside)",
        "Now, you do realize that she’s a cartoon, and way out of your league?",
        "Oh, I don’t know, I guess, Chris O’Donnel, John F. Kennedy, Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson.",
        "Hardy Boy.",
        "What about you honey, who would be on your list?",
        "Hi!",
        "Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?",
        "Three of your five, what?",
        "Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.",
        "So?",
        "Yeah, ‘cause that’s why you won’t get Isabella Rosselini, geography.",
        "Well, it’s about time.",
        "All right let me see. (grabs the card) Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel?",
        "Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice.",
        "Oh!",
        "Come on!",
        "Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? (the guy nods) Okay, great. (she starts to walk away and under her breath) You freak.",
        "Oh-oh, you lie.",
        "Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.",
        "You know what honey, you go ahead, we’ll call her an alternate.",
        "Okay.",
        "Honey, he’s about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I’m just sorry we don’t got popcorn.",
        "I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he’s Alan Alda.",
        "‘Okay. (listens) Okay, daddy we’ll see you tomorrow night. (listens) Okay bye-bye.’ (hangs up)",
        "Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that’s okay.",
        "Ross, my father doesn’t hate you.",
        "But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do. (Ross looks at her) All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I’ll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Hi Daddy!",
        "You remember Ross.",
        "Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.",
        "Okay.",
        "Aw honey stop! It’s not that bad.",
        "Yeah. That’s Daddy.",
        "Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I’d be serving him sneezers.",
        "So. Ross, I’ve bugged him about this a million times, he’s not gonna change.",
        "Well um, I don’t.",
        "Yeah it is, it is. (to Ross) We really, really have to do something about that.",
        "Oh Daddy, no he didn’t mean anything by that, he really didn’t.",
        "You had to do it, didn’t you? You couldn’t just leave it alone.",
        "Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. (Ross groans and rubs his neck) Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.",
        "Um. yeah.",
        "All right, look, here’s the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I’ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.",
        "Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that’s why you have got to be the bigger man here.",
        "Okay, well can’t you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?",
        "Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don’t wanna have to have a separate room for you too!! (starts to cry)",
        "(opening the door) Hi Daddy.",
        "What? What? He’s interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here.",
        "What?!",
        "He’s got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...",
        "Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.",
        "Well that’s his last name.",
        "It’s Robert Bobby.",
        "And um, excuse me, he helps me.",
        "With my alignment. I’ve got one leg shorter than the other.",
        "What? It’s true, my right leg is two inches shorter.",
        "I’m sorry, let her?",
        "No.",
        "Yeah honey, I’m standing right there! Why didn’t you just tell him about the mole I haven’t got checked yet.",
        "Noo way, Kevin.",
        "Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with\n        his doll? (uses the Milk Master 2000 to pour milk into her\n        cereal)",
        "What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?",
        "Men are unbelievable.",
        "Amazingly, that makes sense.",
        "Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies\n        and pretend agents.",
        "Very nice touch.",
        "Unbelievable.",
        "Honey, this will help. (hands him a tub of ice cream)",
        "Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's\n        not so bad. How did you leave it?",
        "Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We\n        sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal\n        cases.",
        "Yeah, you do.",
        "This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself\n        reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get\n        your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to\n        start acting aloof.",
        "Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally\n        run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.",
        "Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.",
        "Oh.",
        "G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?",
        "Yeah, it is.",
        "Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yes, and grumpy.",
        "He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with\n        somebody else by now.",
        "What?!!",
        "Excuse me, there was no time!",
        "Does anybody need more coffee?",
        "(sitting at a table with some of her friends) (to waitress) Oh, um, no, no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I don’t think this is.",
        "That’s all right. (to her friends) I mean hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh?",
        "Ummm, I think it’s time to see the ring again. (holds her hand out and they all scream)",
        "Yeah, I know.",
        "Oh, I don’t know. Well maybe it’s just the idea of Barry for the rest of my life. I don’t know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling, y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system. (Chandler is listening in very intensely)",
        "I’m serious, I really, I think I need just to have some...meaningless, s*x y'know, with the next guy that I see.",
        "Yeah, so?",
        "Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think? (shows her, her ring)",
        "Yes, his name is Barry, he’s a doctor, thank you very much.",
        "Thank you. So how-how ‘bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?",
        "Oh, but that’s okay.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. (points at Chandler, who holds up the cue ball as a ‘Remember me?’ thing) Listen, can we please have lunch the next time I’m in the city?",
        "Okay!",
        "Bye!",
        "Don’t say anything. I don’t wanna speak, I don’t wanna think. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.",
        "What?",
        "Oh, sorry.",
        "Um, (shyly) Barry.",
        "Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special\n        homemade brownies? ",
        "Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!",
        "And all these people actually died?",
        "Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just\n        go.",
        "I promise.",
        "Joey, you can’t keep this to yourself, if you know about this,\n        you have to tell him.",
        "Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?",
        "(holding Ben) Look Benny, spoon. (moves it back and\n        forth) Spoon. Come on! All right, y'know what I think he’s bored.",
        "Okay. Okay honey, he’s fine, he’s fine, let’s just put him\n        down. Come here, Ben. (sets him on the couch) See that’s a good\n        boy. (to Monica) How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me,\n        what is he going to say?!",
        "We’re not?!",
        "All right, I like that. ",
        "So we’re okay, we’re okay, we’re okay, (starts to exam\n        Ben) aren’t we? No, we’re not okay, we’re not okay, there’s a\n        bump, there’s a bump.",
        "I cannot push it in!",
        "Okay, okay, okay.",
        "Okay.",
        "Or. We could put a hat on his head.",
        "We need a hat..",
        "Oh, oh, oh, I’ll get ‘Rainy Day Bear’!! (runs to get him)",
        "Oh God, oh God, it’s sowed on though.",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh!!",
        "Oh, it’s just like a bloodbath in here today.",
        "Right.",
        "See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn’t I?",
        "Okay, I heard that.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "(goes over and hits her head on the post) Look at that!\n        (repeats) Look at that! (repeats) We all do it. (repeats) Okay,\n        I’m stopping now.",
        "Oh yeah! Y'know, if it’s not a headboard, it’s just not worth\n        it.",
        "Monica, number one, I don’t think Ben understands the\n        concept of bribery, and number two, I... (Joey starts laughing\n        in the background) (to Joey) What?!",
        "I also said number one.",
        "Hi!",
        "He’s perfect, he’s never been better.",
        "Well maybe he’s just taking a nap.",
        "Well, we have gotta find out if he’s alive.",
        "Are you, are you, are you sure it’s ah, a new bump? I mean,\n        no offense, I’ve always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed\n        child.",
        "(confidently) I did!",
        "I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his\n        head against that thing!",
        "I hope it’s still funny when you’re in hell.",
        "I’ll get the hat.",
        "Hey-hey, now he’s showing us his poking device.",
        "Wow.",
        "Noo, that’s our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.",
        "Good luck.",
        "(jumping up from reading her magazine) Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.",
        "I know!",
        "Op.",
        "Oh, you got me.",
        "Oh, that sounds great.",
        "Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.",
        "Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.",
        "Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it’s remotely related to the field they’re interested in.",
        "Oh honey, come on, I’m sorry, I didn’t.... I don’t mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.",
        "(to him) Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?",
        "It’s not funny, this is actually my job.",
        "Oh well then, so I’m just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.",
        "Yes?!",
        "(looks at Monica) (to him) Do you want my pickle?",
        "(entering, to Ross) The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.",
        "Hi! So I’m out having lunch at Monica’s and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale’s and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he’s gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!",
        "I know!",
        "Uh-huh!",
        "Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.",
        "What!?",
        "To be nice.",
        "I didn’t have to, because I was wearing my ‘I heart Ross’ sandwich board and ringing my bell.",
        "Well, I assume I’ll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that’s true of any job.",
        "I mean that’s unbelievable.",
        "Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.",
        "That’s all right.",
        "Hey. (they all walk away from Chandler)",
        "Did he call? Did Mark call?",
        "Oh. (we hear laughing from the upstairs apartment) Oh my God, is that Phoebe?",
        "Music. Very nice.",
        "So, how are you?",
        "Oh yeah, what’s it about?",
        "Yeah, I do. (they both run out)",
        "I can’t believe Mark didn’t call. It’s Sunday night, and he didn’t call.",
        "(to Ross) Yeah, right. Look at you, you’re practically giddy.",
        "Yeah, and you don’t mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.",
        "(on phone) Hello, Mark? Hi, it’s Rachel Green. (listens) Oh no, don’t you apologize. (listens) Yeah, I’ll hold. (to Monica and Ross) He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.",
        "(on phone) Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it’s perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! (hangs up phone) I got the interview!",
        "He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.",
        "I got to figure out what I’m going to wear.",
        "Yeah! Right! Okay, I’ll see you guys later. (starts to leave) Woo hoo!",
        "(getting of the elevator and noticing Ross) Hey!",
        "What are you doing here?",
        "Oh.",
        "Hi.",
        "Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn’t shut up.",
        "Me too!",
        "I know.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah. (turns around) Hi Mark!",
        "Oh, I did!",
        "(to Ross) Oh my God!! (she turns around and hugs Mark, not Ross)",
        "Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.",
        "Honey, I’m sorry.",
        "What?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?",
        "(to Chandler) Eh, do you believe that?",
        "I’m gonna get back to retraining. (gets up)",
        "Gunther, Gunther, please, I’ve worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there. (points to the counter.)",
        "Huh. Well, y'know that’s actually a really good idea, because that way they’ll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.",
        "Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I’m, I’m sorry. (walks away)",
        "(sitting down next to Chandler) I’m training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.",
        "Well, yeah! I’m still pursuing that.",
        "Well, I’m also sending out.... good thoughts.",
        "The fear?",
        "Well then how come you’re still at a job that you hate, I mean why don’t you quit and get ‘the fear’?",
        "I don’t know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don’t want to be 30 and still work here.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Can’t I just look at the handles on them?",
        "Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I’m a terrible waitress? Because, I don’t care. I don’t care. I don’t care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don’t care where the tray spot is, I just don’t care, this is not what I want to do. So I don’t think I should do it anymore. I’m gonna give you my weeks notice.",
        "Gunther, I quit.",
        "(entering) Okay, stop what you’re doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....",
        "Hey-hey-hey that’s funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!",
        "I don’t know, I don’t know, weren’t you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!",
        "No, it’s not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don’t have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I’m just gonna, I’m just gonna call Gunther and I’m gonna tell him, I’m not quitting.",
        "You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....",
        "No.",
        "Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Oh, I blew it. I wouldn’t of even hired me.",
        "I can’t! It’s too late! Terry already hired that girl over there. (points to her) Look at her, she’s even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... (starts to cry) swans.",
        "(answering the phone) Hello? (listens) Yeah, this is she. (listens) Oh! You’re kidding! You’re kidding! (listens) Oh thank you! I love you!",
        "(hanging up the phone) I got the job!",
        "Here we go. I’m serving my last cup of coffee. (the gang starts humming the graduation theme) There you go. (hands it to Chandler) Enjoy. (they all cheer)",
        "Um, excuse me, everyone. Ah, this is my last night working here, and I ah, just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here, and ah, it’s just time to move on. (at the counter Gunther starts to cry and runs into the back room) Ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it feels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again.",
        "(running in from her bedroom, wearing only a towel) Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?",
        "(to Ross) Tell him.",
        "(running into the living room) Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.",
        "No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.",
        "Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.",
        "Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. (to Phoebe) Is this actually a lunchbox?",
        "Oh.",
        "Yeah. What kind of discount do we get?",
        "Oh!! I love this job! (her phone rings) Wow! My first call.",
        "Hi honey!",
        "Oh, he's just goofing around.",
        "Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants.",
        "Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?",
        "I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go. (to Mark) Mark, I need you!",
        "Ow! Ross!!",
        "Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm... (she picks up this bug and it starts to play the theme from Love Story)",
        "Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's just really romantic.",
        "Yes.",
        "All right Ross!! I get it!!",
        "You're hurt!",
        "Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!",
        "Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do.",
        "Ohhh! That is soo sweet! (gets up to get herself a cup of coffee)",
        "(now standing behind Ross) Ross!",
        "So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?",
        "Right.",
        "Hello.",
        "A big idiot.",
        "Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?",
        "Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous. (she kisses him)",
        "Where ya going?",
        "Ohh, with who?",
        "There was a woman at the... (realizes) The stripper?!",
        "You have a play date with a stripper?!",
        "Sure, is she married?",
        "Oh. (starts shaking the sugar down in a packet really hard.)",
        "Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?",
        "I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I...",
        "Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.",
        "(to Chandler) Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.",
        "No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.",
        "Oh! That would be sooo much fun!",
        "Let’s do it! Ross?",
        "Do you wanna play football?",
        "Um, there was a Geller Cup?",
        "Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.",
        "(knocking it down instead of catching it) That almost hit me in the face.",
        "Monica, I’m your best friend.",
        "Ross!",
        "You don’t pick me! You’re stuck with me!",
        "(coming over to Ross, who is just getting up) Are you okay?",
        "Over here!",
        "(proud of her self) I almost caught that one!",
        "Wait, what am I gonna do?",
        "Wait, how long?",
        "Okay.",
        "Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it’s like all I’m doing is running back and forth from the huddle.",
        "Can I see that for second.",
        "Now, does it really matter?",
        "All right, so are we not having dinner at all?",
        "I went really long.",
        "I can not believe your trading me!!",
        "Are you gonna let me play?",
        "Yeah!!! Kill ‘um!!!",
        "No! Come on! Don’t make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.",
        "God, I’m not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.",
        "Thank you! Break!",
        "I’m so sorry! Are you okay?",
        "I’m sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn’t know what to do.",
        "(on the verge of tears) Okay.",
        "(in triumph) I got a touchdown! We did it!!",
        "We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there’s a like league we could join or something.",
        "Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.",
        "(looking at her watch) Oh my God, I gotta go to work!",
        "Oh I don’t know honey. It’s gonna be really late.",
        "I know. I’m sorry. Look, I’ll make a deal with you all right? Okay?",
        "For every night that you’re asleep before I get home from work...",
        "I will wake you up in a way that’s proved very popular in the past.",
        "Right.",
        "Somebody got in late last night.",
        "When did this happen?",
        "Monica, what are you doing?",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "Do you have any ice?",
        "Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?",
        "Hmm. (she opens the freezer) Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?",
        "But ah, you’re safe from it if it’s in the freezer?",
        "How often do you read it?",
        "Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that’s a classic, what’s so great about The Shining?",
        "Okay. Ah, well we’ll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, (she tries to take the book away from him but he doesn’t want to let it go) and you will read Little Women.",
        "All right.",
        "Okay.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, Danny just went into room 217.",
        "Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you’re gonna ruin it!",
        "Joey! I can’t believe you just did that!",
        "All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she’s still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.",
        "Eh. Beth dies.",
        "Um-hmm.",
        "What?!",
        "No. She doesn’t die.",
        "Because, I wanted to hurt you.",
        "(gasps) Oh my....",
        "(screams and grabs a potato masher to defend herself) Sorry. I’m sorry.",
        "I’m sorry, I was just thinking you’re day could still pick up.",
        "What?",
        "Awwww.",
        "Joey?",
        "Do you want to put the book in the freezer?",
        "Okay.",
        "You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you’ve got a girlfriend?",
        "(shocked) Oh my God.",
        "Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.",
        "No. A break from us.",
        "Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don’t want to take a break.",
        "Nobody.",
        "Umm, honey, look he just came over to....",
        "Hey.",
        "Well, we never actually got to dinner.",
        "No, we kinda broke up instead.",
        "(looking up at the ceiling) God, Monica it’s on the ceiling.",
        "Yeah, but it’s okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.",
        "No.",
        "No, no-no, it’s okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work.",
        "(on answering machine) Hi, it’s me. I’ve been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.",
        "Eh, I’m just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I don’t want to get back together over a machine.",
        "So, I love you.",
        "And y'know what, I’m gonna, I’m gonna go to bed now, but ah, on my way to work tomorrow morning, I’m gonna stop by around 8:30.",
        "Bye.",
        "Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.",
        "So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?",
        "I can’t talk to you. I can’t even look at you right now!",
        "Just get away from me!",
        "A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!",
        "Ross, you had s*x with another woman!",
        "(opening the door) Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!",
        "Just get out! Now!!",
        "Okay! All right! How was she?",
        "Was she good?",
        "Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let’s talk about it!! How was she?",
        "Good different?",
        "Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? (Ross can’t answer that) Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!",
        "And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!",
        "We were on a break!",
        "You think you’re gonna get out of this on a technicality?",
        "Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!",
        "God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!",
        "Oh, that is so sweet. I think I’m falling in love with you all over again.",
        "All right. Let’s say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?",
        "You’d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?",
        "You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....",
        "I’m thinking, I’m gonna order a pizza.",
        "Fine. (on phone) Hi! Yes, I’d like to order a large pizza.",
        "With ah, extra anchovies.",
        "Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?",
        "Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.",
        "That’s....",
        "That is neither here nor there.",
        "No Ross!! (stands up and moves away from him) Don’t! You can’t just kiss me and think you’re gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn’t work that way. It doesn’t just make it better. Okay?",
        "(softly) I think you should go.",
        "(softly) I really think you need to go now.",
        "Yeah, what the hell did I know!",
        "(crying) No. I can’t, you’re a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can’t stop picturing with her, I can’t, (Ross stands up and backs away) it doesn’t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It’s just changed, everything. Forever.",
        "Then how come it is?",
        "(answering her phone at work) Hello.",
        "Oh, hi.",
        "Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I’ve got to get this order in. Honey, I’m so sorry, but it looks like I’m gonna be here all night.",
        "No-no-no, no, honey please, I’ve got, I’ve just have so much to deal with.",
        "(on the phone) No, no, no, I’m looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And.... (listens) What does it matter, what I’m wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor? (listens) Thank you. (to Sophie) We’re holding.",
        "(startled) Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?",
        "Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.",
        "Honey, honey, I’m sorry, I know it’s our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don’t have time to stop.",
        "But I don’t, hmm... (on phone) Oh, who approved that order?! (listens) Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office. (to Sophie) Get me Mark on the phone!",
        "Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is not the number for (Ross starts making a lot of noise with a handheld pepper grinder) this store, 038 is Atlanta. And I...(stops and looks at Ross)",
        "(angrily) None for me.",
        "I’m sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I’m sorry but that’s... (notices a fire that Ross’s candle has started) Oh my God!!",
        "(on phone) Excuse me, I’m sorry, I’m gonna have to call you back, I’ve got a Schemp in my office. (hangs up) (to Ross) What are you doing?",
        "Ross you’re not listening to me, I don’t have time to stop.",
        "I don’t have ten minutes!!",
        "Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don’t!",
        "Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I’ve got a deadline, would you just go home, I’ll talk to you later. (storms out)",
        "Good bye!",
        "Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...",
        "(throws her stuff down) I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.",
        "You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody’s work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!",
        "But I told you, I didn’t have the time!",
        "Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?",
        "Just a job!",
        "Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I’m doing something that I’m actually good at. I mean. if you don’t get that...",
        "Well neither do I!",
        "(shocked) Oh my God.",
        "Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you’re, you’re, you’re making this too hard.",
        "I don’t know, I don’t know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.",
        "No. (Ross is standing in the doorway.) A break from us.",
        "(jumping up to answer the phone) Hello!",
        "(disappointed) Oh.",
        "No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!",
        "Yeah. Well, umm.....",
        "(on the verge of tears) Yeah, I’m fine.",
        "No! Really, no, please, please, that’s, that’s okay.",
        "Oh, yeah, I’m not, I’m not hungry.",
        "Oh. Okay, bye.",
        "Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don’t want to take a break.",
        "No. (grabs an eggroll) And then I called him, and he wasn’t there.",
        "Oh, thank you that’s very helpful, I’m glad you came over.",
        "Hello.",
        "Hi! Oh, I’m so glad you called.",
        "Nobody.",
        "Umm, honey, look he just came over to....",
        "(picks up the phone and calls Ross) Oh, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, you’re not home.",
        "Hi, sweetie!",
        "I’ve got some bad news.",
        "I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.",
        "Nooo, he’s leaving for a better job.",
        "Well we’re gonna miss you around here.",
        "Yeah, you bet.",
        "Funny book?",
        "Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn’t mind.",
        "Oh, please tell me it’s not because I’m going with Mark.",
        "Oh my God!!! Ross!!",
        "Because, he’s my friend.",
        "Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?",
        "I don’t know, you thought ‘See you Saturday’ was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.",
        "Really!?",
        "Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. (Ross has a worried look on his face) What?",
        "Oh. (puts her hand over his mouth)",
        "Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father’s boat didn’t make that much noise when it hit rocks!",
        "Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he’s ‘Hey everybody! Remember that thing that’s been dead for a gazillion years. Well there’s this little bone we didn’t know it had!’",
        "Okay, see now, what I just heard: blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.",
        "Oh, that is so...",
        "Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn’t go with Mark?",
        "It’s not dumb. But, maybe it’s okay that you’re not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? (Ross looks confused) I mean it’s like, I-I-I like that you’re not involved in that part of my life.",
        "Honey see, it doesn’t mean that I don’t love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it’s-it’s for me y'know, I’m out there, on my own, and I’m doing it and it’s scary but I love it, because it’s mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?",
        "What?!!",
        "Hey!",
        "Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.",
        "Closer than here?",
        "Wait, I’m not just gonna drink somebody’s old coffee.",
        "(softly) Is he here?",
        "Oh. (smiles) Here’s your moisturiser. Hi!",
        "You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. (they’re all silent and look away) Okay, I said that out loud right?",
        "Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.",
        "Hm-mm.",
        "Ohh!",
        "Oh, it’s okay. (starts to leave)",
        "And heels.",
        "No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that’s only fair. (leaves)",
        "Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I’m asking you first, right?!. I mean I’m playing by the rules.",
        "Chandler! You’re smoking? What are you doing?!",
        "Okay.",
        "No. Thank you.",
        "Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is ‘no tissue, no tuschy.’ (Phoebe laughs and gets out.) Well, if everybody’s going. (She gets out and starts to close the door.)",
        "What?!",
        "What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra.",
        "No, I stuff outside the bra.",
        "(seeing him) Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.",
        "What, what’s it, what’s going on?",
        "So you know how to fix it?",
        "Great!",
        "Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.",
        "I don’t know, I’m sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.",
        "Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.",
        "No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!",
        "No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you’ll have to think of something else.",
        "(all excited) Op, op, car! Car!! (sees it’s Ross) Ugh!!!",
        "What is he doing here?!",
        "All right!! Fine! Fine.",
        "Ask me what?",
        "You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.",
        "Why would you even want to come Ross? You’re a horrible skier.",
        "All right, let’s go!",
        "Oh, I’m sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?",
        "Y'know Ross why don’t you put that on your answering machine!",
        "(to Monica) What?!",
        "Really Joey?",
        "No, I think it’s very obvious who’s wrong here.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Well, I’m really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit. (hands him an audio cassette)",
        "Come on, it’s a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn’t smoked since.",
        "(to Ross) What’s your problem?",
        "Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.",
        "Oh right, ‘cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.",
        "Oh, y'know what, I didn’t want cinnamon on this.",
        "Oh my God!! Great!",
        "Well, that shouldn’t be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.",
        "(laughs) Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain’t a pretty picture in the morning, y’know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.",
        "I think you should definitely go out with this guy.",
        "Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker: Texas Ranger?",
        "All right.",
        "Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Thank you.",
        "Hey Mon, let’s give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.",
        "We use it!!",
        "Oh my God, Monica’s gonna go out with a millionaire.",
        "Oh my God, I can’t believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.",
        "Oh yeah, sure, that too.",
        "Oh my God! The millionaire’s here!",
        "Hi!!",
        "Just one drink?!",
        "Thank you.",
        "Hi! All right, let’s go shoppin’!!",
        "Oh, okay.",
        "Wow! Umm....",
        "I know.",
        "Well, I told him I would think about it, but I’m gonna tell him no.",
        "I mean I think I’d say no to anybody right now. (Hearing this Gunther swoops back to cleaning tables.) Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I’m standing there with this charming, cute guy, who’s asking me to go out with him, which I’m allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I’d be cheating on Ross or something.",
        "I don’t have any issues with my Father.",
        "Hi!",
        "Yeah. Ahh, here’s a box of your stuff. (hands him a box)",
        "Oh, y'know, it’s just like hats, and a shirt, and CD’s, just sort of stuff that you’ve left here.",
        "No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it’s time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don’t’ you think?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Good.",
        "Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.",
        "Okay, all right, give me the mug! I’ll keep the mug.",
        "You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!",
        "Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....",
        "Petty... (goes into her room)",
        "Petty...",
        "Small...",
        "You are so just doing this out of spite.",
        "Huh?",
        "You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn’t even fit you anymore!",
        "(imitating him) yeah-yeah-yeah!!",
        "Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, ‘Where’s number 27?!’",
        "Y'know what?",
        "I can’t do this.",
        "Well, oh, Mark, I’m doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I’m just doing it to get back at Ross. I’m sorry, it’s not very fair to you.",
        "Oh God. I’m sorry about this.",
        "You sure?",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn’t a chair.",
        "Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I’m just gonna throw it out, it’s probably just a bunch of shampoo and... (she opens the box and stops)",
        "(She takes the T-shirt out of the box and holds it to her chest and take a deep breath.) No. Nothing. (She smiles and goes into her room.)",
        "Hey, Sophie!",
        "Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn’t have to walk me all the way back up here.",
        "Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don’t keep the women’s lingerie here in the office?",
        "Summer catalogue! (hands him the catalogue)",
        "(introduces them) Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing (to Chandler) Joanna.",
        "Bye, Chandler.",
        "Oh, nothing, he’s just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore.",
        "No!! No! He’s not married, or involved, with anyone!",
        "Well, I’ll ask him for you, if you want me too?",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "I need to talk to you!",
        "Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.",
        "Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...",
        "(looks at him) That was (pause) surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?",
        "Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she’s gonna love me.",
        "Wow!!",
        "What’s this?",
        "All right!",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Ooohhhh!!",
        "Ahhhh!!",
        "(to Chandler) O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.",
        "Hmm.",
        "What?!",
        "Oh, I....",
        "Oh, I know...",
        "Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you’re going to call her?",
        "You can’t just say, ‘Nice to meet you, good night?’",
        "Well, they always called.",
        "No. Sorry.",
        "Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.",
        "Well...",
        "No. I...",
        "(grabbing the magazine out of his hands) Call her! Call her now!",
        "Why hasn’t he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don’t understand. Why? He said he’ll call. Why? Why? Chandler I’m telling you she has flipped out, she’s gone crazy!",
        "Come on, this isn’t funny. She thinks it’s my fault that you haven’t called her. You have to call her!",
        "Well then you’re going to have to take her out again.",
        "I don’t care! I don’t care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it’s actually ended. And, I don’t care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!",
        "That’s fine!",
        "I know.",
        "Sophie’s desk.",
        "(whispering) Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!",
        "Chandler!!",
        "Okay, you are going to tell her and you’re going to tell her now. (She grabs his nipple and starts to twist it.)",
        "Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold? I was supposed to call my Dad back like two hours ago.",
        "What’s Flimby’s?",
        "Okay. Hang up! That’s it! Come on!",
        "I had one.",
        "No. No, not at all, not at all. I actually was gonna bring someone myself, so…",
        "I meant, me plus one!",
        "Okay, bye-bye!",
        "Okay, I need a date! (runs to her bedroom)",
        "Oh, hi!",
        "How are you? (She goes to kiss him on the cheek, but stops because of the dates and pats him on the shoulder.)",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah, looks that way. First ones here! Wooo!!",
        "Oh! Tommy, this is Ross. Ross, Tommy.",
        "Okay, uhh, I think I’m going to run to the ladies room.",
        "Oh, hi!",
        "Hey. Gosh, you look soo familiar.",
        "We’re not actors.",
        "Hey!",
        "What time is it?",
        "Tommy’s supposed to be here soon, we’re going to lunch.",
        "You don’t?!",
        "Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.",
        "(not seeing Ross) What’s your favourite thing about summertime?",
        "Yeah…",
        "Tommyyyy! Say, what’s your favourite thing about summer?",
        "Ross, would you just stop it! It’s getting really old.",
        "Phoe-be!!",
        "Oh, you’re welcome a million.",
        "(softly) Oh my God.",
        "Whoa! What?! Why?!",
        "Here?! Now?!",
        "Well, can’t you tell her that you are not in the mood?",
        "(interrupting) Whoa-ho.",
        "I don’t know.",
        "Oh, making it worse!",
        "Oh, was it awful?",
        "I wrote you a letter.",
        "(handing him the letter) It’s just some things I’ve been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.",
        "Well, I’ll be waiting for you, just come up when you’re done.",
        "(coming down the stairs) Hey! (Ross jumps up, and quickly puts the letter back together, pretending like he has just finished it.) What happened to you? Why didn’t you come up?",
        "You just finished?",
        "So umm, does it?",
        "Does it?",
        "What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn’t, and if you have to even think about it...",
        "Are you sure?",
        "I know. (Hugs him more violently this time and pushes him back away from the letter.)",
        "How was the beach?",
        "Ooh, I have to go pack. (Gets up to do so.) It really does?",
        "All right, that’s it, you guys! What happened out there?",
        "Come on!",
        "Ewwww!!",
        "(turning to look at Joey) Ewwww!!",
        "Oh-hooo, I missed you.",
        "Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you’ve grown. Y'know?",
        "You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, “Once a cheater, always a cheater.”",
        "Ooh, I just wish we hadn’t lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...",
        "Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!",
        "What?!!",
        "You fell asleep?!",
        "Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!",
        "Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you’re at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!",
        "(to Monica) Sorry!! (to Ross) I just feel bad about all that sleep you’re gonna miss wishing you were with me!",
        "And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!",
        "How’d it go with Pete?!",
        "So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?",
        "Why?! What is it?",
        "Yes!!",
        "Y'know I don’t, I don’t understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin’ her boob.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, ah with who?",
        "Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?",
        "Oh! (laughs) That’s fine.",
        "(to Phoebe) Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?",
        "This is Bonnie? (to Phoebe) This is Bonnie? (to Bonnie) You’re Bonnie?",
        "Oh no, I’m sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.",
        "Oh, that must be it.",
        "(to Phoebe) You said she was bald.",
        "How could you not tell me that she has hair?",
        "(looks in the window) Ohh, well, this is just perfect!",
        "Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!",
        "Why, does she have a bad personality?",
        "(seeing Ross and Bonnie inside Central Perk) Oh my God! Phoebe look, it’s Ross and that girl.",
        "Phoebe! (goes back to the window)",
        "Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that’s, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that’s what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...",
        "Ohh! (walking away from the window) Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he’s gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.",
        "You said she was bald!!",
        "Phoebe, we can’t, we just can’t just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!",
        "(quietly) Yes.",
        "Yes.",
        "I just y'know, I didn’t expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh! (sits down on the curb)",
        "What?",
        "Oh!",
        "Oh, I can’t watch this. (turns her eyes away)",
        "(entering, interrupting them) Hey guys! What's... (sees what they're doing and stops, the guys are stunned)",
        "Hi!",
        "Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?",
        "Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher.",
        "What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.",
        "Hi!",
        "And?",
        "Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?",
        "So Pheebs, pick one of them.",
        "(entering with Phoebe) This place is amazing.",
        "(standing up) Ahh... Chandler's on the couch!!",
        "Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!",
        "Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, “Look how much money we’ve got!” Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it’ll be dry, but people will like it.",
        "Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!",
        "OH MY GOD!!! (She holds her hands up in triumph and the gang all look at her.) Sorry, I was just imagining what it’d be like to catch the money bouquet.",
        "(entering) Hi! Okay, don’t be mad at me, but I couldn’t resist.",
        "Yes, and I know that you’d say no if he asked you, but I’m sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin. (shows her the picture.)",
        "Oh my God. (starting to cry)",
        "You didn’t break up with that fireman?",
        "Wow!",
        "(to Monica) I mean is that woman capable of talking about\n        anything else but s*x?",
        "That is so cool.",
        "(sarcastic) Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.",
        "(approaching) Hey! ",
        "Ross gave it to me.",
        "Ohh, thank you.",
        "Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell\n        you that hats are back.",
        "Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!",
        "(to Monica) Allll done!",
        "Okay, who’s next?! (She looks around the room, and stops when\n        she comes to Ross.)",
        "Come on, please?! I’m boredddd! You let me do it once before.",
        "Yes! (she starts creeping up on him)",
        "Just once! ",
        "Take it like a man, Ross!",
        "Oh, come on!",
        "Really?!",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "(reading a card) Okay, your band is playing at Arnold’s,\n        collect three cool points. Which means, I have five, and that\n        means I get Joey’s boxers!",
        "(getting up) All right, I’m gonna make more margaritas! (She\n        pours the rest of the pitcher into Ross’s glass.)",
        "I’m just making margaritas.",
        "What?! ",
        "Oh, come on!",
        "Monica, please?",
        "(pause) He is, isn’t he? I don’t know, I don’t know, I mean\n        maybe it’s just being here at the beach together or, I don’t\n        know. But it’s like something... (she’s interrupted by the\n        sound of Bonnie entering)",
        "(entering) Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?!",
        "Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn’t up yet. Did you guys\n        hear them last night?",
        "Oh, great.",
        "I’m going for a walk.",
        "Oh, ah nothin’. I just felt like hangin’ out here and reading.",
        "Ohhhh, sorry I missed that.",
        "Ohh-ha-ha!",
        "Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were\n        bald.",
        "Ohh!",
        "Really?!",
        "I mean you definitely should do that.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!",
        "Aww Pheebs, that sucks!",
        "Hi!",
        "That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge.",
        "Hey!",
        "Come on see, she doesn’t look that bad.",
        "I don’t know.",
        "All right! Ross, do you think it’s easy for me to see you with\n        somebody else?",
        "Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving\n        you!",
        "Noo.",
        "Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!",
        "Noo! Maybe! I, I don’t know. Ross, I still can’t forgive you\n        for what you did, I can’t, I just, but sometimes when I’m with\n        you I just, I feel so...",
        "I just, I feel, I-I just...",
        "I feel...",
        "Well! Good night. (to Ross) I’m going upstairs.",
        "Good! ‘Cause I’ve got a product report to read, it’s like eight pages, I hope I don’t fall asleep.",
        "(sees Chip’s phone number) Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?",
        "(interrupting) I bet he sensed that I was ready to have s*x with another guy.",
        "Okay. (picks up phone) Are you sure you wanna hear this?",
        "(on phone) Chip! Hi, it’s Rachel. (listens) Rachel Green. Yeah, umm, you left me a message. (listens) Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. (listens) Monica Geller. (listens) Ohh.",
        "Why? I love that thing.",
        "Oh no.",
        "Something to do with numbers?",
        "What?",
        "You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!",
        "Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you’re going out with Chip Matthews?",
        "Nooo! It’s not okay! I can’t believe you would want to after what he did to me!",
        "Monica! I couldn’t find him for two hours! He was having s*x with Amy Welch!",
        "I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!",
        "Okay, that doesn’t help me, because we went to the same high school.",
        "(shocked) They had to have that specially made?!",
        "(stunned) Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!",
        "Oh, you go out with him. (goes over and hugs her) ",
        "Yeah. Just, if it’s possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have s*x with another guy?",
        "I believe it.",
        "Yes, I do.",
        "Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.",
        "Jurassic Park could happen.",
        "(entering) You guys, you’re never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! (She’s holding a flyer.) Look kinda familiar?",
        "You guys, there’s a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!",
        "Do we have to tell her?",
        "I hate when Ross is right!",
        "Pheebs...",
        "All right!!",
        "Jeez!",
        "Hello, Chip.",
        "I’m great! I’m great. I’ve got a great job at Bloomingdale’s, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I’m not seeing anyone right now, I’ve never felt better about myself.",
        "She’ll be out in a second. So, Chip, how’s umm, Amy Welch?",
        "Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.",
        "(to Monica) So, how was your date?",
        "Um-hmm.",
        "Oh honey, I’m sorry.",
        "Ohh! That’s so great!",
        "I’m sorry, sweetie. (shows her the flyer)",
        "That’s a good call. Right.",
        "You could.... say you’re sorry to her mom.",
        "So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?",
        "I’ll go with you.",
        "Oh! Good thing Chandler’s not here, he always wins at this game.",
        "(entering) Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?",
        "My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must’ve been awkward.",
        "(laughs) You ah, you didn’t say ‘Yes’ to that did you?",
        "What is she doing here?",
        "I don’t understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a ‘big, dull dud.’",
        "Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!",
        "Chandler!! (He turns around quickly) Promise me, you will end it.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Oh yeah, I totally agree.",
        "That’s weird, she locked the door.",
        "Okay, swear you won’t tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna’s office. Do you wanna see the list?",
        "(answering it) (angrily) What?!",
        "You promised you would break up with her!",
        "And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!",
        "Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.",
        "Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! (Grabs the key) You never see Joanna again!",
        "You never come into this office again!",
        "You give me back my Walkman!",
        "Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!",
        "Does it hurt?",
        "Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?",
        "When she sees that you’re gone, she’s gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I’m gonna get fired!",
        "No, there’s nothing to make up, she’s gonna know that I have a key to her office, I’ve got to get you locked up back the way you were! (She tries to drag him over to the chair, but Chandler stops her.)",
        "Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she’s very private about her office. Now I know why.",
        "What if I clean your bathroom for a month?",
        "Foot rubs for a month!",
        "I’ll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!",
        "Sophie sit!!",
        "No! God, would you just calm down!",
        "I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.",
        "I ah… Oh! I’ll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!",
        "(happily) Yeah!!",
        "D’oh!! (pause) I’ve got it!",
        "I have so got it. There’s gonna be rumours about this, there’s no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.",
        "Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous (Holds her hands far apart) or very (In a high pitched voice) stingy.",
        "I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation’s Milton Berle.",
        "Ohh, not compared to you. (Chandler nods in agreement)",
        "So did you break up with Joanna?",
        "What?!",
        "It’s me! Good morning!",
        "Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn’t have poppy seed bagels, so I… (Enters Joanna’s office and sees her handcuffed to her chair wearing nothing but a slip) Oh my word!",
        "Oh, yeah! Yeah!",
        "Okay.",
        "What?",
        "Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.",
        "Well, I thought you liked doing it. (Rachel starts out the door and stops.)",
        "Right!",
        "Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.",
        "Ummm. Oh! I’m sorry. (She grabs the box and offers him a piece.) It’s a little old but…",
        "I’m sorry. I didn’t—I don’t come in here a lot.",
        "No.",
        "I didn’t… I never said that.",
        "(starting to cry) Okay, I’m sorry. (Runs out still carrying the pizza box.)",
        "Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.",
        "That’s easy for you to say, you weren’t almost just killed.",
        "Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?",
        "Oh! My hero! What happened?",
        "What?! You got us evicted!!",
        "That’s not true! (Starts to cry.)",
        "Go!!",
        "Well, why doesn’t he practice with a girl?",
        "Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that…garbage chute. (Starts to cry)",
        "Hey! So, did you quit?",
        "Oh, umm, I was just y’know working out and umm… Oh, that’s it.",
        "Where?!",
        "(laughing) What was that?",
        "You just did a little dancy thing.",
        "You are soo enjoying this.",
        "Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.",
        "What are you ever gonna use that for?!",
        "You got fired?!",
        "Sweety...",
        "Yeah?",
        "May fifth, why?",
        "Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her.",
        "Well, have fun!",
        "Yeah, she's...",
        "You love her.",
        "(entering, with a guy) Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross.",
        "Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.",
        "Okay. (He starts to leave, and Rachel grabs him and gives him a passionate kiss.) I'll miss you.",
        "I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum.",
        "Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?",
        "What was that?",
        "Oh. (She tries to walk away from Josh, by he keeps holding her) Stop it!",
        "Yeah! (Monica gives a sarcastic thumbs up) (Josh leaves) I am soo gonna marry that guy. (looking in her wallet) Ohhh!",
        "I think he's stealing from me.",
        "Because he's stealing from me!",
        "Ughh! (Storms out after him)",
        "Well where's Amanda?",
        "I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.",
        "Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.",
        "(laughing) Ohh, that is soo sad.",
        "Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it! (Shows her, her ring)",
        "Sorry.",
        "Y'know...",
        "Yeah.",
        "No!",
        "(confused) Okay.",
        "(really confused) Okay.",
        "So who’s idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?",
        "What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?",
        "And you’re still not attracted to him at all?",
        "Yeah, but Mon that’s totally different. He was you’re health\n        teacher.",
        "Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me\n        yesterday.",
        "I know. ",
        "Ow!!",
        "(looking at the outfit) Got a job on a river boat?",
        "Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.",
        "Now that you’re on you’re own, you’re free to look as stupid\n        as you like.",
        "Yeah, come here!",
        "Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!",
        "(she reaches for the bottle) Oww! (She grabs the bottle, but\n        has trouble opening it. She pops the top off and aspirins fly\n        all over the place as Ross enters.)",
        "(She bends over to try and pick up the aspirin) Oww!",
        "I’m fine, I’m fine.",
        "Yes I am! ",
        "Look, I’m fine. Watch. (She picks up an aspirin between her\n        toes) Look at that. (She lifts her leg to grab the aspirin\n        with her hand and almost falls over.) Whoa-whoa!",
        "No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses\n        house. It’s a very big deal, there’s a lot of people there I\n        have to meet.",
        "Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it’ll still be\n        broken then.",
        "But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready.",
        "Look, either help me or go.",
        "(with a hurt expression on her face) Okay, but before you go,\n        could you help me first?",
        "(She drops the brush) Y'know what? I cannot do this with my\n        left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?",
        "(taking the brush back) Okay. Let’s use this brush. (Hands him\n        another one.)",
        "Yeah.",
        "Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across\n        the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.",
        "Oh-ho!",
        "Hey! That’s just poking me in the eye!",
        "Okay, just sweep it.",
        "Right.",
        "Okay, now make it even, ‘cause we don’t...",
        "We don’t want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.",
        "Since when, since when do you think I don’t wear enough of\n        this?",
        "Blow it.",
        "Sophisticated like a hooker?",
        "Sure.",
        "Sure, I’ll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing.",
        "Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?",
        "Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.",
        "I don’t want you to see me naked!",
        "Yeah, but that was different. Y’know? I mean, we were, we were\n        going out then, now I think it’s weird.",
        "What?",
        "Ross! Stop that!",
        "Come on! I don’t want you thinking of me like that any more!",
        "Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!",
        "Rosss...",
        "All right. (She starts to take off her robe) Fine.",
        "O-kay!! See what you did, I’m gonna be doing it by myself now.\n        Okay? ",
        "That’s it. (She crawls onto the bed) Ow!!! ",
        "Oh-ow!",
        "Ow!",
        "Ow!",
        "Ow!",
        "Ow! Ow!",
        "Okay, I do. ",
        "I really do.",
        "Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you’re not gonna come with me?",
        "Okay.",
        "Thank you. (She goes to take off her make-up and screams in\n        pain) Oww!!!! God!",
        "I’m sorry, I just can’t go to the hospital lookin’ like this.",
        "Okay, you’d tell me the truth. Right?",
        "Okay.",
        "What thing? What thing?",
        "What thing? What is this thing?",
        "Oh my God! ",
        "Ross, why didn’t you tell me that?",
        "I cannot believe you.",
        "That is the sweetest thing, I just....",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh, I’m sorry I spoiled you’re evening.",
        "Um-hmm, yeah.",
        "(After he closes the door) See ya.",
        "Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?",
        "Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.",
        "Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!",
        "Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?",
        "Oh, honey, that's so sweet.",
        "Oh my God! What happened?",
        "Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.",
        "And not one of your coupons for an hour of \"Joey Love.\"",
        "No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.",
        "Hey, how'd it go?",
        "You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.",
        "And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?",
        "No....",
        "Yes! Rent!",
        "What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.",
        "What did you get her? (Joey opens up a rectangular black box and holds up a pen.)",
        "Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?",
        "Any luck?",
        "All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.",
        "Aw, honey, that's so sweet.",
        "Oh! Pathetic! (Grabs the crossword puzzle and starts writing.)",
        "I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to hug!",
        "Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!",
        "Thanks!",
        "Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go?",
        "Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!",
        "Oh, I can’t believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.",
        "Why not?",
        "Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.",
        "Yeah, Phoebe you’re… awful!",
        "I know, I remember that!",
        "Well, Chandler, you’re gonna have to tell him.",
        "Because you do.",
        "Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.",
        "What?",
        "No?",
        "Oh!",
        "Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There’s an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss…",
        "Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and…",
        "God, I am so glad you don’t have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn’t even consider applying.",
        "(interrupting) And that’s I’m so glad… there’s no problem.",
        "Ohh! That’s great!",
        "Really?!",
        "Well, I, umm…",
        "Thank you.",
        "Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.",
        "Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.",
        "I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.",
        "Yes, I realize that…",
        "I love working with designers!",
        "(entering Joanna’s office) Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.",
        "No! It didn’t! That’s what I want to talk to you about. (starts to break up) Now, just to brief you… (starts to cry) I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.",
        "There’s nobody here!",
        "Do you want me to quit?",
        "Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y’know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, (She goes over to get all of her belongings from the desk, which amount to a muffin and a pen) and I will be gone by the end of the day! (Realizes she has nothing.) Well, I guess there’s no use to me sticking around ‘til the end of the day! (Starts to leave.)",
        "What?",
        "My drinking?",
        "Said what? Exactly.",
        "Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I’m leaving! You are just a horrible person!",
        "Say more things like that.",
        "I’d need an expense account.",
        "And an assistant.",
        "Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?",
        "Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I’m soo happy!",
        "Ohh, you’ve waited soo long.",
        "Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.",
        "How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale’s?",
        "Yes!!!",
        "Ohh, it’s gonna be so great! I’m gonna get to help decide what we sell, I’m gonna have an office with walls and everything. (turns to Monica) I’m gonna have walls!",
        "I’m an assistant buyer!!",
        "Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?",
        "Heard what?",
        "Oh my God! How?!",
        "Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!",
        "Oh, God. Oh, God. (gets worried) Oh God.",
        "Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before… it happened.",
        "Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she’d still be with us—nothing about an assistant buyer?",
        "Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn’t hear about Joanna…",
        "What the hell is that?!! (to Monica) What the hell is that? Is that you? (Monica nods her head no, and Rachel realizes what is making that sound.) Ohhhhhhh! (storms over to Chandler and Joey’s with Monica in trail.)",
        "(angrily) BACK OFF!!! (She starts banging on their door.) Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!",
        "What is that noise?",
        "Well, I’ve been up since six. Thanks to somebody’s dumb-ass rooster.",
        "Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around…",
        "What?",
        "I’m so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.",
        "How many guesses do you get?",
        "No! There’s no orange juice in there! We win!!",
        "Okay, well, we won that one.",
        "Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.",
        "Fine! We’ll ask Phoebe.",
        "I know! I know, it’s such a huge, life-altering thing.",
        "Tails!",
        "We’ll take Literature!!",
        "Chandler gets it! It’s Chandler Bing!",
        "(shouting) It’s All Relative!!",
        "(shouting) I’m sorry!",
        "Monica, I don’t want to lose 200 dollars.",
        "Monica?!",
        "Okay, so let’s play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!",
        "Oooohh that’s interesting.",
        "Throw in the duck too!",
        "Well, he gets the other one all riled up.",
        "Monica, betting the apartment, I don’t know about this.",
        "Why? Do you have the answers written on there?",
        "All right, let’s do it.",
        "Okay. (They go into the living room.)",
        "All right!",
        "14?",
        "Space cowboy!",
        "Oh gosh, it has something to do with numbers.",
        "He carries a briefcase.",
        "Oh-oh-oh, he’s a transponce—transpondster!",
        "Oh my God.",
        "(entering from Chandler’s bedroom, I guess, and sees the foosball table.) Oh my God! I can’t believe you guys are actually think you’re moving in here!",
        "Well I-I-I’m not moving.",
        "No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!",
        "Noooo.",
        "What?!",
        "I don’t care, I’m not going anywhere.",
        "No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment and I like it! This is a girl’s apartment! That is a boy’s apartment, it’s dirty and it smells. This is pretty. It’s-it’s so pretty! And look, and it’s-it’s purple! And I’m telling you, you with the steady hand, I am not moving, and now I have got the steady hand. (She holds out her hand, which is shaking uncontrollably.)",
        "That’s right! You do what the hand says!",
        "How did it go?",
        "Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!",
        "That is not true. She did! She forced me!",
        "Well it stupid, unfair question!",
        "Will you stop calling it your apartment!",
        "No it’s not!",
        "Oh, I think I saw some in here.",
        "I don’t know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it’ll die.",
        "Well you said *black*. Why would he want his blue blazer black?",
        "Don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?",
        "[nodding appreciatively] Nice, all right, yeah!",
        "Honey, this is really an incredible thing to do for them but there are things to think about.",
        "Wow, I don't know if I could ever do that. You know, I always figured the first time I had a baby, it would be with someone I love and that baby would be like, a keeper.",
        "Why don't you talk to someone who's had a baby. Like your mom.",
        "I am so jealous. You guys are just, really, right *there*, aren't you?",
        "Chandler, that is so nice.",
        "Why, just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, you should.",
        "Yeah, when we're in the audience, he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave.",
        "Yeah, not for girls anyway. Guys agree [snaps her fingers] like that.",
        "Let me see that. [looks at the drawing] Oh yeah.",
        "Well, you know, sometimes that helps.",
        "Well, if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Matterhorn.",
        "Oh, TOES!! [raises hands in air. They both look at her.] Yeah, for some people.",
        "[sadly] Oh.",
        "[looking away] Oh, I can't watch this. It's like \"Sophie's Choice.\"",
        "Oh, it was only okay.",
        "Depends who asked.",
        "Oh, Mon. Sure.",
        "Yes.",
        "You're not asking me, are you?",
        "Yes, totally.",
        "Hey, y’know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it’ll be Valentine’s Day, then my birthday, then bang!—before you know it, they’re lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! (hearing this, Gunther moves in) Y’know, I want a man!! (Gunther leaves depressed) I mean, it doesn’t even have to be a big relationship, y’know, just like a fling would be great.",
        "Well, believe me, it’s been a long time since I’ve been flung.",
        "Yeah! Wait a minute, it’s been a long time that I’ve been single. How come you never offered this before?",
        "Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don’t like guys with boring jobs.",
        "Hey, honey! What’s the matter? (Monica shows her, her hat.) Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!",
        "Well, wait a minute, you’re the boss! Why don’t you just yell at them? Or, fire them?",
        "Pheebs, that’s great!",
        "But y’know umm, Rachel doesn’t rhyme with draddle.",
        "Oh yeah!",
        "Really?!",
        "So, will I like any of these guys?",
        "Chandler!",
        "Ohh, I like swimmer’s bodies!",
        "Op, I like credit cards!",
        "Well, so what does he do?",
        "Your company has a fine foods division?",
        "(entering) Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!",
        "Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.",
        "Well, y'know, possibly. (pause) You didn’t tell him that, though? Right?",
        "You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don’t tell the guy that!",
        "Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date—oh, he’s so gonna get the wrong idea.",
        "Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?",
        "You idiot!!",
        "You don’t tell a guy that you’re looking for a serious relationship! You don’t tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!",
        "Y’know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!",
        "Oh! See just I’m right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks! (She sits down heavily in one of the new chairs)",
        "Really?",
        "No.",
        "Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.",
        "Well that sounds fun too. (They hug.)",
        "What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!",
        "Bloomingdale’s eliminated my department. (Phoebe gasps)",
        "No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "(on the phone) Monica, I’m quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn’t even buy it! (Pause) I’m telling you I’m quitting! That’s it! I’m talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes I am! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. (Hangs up as her boss, Mr. Waltham, walks in.) Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you.",
        "Hi!",
        "Hi, I’m Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?",
        "Oh, I’m so sorry.",
        "Well, at least that’s a great suit.",
        "Okay.",
        "No-no, that wasn’t me! (To Joshua) Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. (Joshua turns at that) The selection of underwear we carry.",
        "Oh-oh, sorry, it’s this way, it’s this way. (Motions to the correct way.)",
        "I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!",
        "Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.",
        "Hi-e!!",
        "Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.",
        "It’s Joshua.",
        "Why? Honey, what is the big deal?",
        "Yeah, that’s true.",
        "Chandler, what did she say?",
        "Beefsteak Charlie’s?",
        "Whoops. (Starts to go into Chandler and Joey’s.) Oh, hey, do you need help with that?",
        "Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum. (She goes into Chandler and Joey’s.)",
        "Hi!",
        "So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It’s just so frustrating!",
        "Really? It doesn’t seem desperate?",
        "Hmm-mmm.",
        "Yeah but, I’ve never asked a guy out before.",
        "No. Have you?",
        "I don’t even know how I would go about it.",
        "You know what, I’m gonna do that, I’m gonna call him up, and I’m gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. (Practising) How you doin’? (Calls him) Hi! Joshua? It’s Rachel Green from Bloomingdale’s. (Listens) Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and we—(Listens) the license? Well, that is a good idea! Uh, well, let’s see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I’ll see you tomorrow. Bye. (Hangs up) (to Phoebe) You’ve done that a thousand times?",
        "Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.",
        "Really?! You think that will work?",
        "Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? (Tries again.) You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too… (Tries again.) Umm, who likes the Knicks—(Joshua comes in from the dressing room.)",
        "Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!",
        "Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. (She puts her arm in his and checks how they would look as a couple.) Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. (Pause) Umm, so you like it?",
        "Great.",
        "Sure.",
        "Yeah-eah-ha!",
        "Oh well, you don’t want to do that now?!",
        "Okay.",
        "Basketball!",
        "I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you’re interested, just as a thank you for this week.",
        "Really?",
        "I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.",
        "He didn’t turn me down! He’s at the game isn’t he? I got the date, I’m just not on it!",
        "Wow! Monica!",
        "Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.",
        "Really?",
        "Yes! I will! Absolutely! (She takes out his license and her license and holds them face to face with each other. She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in Spaceballs, and mimic a conversation between the two of them.) Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I’m glad. Rachel, I’d like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin’?",
        "So are things with you and Joey any better?",
        "Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?",
        "You shouldn’t.",
        "Well, I’m gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.",
        "I know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, I just… (goes into her bedroom.)",
        "(standing in her doorway) People are trying to sleep in here!",
        "Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.",
        "Ooh, so cute, that I’m thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.",
        "I know, it’s sick.",
        "Because it’s Richard’s son! It’s like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!",
        "Is he okay in there?",
        "So now, what exactly is the point of the box?",
        "(worried) Why?",
        "Okay. (She goes into her bedroom)",
        "(coming out of her bedroom with a necklace) Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.",
        "Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.",
        "Well isn’t it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?",
        "Credit.",
        "Ooh, I like those sunglasses.",
        "(Swears in Italian, it’s the same term used by Joey earlier and Joey nods his approval.)",
        "Fancy soap? I thought we were savin’ that for the Pope!",
        "(pouring the wine) Sick-sick-sick-sick.",
        "Ross, can you pass me the yams?",
        "Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!",
        "Okay, fine. (She gets up and walks into her bedroom)",
        "Don’t say that I have no sentiment! (Starts to show Ross what’s in the box.) This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! (Holds up a bone) This is from the museum from the first time we… were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!",
        "Joey, had reasons.",
        "What?!",
        "Oh, he sees her!",
        "Chandler, there’s a guy right over there. (Points to the counter)",
        "Chandler, don’t worry! This doesn’t make you less of a guy! (Chandler starts blowing on his fingernails like women do.) That does! (Chandler stops blowing.) What am I sitting on? (She looks and finds a huge nail.) I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Well, here’s another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?",
        "Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?",
        "Guess who we ran into today?!",
        "You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.",
        "(entering, with Joey) Hey!",
        "Y’know, you-you also could’ve used uh, lamps and then followed the light.",
        "It’s coming from Joey!",
        "Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.",
        "(starts laughing, Ross stares at her) I’m sorry. I’m sorry. You’re right, you are a tough guy. You’re the toughest palaeontologist I know.",
        "Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin’ at him.",
        "You…are…not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?",
        "No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.",
        "(refers to the table) What are these?",
        "Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?",
        "Wow! If only more people knew.",
        "Hey!",
        "(noticing a bunch of pictures around the door that weren’t there originally.) What-what are-what are these?",
        "Oh my God! Look at this!",
        "I don’t care! The wires have come loose in your head!",
        "And did you?!",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.",
        "Thank God.",
        "Well, Joshua’s coming in tomorrow and since I don’t have the guts to ask him out, I’m going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.",
        "Oh, here’s that trench-coat that you wanted.",
        "Yeah?",
        "(stopping him) Oh no-no, no-no, they don’t want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.",
        "Well, that’s because of a lot of…(She imitates someone picking their nose and placing the treasure found in the pockets.)",
        "I know!",
        "Oh?",
        "Well, congratulations, so do you love her?",
        "Huh. Well, uh, that’s uh, that’s interesting. (She goes over and retrieves her note.)",
        "Oh, it’s just an anti-theft device.",
        "You need that, you need that too ‘cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up. (Rips up the note.)",
        "Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.",
        "We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it’s actually for Joshua. (Starts handing out party hats.) Look, he said he’s not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him! (Hands Ross a party hat.)",
        "Surprise!!!",
        "Well, it was all Ross’s idea.",
        "Uhh, because I’m trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he’s looking over here, say something funny.",
        "Okay, y’know what, y’know what? This playing hard to get thing is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. (Chandler does so.) Okay. Okay. (She does a little sexy walk over to where Joshua is standing.) Hi!",
        "Care for a cherry?",
        "No? Y’know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.",
        "Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?",
        "Up!",
        "Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.",
        "Ohh, God! Look at him, he’s so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?",
        "What?",
        "It’s not Christmas!",
        "He’s not 11!",
        "What? You’re leaving?!",
        "No! You guys can’t leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!",
        "(spinning the bottle) So, Spin the Bottle works like this: I spin the bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. (She crawls over to where Gunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on Gunther’s face and decides not to kiss him.) All right. Who wants to go first?",
        "Yay! Emily!",
        "Okay, my turn!!",
        "It’s okay! It’s okay! It kicked once, it’ll kick again!",
        "All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.",
        "Just a bug.",
        "No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn’t working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.",
        "Hi!",
        "Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye cheer. So okay! (Runs into the living room) Ready! Okay! Gimme an ‘E!’",
        "Gimme an ‘M!’",
        "Gimme an ‘I!’",
        "Gimme an ‘L!’",
        "Gimme a ‘Y!’",
        "What do you get? (She throws her pom-poms to Joey and Phoebe and performs a cartwheel.) Emily!! (Tries to do another one.) Emil—Whoa!! (She falls in Chandler’s room.) Okay! So that’s me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum! (Gunther’s the only one that claps.)",
        "I’m fine! I’m fine! I’m just losing a tooth, it’s no big deal. I have a dentist! Y’know. I’m gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. (She goes over to the ice and Joey and Monica follow her.) What do I do now? What do I do now?",
        "All right, come on, let’s go get your coat.",
        "Oh, yeah! Real fun. (She makes a decision.) Y’know, this bra… Really, bothers me. (She starts taking off her bra.) Y’know, this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could talk, y’know what they’d say? Wanna hear some memories? (She is now violently pulling on her bra in order to remove it, but it isn’t co-operating.)",
        "Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.",
        "Ughhhh!! Forget it! (Sits down heavily on the bed.) This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.",
        "Can you not look at me when I say this? (He turns around) I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.",
        "Well, I’m sorry, I thought you needed them!",
        "Why?!",
        "You like me?",
        "Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can’t believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!",
        "Oh no-no-no don’t say but! No-no, but’s never good! Let’s just leave it at, you like me and I like you.",
        "Oh, now see that’s a fancy but.",
        "But….",
        "Okay.",
        "Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua’s gone so you and Emily are free to go.",
        "Oh, Ross, I’m sorry. I completely ruined your evening.",
        "Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.",
        "Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?",
        "I’m so sorry.",
        "Well, maybe you didn’t want it to end?",
        "You seem to really like her.",
        "Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.",
        "Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I don’t know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.",
        "Hey.",
        "You’re a pathetic loser, right?",
        "Sit!",
        "Oh my gosh, Joshua!",
        "They’re not true?",
        "Oh.",
        "Oh! Oh, I love that but.",
        "You wanna go inside and have some coffee?",
        "Okay. (Joshua goes inside and to Chandler.) Every time.",
        "How does going to a strip club help him better?",
        "Um-hmm. (Joshua turns to look in the mirror and leaves Rachel staring at his ass.) There we go. There it is.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Oh, okay. Uhh, well let’s see. (Grabs his hand.) You’re about—well uh, this one is large. And this one—(Grabs the other hand.)",
        "Yeah! Okay, two larges coming right up!",
        "Yes.",
        "Sure. You got it. Great!",
        "Me, Fladermouse, great. I really—(motions to Joshua.)",
        "So? (She puts her hands in his, totally forgetting about the gloves, and hoping for something more intimate.)",
        "Ohh! Right! Right, sorry, I’ll be right back!",
        "Oh.",
        "No! Nothing!",
        "Yeah! That would be great!",
        "(shocked) Well, I-I guess—I…",
        "Yeah, great, you betcha!",
        "What?",
        "Oh. Oh, right.",
        "Oh yay!",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Hey, Monica!",
        "Ohh, it’s Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So… What are you gonna do?",
        "No! Help me!",
        "Phoebe?",
        "Ugh!",
        "Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is—I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y’know the \"Wouldn’t it be great if she was my wife\" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?",
        "Ohh! (Realises that Ross is in the room.) Hi!",
        "So….",
        "Ohhhh, come on!!!",
        "No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!",
        "I’ll be right there! (to Ross) Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we’ve gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?",
        "Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! (Monica opens the door.) Emily?",
        "I’m Rachel Green.",
        "There’s been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I’m not free tonight. So…",
        "Oh well, no I…",
        "I’ll get her.",
        "Hey—whoa, slow down. (Gets a whiff of him) No, keep moving. (Joey runs off.) Wow!",
        "Well, I didn’t see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face.",
        "The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.",
        "No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, \"I’m Rachel Greep! I’m Rachel Greep!\" and he let her right in.",
        "No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can’t believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.",
        "Honey, that’s you’re name.",
        "What? Who the hell is Emily—(realises) noooo!!",
        "They’re in Vermont!! How could this happen?! (She waves her arms franticly and hits Chandler.)",
        "How—how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?! (She hits Chandler again.)",
        "I don’t get this! She was horrible! (She hits Chandler, yet again.)",
        "I don’t care! All right, y’know what I’m just upset that I’m getting nowhere with Joshua that—y’know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!",
        "Oh, y’know, would you just for once, not remember every…little…thing!! (Storms out.)",
        "(joining them) Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn’t call. I mean you’d think he’d be worried about me not showing up at his club. Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!",
        "(entering) I can’t believe it! He still hasn’t called.",
        "It’s Joshua.",
        "No, I don’t.",
        "Yeah, come on! What’s going in on in there? (Pats his chest.)",
        "See, I don’t know, for me it would have to Chantal.",
        "Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh…",
        "Well, are we all together? Like in a group?",
        "Oh, hey!",
        "What?",
        "Oh, hmm.",
        "Joshua.",
        "Yeah, I…",
        "Oh, thank goodness!",
        "Oh, no problem. I’m so glad I could help. Happy for you. (She playfully punches him.)",
        "No, happy for you! (Hits him harder.)",
        "No-no-no, that’ not Joshua.",
        "All right, y’know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat? (She makes a move for the remote.)",
        "Honey, what are you doing? That’s too heavy.",
        "Give it here. (She takes the table.) Oh, God. (And gives it to Monica right away.)",
        "Is that the heartbeat?",
        "Oh wow! This is so cool.",
        "Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!",
        "What’s that song? It has been in my head all day long.",
        "Y’know who doesn’t even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.",
        "No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.",
        "Yes!",
        "I’m going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny. (As she exits, Phoebe enters.) Hey, Pheebs!",
        "Hey!",
        "Well, so, why don’t you just turn it off?",
        "Well, what-what ‘cha got there?",
        "Honey, you’re not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.",
        "Hey!",
        "Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised…",
        "Okay.",
        "(interrupting) Relaxi-Taxi!",
        "Well, well I can up with it!",
        "Well, I…",
        "Okay, it’s not Relaxi Cab. It’s Relaxicab, like taxicab.",
        "(To the woman sitting in front of her) He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?",
        "Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.",
        "Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can’t pretend that didn’t happen can I?",
        "Monica, what should I do?",
        "What?",
        "Whoa, wait, listen, I think I’m just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.",
        "Okay, you’re right. You’re right. You can’t help me.",
        "Oh, hi!",
        "Hi. Sorry, things aren’t working out so well.",
        "Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she’s gonna get over this, y’know? I mean, so you said my name! Y’know you just said it ‘cause you saw me there, if you’d have seen a circus freak, you would’ve said, \"I take thee circus freak.\" Y’know, it didn’t mean anything, it’s just a mistake. It didn’t mean anything. Right?",
        "Right…",
        "(laughs) Y’know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.",
        "Get the hell out of there, y’know?",
        "Well, look at that, same thing.",
        "Ross said my name. Okay? My name. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me! (They both just stare at her.) Okay, don’t believe me, I know I’m right—do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?",
        "Okay.",
        "Hello? Oh, Pheebs! (To them) It’s Phoebe!",
        "Hi!",
        "Well, Ross said my name.",
        "Okay, Pheebs, y’know what, let’s look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then…",
        "(entering, carrying an armful of those little soaps.) Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there’s a whole cart outside… (Sees the Walthams and stops.)",
        "(she stops and turns) Hi!",
        "Well, I-I-I’ve been on Standby for a flight home for hours.",
        "Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?",
        "So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?",
        "Yeah. I’m sorry.",
        "No, you’re not an idiot, Ross. You’re a guy very much in love.",
        "No, you know what, I think you should go.",
        "Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it’d be really good.",
        "Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Good!",
        "Right!",
        "Right!",
        "Okay, I’ll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.",
        "What? Wait, what?",
        "Well-well, I don’t know Ross—really?",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!",
        "Okay!",
        "All right!",
        "Oh, okay, we’re going. Yeah.",
        "Oh, wait-wait-wait…",
        "Okay. Wait! Wait!",
        "Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot and uh, (points to Ross’s seat.) he will have a white wine spritzer. Woo! (Looks out the window.) Hey, look at that, the airport’s moving. (Realizes that that’s not how it works.) Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the captain know that we’re moving? (Sits back in defeat.) Oh my God. Oh, my gosh.",
        "Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing. (She’s holding two frilly, lace nighties.)",
        "Sorry. I’m so exited! I’ve been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I’m making him a very fancy meal.",
        "What am I making him by the way?",
        "I thought I was making him filet mignon?",
        "Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.",
        "Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. (They kiss.) Ahh. So, dig in!",
        "(taking a bite) Hmmm!",
        "Oh I know, my God, this is so—this rice is so—I am so good.",
        "(sees the chick and the duck) Oh, yeah, I’m sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.",
        "Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.",
        "All gone! So, farm birds, huh?",
        "Oh.",
        "Okay. So, can I serve you a little of—What? What? What? (She sees that Joshua isn’t relaxed.)",
        "But, they’re across the hall! I mean that’s two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.",
        "Okay, y’know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y’know go to your apartment.",
        "Your parents’?",
        "Ohh.",
        "Yeah that works.",
        "Wow! This place is fabulous!",
        "Whoa-whoa, there’s two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must’ve been a real babe magnet.",
        "Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?",
        "That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?",
        "Ah.",
        "Hi you!",
        "I know, I can do more than cook.",
        "Ohh! It’s so nice to meet you. (She goes over and shakes their hands.) Hello.",
        "Hello.",
        "What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not—that’s-that’s not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. It’s-it’s, they’re-they’re wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale’s, so… And obviously in uh, in-in this case, (She grabs a pen and paper) I am going to report back, \"USA not ready.\"",
        "Yes!",
        "Well, we were going to do that after—I mean umm, next.",
        "Oh, yeah, well… Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin’ around the house.",
        "Yes.",
        "Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.",
        "No, it’s all right. I got nice boobs. (Phoebe and Monica nod there heads in agreement.)",
        "So?",
        "Huh.",
        "She’s totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.",
        "Absolutely! Absolutely!",
        "What—yeah—what, y’know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.",
        "Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!",
        "Oh! It’s you. (She stops doing the dishes.) Hi.",
        "Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so…",
        "Oh.",
        "Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but I’m okay.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, that’s sweet.",
        "(breaking the hug) Uhh, hang in there?",
        "I mean maybe you didn’t hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?",
        "Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has—yeah. Oh no, those were four great dates.",
        "Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean y’know, emotionally, mentally, physically…",
        "I know isn’t it? It’s like I’m right there with Joshua.",
        "You are right there with Emily. And it’s y’know, it’s kinda like…. it’s a tie! Well, I gotta get, I gotta get back to the dishes.",
        "Oh yeah? Fine.",
        "Oh yeah, no, what’s that?",
        "That would be great!",
        "(to the closed door) Hang in there. You hang in there. (Gives him the raspberry.)",
        "No, just singing. (Does a little song.)",
        "(entering) Hi!",
        "Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There’s nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn’t for me and Joshua. Y’know, they’re not gonna get married anyway!",
        "Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it’s ridiculous! I mean, they’re gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they’ve done and they’re call the whole thing off. I’m telling ya, you’re gonna be dancing at my wedding before you’re dancing at there’s.",
        "Why not?",
        "Nothing.",
        "In a month?",
        "You mean, you mean 30 days?",
        "From now?",
        "Well, that’s great.",
        "Hi!",
        "Ohh, nothing, I just wanted to see you. See you and hug you. (Hugs him) See you.",
        "Yeah! (She sits down) Sit!",
        "I’m more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?",
        "‘Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are, I think we are so on the right track! Y’know? I mean, I think we are working, I think we are clicking. Y’know?",
        "Yeah-yeah, y’know if-if there was just like one little area where I—that I think we need—we would need to work on; I-I would think it was we’re just not crazy enough!",
        "Well, yeah, right, y’know what? Yeah, you’re right, I mean, we no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if (Grunts uncomprehensively)……I mean, I mean like craaaazy! Y’know? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound y’know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married?",
        "Oh, I know, I know, it’s-it’s so, it’s so totally like, \"Whoa! Can we do this?\" Y’know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right! Don’t you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don’t you think?",
        "(entering from her bedroom) Well, I just called Joshua…",
        "Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married—I’m just going through a hard time.",
        "Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue.",
        "Yeah, maybe, but I don’t think I even care. I don’t think he’s the one I’m sad about. Y’know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don’t think I’m handling it all that well.",
        "And I-I am just trying to figure out why.",
        "Well, yeah, y’know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.",
        "Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.",
        "Three people. Joshua’s not gonna be there.",
        "Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.",
        "Well, apparently he scares easy.",
        "It’s okay. Sometimes, things don’t work out the way you’d thought they would.",
        "(breaking the hug) Oh, hey, don’t you have to go pick up Emily?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah! I got my girls.",
        "Ugh. (She goes over and lays her head on Phoebe’s lap.)",
        "What?",
        "Y’know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.",
        "Oh, okay! (She goes to answer the door.)",
        "I’m not gonna marry Chandler!",
        "Okay, you guys, just relax. (She goes over to open the door, and as she does, she says.) I doooo. (Sees that it’s Joshua, not Chandler that knocked on the door.)",
        "Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! (Pause) (Comes back inside) Yeah, well, that oughta do it.",
        "I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!",
        "You-you're not wearing a jacket.",
        "Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.",
        "Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.",
        "(entering) Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.",
        "They're male nurses.",
        "Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?",
        "What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.",
        "What?",
        "Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.",
        "Joey, how do you make that dirty?",
        "Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!",
        "Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!",
        "Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!",
        "Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane.",
        "Me?!",
        "No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!!",
        "No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.",
        "Y'know who I always liked? Mork.",
        "Yeah, but umm… Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't hurt, right?",
        "Hi!",
        "Monica, this is Dan (points to him), one of the guys that we're gonna be going out with on Saturday. (Mouths \"He's yours.\" to her.) Uh Dan, Monica.",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh, honey, don’t worry. She's gonna make it on time.",
        "Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh?",
        "Yeah, fair enough.",
        "Oh, how does he look? How does he look?",
        "(entering) Hi. (To Phoebe) Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to tell you that they're still outside making phone calls.",
        "Yeah, umm, no honey.",
        "So does it really hurt as bad as they say?",
        "HEY!! Do you have to do that? It’s Saturday!",
        "I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!",
        "Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.",
        "Monica, you don’t even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!",
        "I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "So—Hey, Pheebs! So, how are the elves?",
        "Yeah, my mom got my dad’s season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Do you guys want these?",
        "Ohh, well you got ‘em.",
        "Just give us our apartment back!",
        "Oh, come on! We know what these are worth.",
        "You’re bachelor pad?!",
        "Or I’ll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.",
        "All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?",
        "Let me finish.",
        "I’m talking about a bet, winner takes all.",
        "Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she’s the only who’s impartial, and she’s so pretty.",
        "What? Shut up! We’re winning!",
        "Okay.",
        "All right, cut, let’s pick again, pick again.",
        "Come on apartment! Come on apartment! (Picks a card.) Oh! I know queen is high!",
        "We took our apartment back!! (Slams the door shut.)",
        "All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.",
        "Let us keep the apartment and…",
        "Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, I-I heard. (Pause, everyone looks at each other, waiting for Rachel’s reaction.) I think it’s great! (Hugs Ross.) Ohh, I’m so happy for you!",
        "(entering) Hi!",
        "Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do.",
        "Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel. (Goes and puts her luggage away.)",
        "Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.",
        "Oh no, you're the best.",
        "What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, \"Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?\" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.",
        "Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.",
        "Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.",
        "That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.",
        "Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't--I still can't believe it. (Rachel grabs the picture from Monica)",
        "I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it (She grabs the rest of the pictures)…",
        "…I mean it's my fault.",
        "Oh my God! (She licks the top picture and hands them back.)",
        "Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda…",
        "Oh, I don't know. I don't know.",
        "All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.",
        "Hey!",
        "Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.",
        "Well…",
        "That's not European!",
        "Oh God, I really had a good time!",
        "Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?",
        "Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this. Umm, okay, just hold on a second.",
        "Umm, hi!",
        "Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.",
        "What's that? (Points to the box.)",
        "Oh, honey that's awful.",
        "But, it's not raining.",
        "Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All right? (She goes out to talk to Dave) Hey, Dave!",
        "Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye! (She goes back in to talk to Ross.) Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now.",
        "Yeah. (She goes out to join her in the hall and starts looking for the dropped socks.)",
        "Ohh! You did not drop any socks!",
        "Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted…tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him.",
        "Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!",
        "Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.",
        "Well… (At a loss for words, she grabs some of Monica's laundry and throws it on the floor as a diversion to allow Rachel to run back inside and close the door. Monica chases her to find that Rachel had locked the door.)",
        "No.",
        "Well, then talk!",
        "Yes!",
        "I'm gonna do it.",
        "But I…",
        "All right, fine.",
        "(stopping him) Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just--y'know--stop it!",
        "Phoebe, woo!",
        "Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.",
        "Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.",
        "Yeah, I-I don't care.",
        "What 'cha readin'?",
        "Yeah, what's it about?",
        "Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.",
        "Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.",
        "Okay.",
        "Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh, (pause) I'm still in love with you Ross.",
        "(Laughing) I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.",
        "Because (laughs), because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know? And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel (laughs) was like, \"You are such an idiot!\"",
        "(laughs) I'm sorry, that's not funny.",
        "Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?",
        "The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.",
        "Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?",
        "That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice. (They hug.)",
        "High-five, the babies are coming! (They all high-five.)",
        "Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!",
        "Hi, sure!",
        "I knew.",
        "I did.",
        "Yeah, maybe...",
        "Really?",
        "Oh Ross, you're so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up]",
        "OK.",
        "Ohhh!!!! [looking at something behind Ross]",
        "Oh, look at the little cat! [a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross] Look at it!",
        "All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!",
        "[to Ross] Yes! Did you see that?",
        "I could not have done this without you.",
        "[hurt] What?",
        "Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?",
        "Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.",
        "'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.",
        "Good. [Ross leaves]",
        "Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I’m doing something that I’m actually good at. I mean. if you don’t get that...",
        "Well neither do I!",
        "(shocked) Oh my God.",
        "Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you’re, you’re, you’re making this too hard.",
        "I don’t know, I don’t know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.",
        "No. (Ross is standing in the doorway.) A break from us.",
        "Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.",
        "So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?",
        "(opening the door) Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here! ",
        "Just get out! Now!!",
        "Okay! All right! How was she?",
        "Was she good?",
        "Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let’s talk about it!! How was she?",
        "Good different?",
        " ...the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you’ve grown. Y'know?  I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, “Once a cheater, always a cheater.”  Ooh, I just wish we hadn’t lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...",
        "You seem to really like her.",
        "Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.",
        "Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.",
        "Yeah.",
        "(entering) Hey guys! What’s up?",
        "What’s this? Is this Ross’s wedding invitation?",
        "Oh, no! No you guys! Come on, you don’t have to do that! I’m happy for him! I am! I really—I’m-I’m happ—I’ll work on it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, honey, I don’t know. I…",
        "No, I’ll think about it. Yeah.",
        "Who's this from?",
        "Oh... [opens it]... [sees it is a pin] Oh my God. He remembered.",
        "It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!",
        "What did you just say?",
        "Oh.... my God.",
        " (seeing Ross come off the plane with another woman.) Oh my God.",
        "Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?",
        " She didn't hang up either...",
        "[on phone] Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat...(cut)...I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure. [hangs up and tosses phone in the ice bucket]",
        "Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . . [jumps the couch and lands on Ross's back, finally getting the phone from him. Ross has a confused expression on his face.]",
        "Ohhhhhhhh God. [climbs off his back]",
        "Ohh, ohh.",
        "Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.",
        "Really?",
        "Oh, god.",
        "Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight.",
        "Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.",
        "Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!",
        "Noo.",
        "Noo! Maybe! I, I don’t know.",
        "I just, I feel, I-I just...",
        "Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!",
        "And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Oh.",
        "I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.",
        "Yeah. It’s just gonna be too hard. Y’know? I mean, it’s Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y’know it’s just, it’s for the best, y’know it is, it’s… Y’know, plus, somebody’s got to stay here with Phoebe! Y’know she’s gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.",
        "I know. (Starts to cry) Yeah, see, there’s so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.",
        "Who are you saying \"check\" too?",
        "Have fun!",
        "Oh, I know.",
        "What?!",
        "Yeah, well, I gotta work, I’m sorry.",
        "Because, I can’t! Ross, I told you, no. I can’t.",
        "Oh, honey! Don’t get up! What do you need?",
        "Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.",
        "Okay, that is all you.",
        "Oh, I don’t know. I guess we have to eat.",
        "I’m just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn’t have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.",
        "(interrupting) Still in love with?!",
        "I’m not in love with Ross!",
        "Phoebe, I’m going to Ross’s wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I’m still in love with him! I mean, hey, y’know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y’know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don’t mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn’t mean that-that I’m still in love with him. Y’know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him—Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my—why didn’t you tell me?!!",
        "We?!",
        "You all know? Does Ross know?",

        "You can?",
        "Um-hmm.",
        "Okay.",
        "Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?",
        "I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.",
        "I don’t know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y’know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.",
        "Okay.",
        "All right.",
        "Okay.",
        "Ow!",
        "Well, I like you less!",

        "(enters with a bag packed) Because I’m going to London.",
        "Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you don’t have those babies until I get back. (Kisses her stomach.)",
        "Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.",
        "Ohh—Do you think he will?!",
        "Y’know what? No. It’s not over until someone says, \"I do.\" (Exits)",

        "(Looking through her purse.) Okay, you know what? I don’t have it, but I can tell you exactly where it is on my night stand, and...okay. But you know what? I have my drivers license and I have a twenty. (She slides it across the counter.)",
        "(Running to her room.) Hi, Pheebs.",
        "(Running back out the door with her passport.) Bye, Pheebs.",
        "Hi, I’m back. Listen, I need to...",
        "Hello. I need to get on the 11 o'clock flight.",
        "Okay, you know what/ You’re going to have to call that plane and tell them to swing around and come and pick me up.",
        "Sure, you know what? Come on, we’ll just tell them that there was like a problem with like the \"engine\".",
        "Look, If I don’t get to London!! He is going to marry that other girl!!!",
        "All right, you know what? I am not leaving here, until you call that plane back!! (She pounds her hand on the counter twice. The ticket agent counters by placing the closed sign on the counter and tapping it twice.)",
        "Ohhh.(she rhythmically taps her hands on the magazine on her lap.)",
        "Yeah?",
        "Oh. I’m sorry. I’m very sorry. Sorry. (She hums and sighs happily.) It’s just, I’m ahh, I’m kinda excited. I’m, ahh, going to London to ahh, tell this guy that I love him and... (He puts his headphones on to ignore her.)",
        "...And so then I realized. All this stuff I had been doing. proposing to Joshua, lying to Ross about why I couldn’t come to the wedding. Was all just a way of...",
        "Ehh, pardon me?",
        "But he has to know how I feel!",
        "(Sighing) Well I-I think your wrong.",
        "Well I just came...(She touches him near his heart. She’s almost in tears.) I just needed to tell you...(Looking into his eyes. She takes a deep breath.) Congratulations. (He hugs her. She can barely hold back the tears.)",
        "So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?",
        "Whoa! Hey-hey, you planning on inviting us?",
        "Hormones!",
        "Nooo!",

        "Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she’s always wanted!",
        "Hi! Phoebe. (Both Monica and her try to move out of Phoebe’s way.)",

        "Well, isn’t that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.",

Finally Chandler was like \"forget about her\" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, \"Oh my god.\" So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh!

And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?",

        "Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, \"ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage.\" Little did she know God was thinking, \"Ok, but that's it.\" Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.",

        "Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?",
        "Everything?",
        "Whoa, that's a lot of stuff.",
        "I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.",
        "[enters] Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.",
        "Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. [Takes Mrs. Green's chin in her hand and says, in Mrs. Adelman's voice] Oh, such a pretty face.",
        "Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.",
        "Sir! No sir!",
        "[Mrs. Adelman's voice] Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.",
        "[Mrs. Adelman's voice] Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! [Phoebe's voice] Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.",
        "I miss Rose.",
        "I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone.",
        "Ok, that's so nice.",
        "Yeah, me, too, technically.",
        "I can't believe two cows made the ultimate sacrifice so you guys could watch TV with your feet up.",
        "Hey cool, mine too.",
        "OK, I can be a waitress, I can be a waitress.",
        "I can be a waitress. OK watch this. Um, gimme two number ones, 86 the bacon, one Adam and Eve on a raft and rick'em, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la.",
        "It's James Bond.",
        "[entering the kitchen from the party] That's funny, no. Cadillac, cataract, I get it, no I get it, you stay out there.",
        "You are so smitten.",
        "Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten. You should ask him out.",
        "So. You two are totally into each other.",
        "OK, so what, you're just never gonna see him again?",
        "Didn't you like, just get your eyes checked?",
        "We have got to get you lazy boys out of these chairs.",
        "You know you should go outside and be with the three-dimensional people.",
        "You guys are so pathetic, I, oh, OH, XANADU! OH.",
        "Hey.",
        "Goodnight.",
        "You're not the only one who has a date tonight.",
        "Oh God, absolutely.",
        "Oh you are so lucky.",
        "Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.",
        "I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.",
        "OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.",
        "I might have.",
        "Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything.",
        "Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having s*x with Fun Bobby out on the terrace.",
        "You have a third nipple?",
        "Yeah, is there a hair on it?",
        "Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades.",
        "OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.",
        "Hi.",
        "Ta-da.",
        "Hi.",
        "Do I? Thank you, so do you.",
        "Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy. I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice.",
        "Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo.",
        "OK.",
        "Oh, right, OK. Ole.",
        "Um, the matador. [Duncan leaves] Ole, ha ha ha.",
        "So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.",
        "Ohh. . .K. How come?",
        "What?",
        "Huuh.",
        "I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties.",
        "So how long have you known?",
        "And um, and there's actually a, a woman?",
        "Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?",
        "Sure.",
        "I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'",
        "Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?",
        "So, um, have you told your parents?",
        "[handing him the papers] Here you go. You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who. . . no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't th ink either answer would make me feel better.",
        "So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.",
        "Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.",
        "(singing) I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it. My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget.",
        "(singing) Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.",
        "But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk.",
        "And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.",
        "Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could. ",
        "Really?",
        "Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting. How much am I gonna get?",
        "Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing.",
        "Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.",
        "No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. (Out on the sidewalk, singing) When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity. (Someone puts a coin in her guitar case) Thank you! La la la la la la la....",
        "(singing) ... with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar player?",
        "Right. My name was on there, but now it just says \"carrot cake\". So, um, so um, how many chords do you know?",
        "Oh yeah, so you know D?",
        "Ok, do you know A minor?",
        "Ok, do you know how to go from D to A minor?",
        "Ok. Um, so does your guitar have a strap?",
        "Oh. Mine does. (singing) Stephanie knows all the chords. (makes a face)",
        "(singing angrily) Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!",
        "(singing/screaming) You're all invited to bite me!",
        "Oh, hi.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.",
        "No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang \"Su-Su-Suicide\", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, \"Smelly Cat\", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.",
        "It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money.",
        "Really? From who?",
        "Yeah. Here you go.",
        "No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's \"smelly cat, smel-ly cat\".",
        "Better. Yeah.",
        "Yeah, much better. And you know what, don't feel bad, because it's a hard song.",
        "You wanna try it again?",
        "Ok, there is no top. That's the beauty of Smelly Cat. Um, why don't you just follow me?",
        "Mmmm hmmm.",
        "That's too much. Sorry.\nEND",
        "Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls.",
        "I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.",
        "Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.",
        "Hey.",
        "Happy Christmas Eve Eve. [sees Ross's picture frame] Oh my God, where did you get this?",
        "This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.",
        "No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.",
        "No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.",
        "[showing her pictures] OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.",
        "It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother. [turns to leave]",
        "Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?",
        "Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?",
        "Just, you know, to see... um.",
        "OK, is this really my father?",
        "OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.",
        "Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me.",
        "Oh God.",
        "Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?",
        "OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?",
        "[realizes] Oh.",
        "Oh.",
        "Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. . . OK, um, in Ithica. . . alright, um, Saratoga. . . Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information. [hangs up]",
        "Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.",
        "Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.",
        "No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.",
        "Whattaya mean?",
        "Wow. Thank you.",
        "Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! [blows a kiss to a picture of Einstein]",

        "OK, let's go.",
        "Alright, here, you have to hold this. [hands Chandler a piece of paper]",
        "Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.",
        "Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it. [Chandler jumps out of the car]",
        "Ooh, this is it, 74. [screeches to a halt, Joey and Chandler are thrown into the plexiglass wall in the cab]",
        "Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh.",
        "OK, here I go. I'm goin' in.",
        "OK, here I go. . . here I go. . . I'm goin'. [she just sits in the cab]",
        "OK.",
        "Mailbox.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . .",
        "Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.",
        "Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.",
        "Yeah?",
        "You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.",
        "Oh, I couldn't go in.",
        "Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.",
        "Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?",
        "You guuuyys.",
        "Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?",
        "It's Ross.",
        "Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?",
        "Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.",
        "Let's see!",
        "Wow, look at these prices.",
        "Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.",
        "No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.",
        "I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just...",
        "Not for you.",
        "Fine. All right, fine.",
        "Well, then...Let's.",
        "No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, it's like a skit.",
        "Cool.",
        "So...Thank you.",
        "Actually, it makes us feel that big.",
        "I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.",
        "Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.",
        "Fine.",
        "Ok. One.",
        "We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?",
        "Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, \"hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck\".",
        "Oh.",
        "Oh, some guy she met at the movies.",
        "Hang in there, it's gonna happen.",
        "Because she's your lobster.",
        "C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life. You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their tank, ya know, holding claws like. . .",
        "So, do you have any other possibilities?",
        "What is that sparkly thing?",
        "Do you want a refill?",
        "OK. Ooh, OK, you gotta give me a second, I wanna get this just right. [she sticks out her gut, clears her throat and sniffs her nose and then in her best male voice. . .] Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out. That was really good, I think I'm ready for my pen1s now.",
        "It's not that bad.",
        "Chandler, Chandler.",
        "I think she's OK.",
        "Do the claws again.",
        "Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.",
        "Hey now you have two. [Chandler looks annoyed] Oh, now you have two.",
        "[Standing in living room with Chandler and Joey. She pulls a huge bathing suit out of a box] Hey, Mon, what is this?",
        "See, he's her lobster.",
        "[looking at a water sculpture that looks like a window with rain running down it] Hey, excellent, excellent water-table thing. ",
        "Yeah, well me too, yeah. I think that's the challenge.",
        "So why don't ya show us the rest of your casa?",
        "Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. You are not gonna believe this. I have just been discovered.",
        "Anyway, OK, now promise you won't like, freak out and say how great this is until I'm done, OK.",
        "OK. I just met this producer of this like, teeny record company, who said that I have a very fresh, offbeat sound and she wants to do a demo of Smelly Cat.",
        "I told you not to do that yet. And, she wants to do a video.",
        "I'm not done yet, OK. God. OK, if that goes well, they may even want to make an album.",
        "I'm done now.",
        "Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?",
        "OK. [singing] Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat [back up singers start singing smelly, smelly, smelly, smelly behind her] Oh woah, oh my God. I mean like, who was that?",
        "OH!! Oh I thought they were just watching me. You know, like at, like at an aquarium, ya know.",
        "OK. [singing] Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat [back up singers - smelly, smelly, smelly, really bad smelly cat, it's not your fault] OK, sorry. I'm just, I'm just not getting that everyone um, gets how smelly this cat acually is. I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the cat.",
        "Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh, check it out, oh check it out. It's Smelly Cat the video.",
        "Now OK, I haven't seen it yet so, if you don't like it, well, so what, none of you ever made a video. [puts the tape in] OK.",
        "Oh my God.",
        "I sound amazing. I, I, I've never heard myself sing before. I mean, except in my own head. Oh, this is so cool, now I can hear what you hear.",
        "Oh, I am sorry but I am incredibly talented.",
        "Hey.",
        "Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video.",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.",
        "Well, I can't work with people who would do this.",
        "I mean this poor woman.",
        "The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a video.",
        "Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels.",
        "[singing] Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Everybody.",
        "Monica.",
        "Chandler.",
        "Rachel.",
        "Uh, Ross, those are the only lines we have, sorry. OK, you guys, once more.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oooh, so so so, did you read the book?",
        "Didn't it like totally speak to you?",
        "Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.",
        "Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.",
        "No, 'cause he's yummy.",
        "Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.",
        "Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'",
        "I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.",
        "Um-um, um-um.",
        "Ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind? I would have to say no.",
        "What?",
        "Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date.",
        "Paul.",
        "Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.",
        "I love you goddesses. I don't ever want to suck your wind again.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Is anyone else starting to really like him?",
        "No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.",
        "Why don't you play with your roommate?",
        "Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?",
        "Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?",
        "Oh yeah, it'll be fun. [throws a tennis ball at Eddie's bedroom door]",
        "Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of us had some beers and got to know each other.",
        "Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye.",
        "I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him. [leaves]",
        "And a crusty old man said I'll do what I can and the rest of the rats played moroccas. That's it, thanks, good night.",
        "I know.",
        "Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech. I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the best.",
        "Ok.",
        "Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.",
        "Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture.",
        "Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?",
        "Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?",
        "Why would you kill his fish?",
        "Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks.",
        "But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.",
        "Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say.",
        "Hey.",
        "Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?",
        "Ahh.",
        "Okey-doke.",
        "Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.",
        "I think on my shoulder. [Ross enters]",
        "Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo.",
        "No, I think you should tell them.",
        "OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?",
        "I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.",
        "Here we go.",
        "You're not going?",
        "What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?",
        "I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?",
        "Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?",
        "OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?",
        "OK, who is the boss of you?!!",
        "No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. GO!!",
        "Oh that looks so good, oh I love it.",
        "Ahh. OK, let's see yours again.",
        "Oh OK. [pulls over her shirt and shows a bare shoulder] Oh no, oh it's gone, that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went.",
        "No.",
        "I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",
        "I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?",
        "Wanna see mine, wanna see mine?",
        "OK, well then what is this? [shows her bare shoulder]",
        "OK, that's my tattoo.",
        "OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.",
        "I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you.",
        "[enters] Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.",
        "Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.",
        "Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.",
        "No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.",
        "Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. [Sees a red bump on her arm.] Oh look!",
        "Yeah? Are you sure, really. [She picks up a mirror and sees the white splotches all over her face.]",
        "I, I, I'm hideous.",
        "Come in.",
        "Hey Ryan, what's up?",
        "Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.",
        "Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.",
        "'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.",
        "Ohh, ohh.",
        "Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.",
        "Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.",
        "And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... [she unveils herself right as a huge lightning bolt crashes outside. Ryan screams in terror.] Oh, I am scary.",
        "I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.",
        "Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.",
        "That you don't stop talking about it.",
        "Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. [She picks up the dice.] Here we go, double sixes, here we go... [She starts to rub the dice all over herself.] Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice...",
        "No. This is what I do for luck, ok.",
        "No.",
        "No. Here. [Throws them on the table.] There. Ooh, double sixes.",
        "Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body. [Grabs a handful of the houses.]",
        "Give it.",
        "Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good. [She starts scratching him.]",
        "Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.",
        "Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.",
        "It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up.",
        "Please. [Ryan pulls the cork with his teeth and spits it into Phoebe's mits.]",
        "I got it. [Wipes it up with her mits.]",
        "What?",
        "Oh.",
        "You know what, that's it, that's it. [She rips off the mits, Ryan follows her lead.]",
        "Ok, I'll walk you out.",
        "I know. We didn't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that. [They kiss.]",
        "Bye you. [Ryan's cab drives off. As Phoebe is going back in, she sees the Central Perk sign in the window and laughs.]",
        "Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there.",
        "No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name.",
        "And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.",
        "No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.",
        "Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him.",
        "Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.",
        "Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'.",
        "Thanks. [gets out of the cab]",
        "[a little dog starts attacking her leg] Hey, hey, no, oh oh.",
        "No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wanna love all animals, please no.",
        "Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap. [Flings the dog off and jumps in the cab. The dog keeps jumping up to the window.] Ok, alright, we have a problem.",
        "Are you crazy?",
        "Yeah, I don't know.",
        "I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.",
        "Ok, thanks. Sorry, again",
        "[innocently] What was that?",
        "[enters] Hey.",
        "Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow.",
        "Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.",
        "I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.'",
        "Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok. [goes over and grabs the phone that's sitting by Monica]",
        "So talk to her.",
        "Hi.",
        "It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose. She's a vegetarian.",
        "Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast.",
        "Sure, oh, is, is Frank home.",
        "Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here?",
        "Oh, ok, um, I mean Frank senior.",
        "Ok so will he be back soon?",
        "Alright, I'm, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry.",
        "Um well I don't really. Just genetically. He's kinda my dad too.",
        "Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?",
        "Oh.",
        "Stilts?",
        "Wow.",
        "I don't know what to do with that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'",
        "That'll work too.",
        "Yeah, that'd be ok.",
        "Ok, I'm in the book.",
        "Alright. So um, stilts huh?",
        "Ok.",
        "Hey nice boobs.",
        "Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.",
        "Why not her?",
        "I'm sorry, I didn't know.",
        "Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.",
        "Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?",
        "Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?",
        "And because you're both, you know, white women.",
        "[cutting Mrs. Greene off] Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon. [they go in the bathroom]",
        "Listen if you wanna go, just go.",
        "Alright, I can get you out.",
        "Shh. In a minute, I'm gonna create a diversion. When I do, walk quickly to the door and don't look back.",
        "Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?",
        "Great, I'm seeing water rings again.",
        "Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute.",
        "No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious.",
        "There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.",
        "Everything you've heard is true.",
        "[enters with the three people she got out] Ok, welcome to the fu-oh.",
        "Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.",
        "Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. [opens the door, the guys are right there] Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.",
        "Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway.",
        "Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.",
        "See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's The Boss.",
        "(singing) Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za.",
        "Hi Monica!",
        "Oh my God, has she slept at all?",
        "Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.",
        "Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal. (Ross gives her this look, like 'Yeah, doesn't it', and gets up to dump it down the drain.)",
        "Maybe, because you told him not to.",
        "Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that.",
        "Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.",
        "Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!",
        "No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!",
        "Rach, look! (she holds two buns up to her ears to make her hair look like the Princess Leia 'do.) Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me. (Ross stands up horrified) There he is.",
        "( in a soothing voice) Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place.",
        "All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!",
        "Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.",
        "Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....",
        "All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....",
        "All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....",
        "Monica, do you want us to take you home?",
        "Hey. Watcha guys doin?",
        "Why are you guys so upset? It's Old Yeller, it's a happy movie.",
        "C'mon, happy family gets a dog, frontier fun.",
        "What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?",
        "Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.",
        "He doesn't have rabies, he has babies. That's what my mom said.",
        "What, what's about to happen? [starts watching] I've never seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun? Oh no, no no Travis, put down the gun. No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller, no, no no, the end, THE END. [hear the gunshot from the TV]\n[Scene:Monica and Rachel's apartment. Richard is on the balcony smoking and Monica is on the phone.]",
        "Hey.",
        "Ok, Love Story, Brian's Song, and Terms of Endearment.",
        "Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.",
        "Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies.",
        "With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.",
        "Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.",
        "Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.",
        "Sure.",
        "Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.",
        "Me too. [leaves]",
        "Hey. Oh thanks for the great movie tip.",
        "Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.",
        "I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, \"It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does.\"",
        "[pauses the tape] Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so. Ok, here we go. [starts the tape again]",
        "Oh, I'm so glad you're here.",
        "Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing (Chandler and Monica, give her a look that says 'think about it') Ooh.",
        "All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.",
        "Uh-huh, let's go. (they move in to kiss) Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. (they kiss rather passionately) Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.",
        "(laughing) Oh my God, you look so good!",
        "Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?",
        "All right, stop it, you're freaking me out.",
        "I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like.",
        "Come on, like you never talk that.",
        "Bye, good luck.",
        "So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that (points at the computer screen).",
        "What does she mean by HH?",
        "Are you the cutest?",
        "You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy.",
        "It could be like a big giant guy.",
        "We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.",
        "Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'",
        "Well at least we know she's a woman.",
        "Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?",
        "Oh, my.",
        "She wants to meet you in person.",
        "What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.",
        "Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her! (Chandler runs and picks up his shoes) Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww. (Chandler runs to the bathroom, as the computer bing-bongs) No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first. (Chandler runs to the computer) No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much. (Chandler walks slowly into the kitchen)",
        "Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil. I think what you have to do is try not to...",
        "Hey!",
        "No, but he’s always late.",
        "Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, ‘Frank’s always late.’",
        "No, I know, I’m just nervous. Y'know it’s just y'know Mom’s dead, don’t talk to my sister, Grandma’s been sleeping a lot lately. It’s like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You’re so sweet to wait with me.",
        "(entering) Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank.",
        "This is everybody. This is Ross.",
        "Chandler.",
        "Joey.",
        "This is Monica.",
        "And this is Rachel.",
        "I’m gonna get coffee.",
        "Oh yeah! Yeah, no, we’re gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything.",
        "(sits up) Oh, ew!",
        "Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue? Because I can, and my Mom couldn’t, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.",
        "Yeah, yeah. You can do it to. (tries to do it, but can’t)",
        "Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can’t. We don’t have that....",
        "Feburary 16th.",
        "Wow, that’s close. When’s yours?",
        "That’s the same month as Halloween. So, um, what kinda things do you like to do at home?",
        "Okay so, by melting, you meant melting.",
        "So is it like art?",
        "Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom?",
        "Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know I’m just gonna go to bed, I think the fumes are giving me a headache.",
        "G’night, bro.",
        "Here. (gives him a fire extinguisher) Y'know, just in case.",
        "No kind. He just makes it up.",
        "So far, it kinda blows. I don’t know, I just thought y'know that he’d feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and....",
        "Ah!!",
        "Oh, how do you play the shadow game?",
        "I just asked you.",
        "I don’t have time for this.",
        "Which you just gave up really quickly.",
        "Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly.",
        "Yeah. (phone rings and Phoebe answers it) ‘Hello. (listens) Oh my God, I totally forgot! (listens) Well can’t someone else do it. (listens) But, I have company. (listens) Yeah, no look, that’s all right I’ll come in.’ (hangs up phone) Um, Frank, I’m really sorry but I have to go to work. It’s-it’s one of my regulars and he’s insisting that I do ‘um.",
        "Oh! I’m a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.",
        "Well, y'know we don’t call it that, but yeah!",
        "All righty. I’ll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come with me?",
        "No, no, you can get one yourself. It’ll be on the house! Y'know what are big sisters for?",
        "No, no, no, I wouldn’t do you myself, I mean that would be weird. Yeah, no, I’ll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun! Hey! Are you excited?",
        "Hey!-Hey! What’s going on?",
        "You can’t have s*x with her!",
        "Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes.",
        "(turns around and hits Frank) So that’s what you thought I did!! God! That’s not what I do!",
        "Nooo! Why would you think that?",
        "Whatever, it’s the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways.",
        "You really thought it was perfect?",
        "Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?",
        "I don’t....",
        "Right, okay, um-mm.",
        "Yeah, I guess I do, yeah.",
        "Well, I-I wasn’t hopping mad, y'know.",
        "Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now, this.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "She wasn’t a hooker.",
        "Maybe all the rulers are wrong.",
        "Who’s singing?",
        "Ewww! Oh! It’s the Mattress King!",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah, I can’t say croissant. (realises) Oh my God!",
        "Ugh! I don’t know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice’s ex-husband, that’s like betraying Chandler.",
        "(sees a little kid playing with a race car bed) (to kid) Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. (the kid just stares at her, and she makes the ‘that went right over your head’ motion) Woo!",
        "Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler’s your friend... (hops onto the bed) Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.",
        "Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?",
        "Ooooh, nice.",
        "Oh, yay!",
        "Oh. (goes and answers the door and there is this huge black delievery guy.)",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It’s that bedroom there. (points to Monica’s room)",
        "Yeah, so please, please, please, don’t say anything to Chandler.",
        "Is that a problem?",
        "Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let’s see what you got. All right ya, put ‘em up. Come on. (they start shadow boxing)",
        "Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren’t acting Christian enough.",
        "Oh! Oh! Oh!",
        "Wow! And I’m a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I’m sorry, we’ll put some ice on it.",
        "‘Kay, put your head back.",
        "All right, I have ya. Oh God.",
        "Oh, it’s the compulsively neat one by the window, okay.",
        "I’m, I’m freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn’t have! All right, I haven’t lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?",
        "I am soo dead. (goes to Monica’s room)",
        "Isn’t it cool! Varoom! Varoom!",
        "I know, you must’ve won like a contest or something!",
        "I’m sorry, okay, I-I wasn’t looking, and the store says that they won’t take it back because you signed for it...",
        "When I was you! Y'know what, it’s all Joey’s fault, ‘cause he left his nose open!",
        "It’s Monica’s bed. What?",
        "So. This has always been Monica’s bed, what you’re just noticing now, how self-involved are you?",
        "Well, if you really, really want it, then it’s okay.",
        "Oh, oh! It's on again!",
        "Hey.",
        "Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! (they all stare at her) Okay,\n        it was me! ",
        "Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean,\n        Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7\n        and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell\n        you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it. (shows\n        him her hand)",
        "Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.",
        "That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my\n        fault.",
        "What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh (starts\n        dialing). ",
        "No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. (on the phone in a different\n        voice) 'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um,\n        is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'",
        "(on phone) 'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey\n        Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak\n        to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to\n        do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns\n        down the apartment, the world does not stop.'",
        "(on phone) 'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition,\n        that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll,\n        what time can you see him?' (to Monica) I need a pen. (Chandler\n        hands her one, but she needs something to right on, so she\n        tilts Chandler's head over and writes on the back of his neck)",
        "Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone\n        again?",
        "(on phone, in 'Katelynn's' voice) 'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay\n        returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have\n        to patch you through.'",
        "(in voice, on phone) 'Okay, go ahead.' (in normal voice on\n        phone) Um, hi Annie. (listens) Fantastic! (to Joey) You got\n        it. (on phone) Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work for scale?' you ask\n        me. Well, I don't know about that, (Joey clears his throat to\n        signify yes) except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are\n        such a sweetheart. I would love to have lunch with you, how\n        about we have lunch next....(hangs up phone) Op, went through\n        a tunnel.",
        "It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone\n        before.",
        "Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.",
        "Two?",
        "Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right",
        "(entering) Helloo! Oh! (sees Joey and starts to leave)",
        "No it's not, sorry.",
        "Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in\n        those....pants.",
        "Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't\n        get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",
        "But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a\n        terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the\n        person who makes your face look like that.",
        "Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry\n        I quit, okay, I just quit.",
        "Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an\n        Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.",
        "Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this\n        job! I...",
        "Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.",
        "Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to\n        work on. ",
        "Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.",
        "No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So,\n        you can work on that. ",
        "Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but\n        dumb'.",
        "Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'",
        "Oh.",
        "Yeah, no, I understand.",
        "Yeah. Sorry. (she starts to leave)",
        "What?",
        "(in a coy tone) Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.",
        "Wow, it’s like a dirty math problem.",
        "Oh, that is so unfortunate.",
        "Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.",
        "You didn’t leave lipstick marks on the phone.",
        "(angrily) Bye-bye! (to Ross) That’s why I moved out.",
        "I think on some levels she already knows.",
        "Okay, well maybe not on those levels.",
        "Why, nobody good?",
        "Oh, really?",
        "So what are they doing?",
        "(to Monica, who’s entering) Hey, you’re early.",
        "I’m just taking it to be re-wired.",
        "No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.",
        "You don’t play the oboe!",
        "Then I’m gonna have to ask you to keep it down. (slams the door in his face.)",
        "Huh?",
        "It’s not in the apartment? (Monica gives a ‘Come on’ look) Oh no. I can’t believe this is happening again.",
        "Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I’ve, I don’t live here anymore.",
        "I’m sorry, I-I-I-I don’t live here anymore. I-I didn’t know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!",
        "That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn’t sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.",
        "Yeah, I would’ve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.",
        "Okay, this is what I’m talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.",
        "Aw, honey it’s not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don’t see that happening.",
        "Aww, good. (they hug) What?",
        "No you’re not, you’re wondering which cushion it is.",
        "Oh, it’s already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?",
        "Oh no! Why?",
        "Oh my God! I don’t believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.",
        "Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?",
        "I’m sorry.",
        "Aw, God Ross. Oh.(goes over and hugs him)",
        "I know no, no, y'know you don’t deserve this, you don’t Ross. You’re, you’re really, you’re so good. (kisses him on the cheek)",
        "And you’re so sweet. (kisses him on the other cheek) And you’re kind (kisses him on the lips)",
        "Huh?",
        "Okay, it’s okay.",
        "Oh. (they start kissing again)",
        "What?",
        "What?",
        "Well, that’s not something a girl wants to hear.",
        "What?",
        "You have chalk on your face.",
        "Oh, Ross you’re right, I don’t know why I always thought this was real grass.",
        "No, no, it’s just my tooth.",
        "No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can’t see him.",
        "Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.",
        "Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there\n        was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend\n        ‘Albino Bob’.",
        "Yes, while I was in the chair! That’s why I take such good\n        care of my teeth now, y'know, it’s not about oral hygiene, I\n        floss to save lives!",
        "Well tell that to them. Oh! You can’t, their dead.",
        "(trying to bite into an apple) Ow! Ow! (drops the apple in\n        disgust.)",
        "All right, fine, fine, but if you’re my next victim, don’t come\n        back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.",
        "Although, don’t feel like you can’t visit.",
        "Well, you could wait ‘til I go to the dentist, maybe I’ll kill\n        him.",
        "Well, I’m going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the\n        look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or,\n        or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay,\n        And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that\n        um...... (starts to cry and runs out)",
        "(running through the door) No! Oh! You’re alive! You’re\n        alive!",
        "Yeah, well, we’ll see about that. Can I use your phone? I\n        just wanna call everyone I know.",
        "(on phone) ‘Hey! You’re not dead! Okay, see ya!’",
        "(rushing in) Okay. If you’re alive you answer your phone!",
        "Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I\n        know, and everyone is alive.",
        "What?",
        "Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this\n        curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.",
        "I’m telling you he’s dead. What we are about to have here\n        is a dead fat guy on a stick.",
        "He’s alive! He’s a-live!!!",
        "(joining him) ‘Love....’",
        "‘I’ll be a fool for you. I’m sure, you know I\n                     don’t mind.’",
        "‘Yes! You mean the world the world to me.\n                     Oh..’",
        "‘I know.’",
        "‘I’ve found....’",
        "‘...in you, my endless (Phoebe goes high\n                     pitched, Chandler goes low pitched) love.’ (they\n                     both look at each other.) ‘My endless love.’ (once\n                     again they don’t match tones, and they just look\n                     at each other)",
        "Why don’t you go up there and ask him to ‘step lightly, please?’",
        "Ooh, that is silly. (gets up) I’ll go up there, I’ll tell him to keep it down.",
        "(muffled through the floor) Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... (I tired but the rest is unintelligible).",
        "(muffled) Oh, thank you.",
        "Well, he’s very charming.",
        "Well, you’re just gonna have to try.",
        "(to one of his sisters, Cookie) Hey!",
        "Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice.",
        "Wow. Okay, I don’t know how to talk to you.",
        "Where’d you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.",
        "Why, what happened?",
        "How can you not know which one?",
        "We didn’t fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!",
        "Oh well y'know. (laughs)",
        "Ick, you were eavesdropping.",
        "Oh, I’m sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me.",
        "Thanks you guys! Thank you.",
        "God, I hope they kick his ass!",
        "Have fun. Oh wait, no, don’t! I forgot I am totally against that now.",
        "No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. (to Joey) Hey, how do you sleep at night?",
        "Really?",
        "(walking up to Joey) Hey.",
        "Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, (looks at the tree) oh, but oh...",
        "Destiny.",
        "Yes.",
        "Okay. (One of Joey’s co-workers, walks by with a dead tree.) Yikes! That one doesn’t look very fulfilled.",
        "You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.",
        "So, what happens to the old guys?",
        "Why, do I have a feeling that’s not as happy as it sounds? (Joey points out one going into the chipper to her, as this haunty, demonic music starts to play in the background) No! Nooooo!!! (she winces in horror and hides her face against Joey’s shoulder, as she sees the tree spit out from the chipper.)",
        "(running up carrying a tree) Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you don’t want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one. (points to the almost dead tree she has)",
        "Okay but that’s why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it’s Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey",
        "Well look no further, (shows her the dead one) this one’s yours! Ahhh.",
        "All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one! I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to get so emotional, I guess it’s just the holidays, it’s hard.",
        "Oh, I wasn’t even thinking about that.",
        "This is the worst Christmas ever.",
        "Oh! Oh my God!",
        "You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you’re the best!",
        "Oh, God bless us, everyone.",
        "(entering, with about 20 purses hanging around her neck) Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses!",
        "Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.",
        "Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it.",
        "A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich�. Why don't you get a magician?!",
        "Well, can you dance at all?",
        "(covering her mouth in shock) What, what is that?",
        "Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita?",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!",
        "What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, (reading) 'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!",
        "Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "What are you wrapping?",
        "Yeah, it's a vase.",
        "Well not exactly like the one in the poem.",
        "Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh. (hugs her)",
        "Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.",
        "Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. (just as she sits down).",
        "Oh, can I play too? I’ve never played football, like ever.",
        "Yay!!",
        "Okay, so how do we decide that?",
        "Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle.",
        "Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?",
        "Yeah.",
        "What’s block?",
        "I thought you meant in life.",
        "Go! Go! Go!",
        "Oh I got it!! (catches the ball) Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!",
        "Touchdown!! Touchdown!!",
        "Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Woo-yay!!",
        "I love this game!!",
        "Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!",
        "All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?",
        "Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.",
        "Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.",
        "Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn’t the play still going.",
        "Isn’t there a national football league.",
        "Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?",
        "(entering, holding a pair of Roller Blades) Hi.",
        "Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that’s he’s going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff.",
        "I’m going to let him.",
        "Oh, there’s no such thing as an innocent burger.",
        "Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.",
        "(to Robert) You’ve have lipstick right here (points to her cheek). That’s okay, it’s mine, we just kissed.",
        "I’ll have coffee.",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.",
        "Oh, I get more because I’m dainty.",
        "Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter?",
        "What? (the guys keep laughing.) What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert? (the guys keep laughing.) Why are you laughing?!",
        "You guys!! Come on!",
        "What do you mean?",
        "Hey.",
        "Hey. Ooh! Don’t sit down!",
        "Yeah. And, first here’s a gift.",
        "That’s all right, that’s well, I figured.... (they start to leave as Joey enters.)",
        "Listen, Robert’s gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?",
        "Please, right now, no, every time I see him it’s like ‘Is it on the lose?’ ‘Is it watching me?’",
        "Hey.",
        "No, I can spot you from here.",
        "Okay, listen Robert...",
        "Umm, I think you’re really, really great...",
        "I-I-I-I-I don’t know, I don’t know what to say.",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?",
        "Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.",
        "The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.",
        "Now what is Fabutec?",
        "Waxine!!",
        "Oh, it’s incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.",
        "God. Do think it really doesn’t hurt? ‘Cause how can they do that?",
        "They have the best stuff in there.",
        "(reading from the instructions) After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,",
        "Grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.",
        "Was it not pain-free?",
        "Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’t seem to think it’s that bad.",
        "(Removing one of the strips) Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!",
        "Oh!!",
        "Ow!!!",
        "Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!",
        "We’re all right.",
        "We’re all right.",
        "For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.",
        "Oh yeah, come here. (Puts a little wax on Joey’s arm and puts a strip on it.)",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "(to Joey) What, what are they talking about?",
        "Whe-where did he put it?!",
        "Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.",
        "Should we do something?",
        "Hi, it’s Phoebe. Listen someone’s gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, ‘cause it’s like 9:15 now, and I’m not there.",
        "We could eat the wax! It’s organic.",
        "No, not the used wax.",
        "They’re gonna get through this, aren’t they?",
        "Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.",
        "They’ve been quiet for a long time.",
        "(entering) Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas!",
        "I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages outside the UN and, I don’t know where his country is.",
        "Oh!! That’s my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace.",
        "Ick-neck-tree-anis..... There’s a ‘g’ in there.",
        "In your atlas!",
        "Oh.",
        "Oh.",
        "Umm, well he’s very dashing, y'know, and umm, very, very sophisticated, and he doesn’t speak any English, but according to his translator, he totally gets me.",
        "What is this?",
        "Me too. Although this city is my home, so. So that’s dumb what I said, don’t tell him I said that. Umm, you make something up. (Mischa does so and Sergei kisses her hand.) Nice, (to Mischa) thank you. This is me. Here.",
        "(to Mischa) Thank you, very much! Oh! (to Sergei) Thank you!",
        "(to Mischa) Okay, y'know what, you don’t have to do that now. (Mischa translates that to Sergei) No-no-no-no!! Not him, you don’t! (Mischa tells Sergei he can proceed and steps away) Well the moment’s over.",
        "Oh.",
        "(pointing to the globe) See there it is right there.",
        "Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.",
        "Yeah. Except for, y'know when you’re on a date and you’re getting along really great but the guy’s translator keeps getting in the way.",
        "(to Monica) Anyway, I’m going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator’s date? So that when we, it’s time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he’s really, he’s kinda cute.",
        "Hey, don’t call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!",
        "(laughing and banging her spoon on the table) Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.",
        "You didn’t say Boutros Boutros Gali.",
        "Interesting.",
        "Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.",
        "Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. (Behind the menu) What are you doing?",
        "Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven’t been able to say two words to each other.",
        "That would be great. Thank you.",
        "Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don’t accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it.",
        "Well, tell him, apology accepted.",
        "Excuse me, but umm, isn’t he paying for your dinner?",
        "Plate! Yes, plate.",
        "See, we don’t need them.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Ameri-can.",
        "Ameri-can. Y'know it’s a very hard language. Let’s do it again.",
        "Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.",
        "(to Chandler) Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?",
        "Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she’s done.",
        "Oh no, one of those ‘look for the hidden meaning’ songs.",
        "Hey Leslie, how’d you know I’d be here?",
        "Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.",
        "Hmm, bummer.",
        "No. But thanks.",
        "Okay. No. But thanks.",
        "Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y’know. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. (to Monica) Can I have a tissue, please?",
        "Where’s Chandler?",
        "Oh. (takes her beeper puts in a pot, covers it, and puts the pot in the oven)",
        "Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. That’s the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!",
        "Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together.",
        "You never run on a barge!",
        "Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!",
        "It’s just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn’t called. Not that I even care, y'know.",
        "You think you know me so well.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That’s what I said.",
        "I can’t. I can’t. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was ‘Okay, bye Pheebs’ gone. Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I’ve ever had in like all my lives.",
        "(singing) I stepped in something icky.",
        "(singing) Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, it’s not your fault.",
        "Oh, yeah!",
        "I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.",
        "Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I’d be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.",
        "That’s okay. All right, I’m gonna play song that’s really, really sad. It’s called Magician Box Mix Up. (she turns her guitar upside down to play it.)",
        "(to Leslie) Oh, I thought you weren’t coming. What? Where were you?",
        "Okay, don’t give me a reason to get mad, okay",
        "No, look, I told you that I didn’t want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would’ve done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can’t trust you then just forget it.",
        "Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won’t be partners. So what’s it gonna be?",
        "Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life’s gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song?",
        "Okay. (singing) ‘Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.’ That’s all I have so far.",
        "Oh come on, they can be in the same room.",
        "Why? What happened now?",
        "Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He’s the one who slept with someone else.",
        "Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you’re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.",
        "Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....",
        "Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.",
        "(turning around and picking a cup off of a table) Oh, hey, look, I found coffee! (handing her the cup) Okay, let’s skedaddle.",
        "Okay, your highness.",
        "(in a deep voice, imitating Ross) Um, Rachel I’m really sorry. (imitating Rachel) That’s okay, do you wanna get back together? (imitating Ross) Yeah, okay. (in her normal voice) Did anyone else hear that?!",
        "Hey!",
        "No, it’s just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.",
        "Ohhh boy, do I feel bad.",
        "Chandler what are you doing?!",
        "Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?",
        "Him? Him, Ross?",
        "Wait. Really?! ‘Cause mine get me out of tickets.",
        "Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel’s sister’s cabin. (Chandler goes back to the window to smoke again.)",
        "Y'know what, I can stay, I’m gonna stay. ‘Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.",
        "Chandler!!",
        "What does the sign say?",
        "No, the ‘No Smoking’ sign. There’s no smoking in my Grandmother’s cab.",
        "Please!",
        "(to Rachel, who’s staying in the cab.) Aren’t you gonna go?",
        "No, y'know what don’t close it (Rachel slams the door shut locking themselves out.) ‘cause the... keys...are in there.",
        "Okay, Monica’s are the biggest.",
        "All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.",
        "(finishing removing her bra) Okay, there.",
        "Okay. (The car moves a few feet and sputters to a stop.) Oh, no!",
        "Yeah, this has happened before.",
        "Yep. Put more gas in.",
        "Okay, yeah. (to Monica and Rachel) Triple A can pick us up.",
        "Yeah, what town are we near?",
        "(to Monica) Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we’re on?",
        "Okay. (on phone) We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. (to Rachel) There is no Route 27. (listens) (to Rachel) Okay, either 93 or 76?",
        "Okay. (on phone) Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? (listens) Okay! (hangs up) Yeah, no they don’t do that.",
        "But if...",
        "Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.",
        "(answering the phone) (whispering) Ross, thank God.",
        "I ate a bug.",
        "Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don’t know where we are, so we can’t get a tow truck.",
        "Yes, please.",
        "Oh, it’s Ross on one of his drives!",
        "Hi!",
        "(to Chandler and Monica) You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we’re then gonna go skiing?",
        "Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.",
        "Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! (they all stop fighting, Chandler continues to dance.) Look what you’re doing to Chandler!! (Chandler finally stops) (to Ross and Rachel) Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? (Ross starts to leave) You don’t, all right you don’t have to love each other, okay? You don’t, you don’t even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.",
        "Yeah, otherwise, I mean that’s, that’s, that’s just it for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? (they both look away) Can you be civil?",
        "Okay. Good, all right, let’s get back in the car, ‘cause it’s freezing, and my chest is unsupported.",
        "Maybe we can like go to a movie or something.",
        "Or, or the rodeo!!",
        "Okay!",
        "Bye!!!",
        "All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.",
        "Oh my God!!",
        "Frank! Hi!",
        "What are you doing here?",
        "What happened?",
        "But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?",
        "Your getting married?!",
        "My little brother’s getting married!!",
        "Do I?",
        "Yeah, I do, yeah.",
        "Yeah, isn’t it fantastic?",
        "What, he’s 18.",
        "Yeah, I’m a big surprise.",
        "Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you’re ready for that?",
        "Oh good! Okay. ‘Cause you were acting like you didn’t.",
        "No, I know, I know, that this is Frank’s life, (walks behind them, they turn around in the leather chairs to face her) y'know. Y'know, I don’t want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it’s sick and wrong!",
        "No-no, oh, I’m fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it’s tongue down my little brother’s throat!",
        "But, I mean, do you think he’s gonna enjoy it when he’s up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank, (she walks behind them again, and hey again turn to follow her) and it-it’s not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it’s not good home economics.",
        "Yes. Not out loud.",
        "Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he’s gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can’t. (pause) But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.",
        "Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!",
        "Okay, I’m gonna go get Frank. (exits)",
        "(to Joey) You’re Frank’s best man?!",
        "Well then, (to Ross) what about you?! Huh?!",
        "Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I’m so glad you could come, ‘cause I’ve got a real umm, Home Ec emergency. (Points to the table cloth, which has a huge mustard stain on it.)",
        "Yeah, I know. It’s a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?",
        "Y'know what, forget it. It’s ruined.",
        "Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.",
        "Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?",
        "Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?",
        "What umm, what happened?",
        "Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?",
        "Yeah, yeah, no, I don’t, I don’t know. But, y'know what, maybe it’s just all for the best?",
        "Oh, sweetie, oh. (hugs him)",
        "Uh, well I can tell you why. It’s, it’s because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?",
        "Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn’t be together, y'know. And you’re gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay, but.",
        "Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn’t. There’s someone here who can explain this better than I can.",
        "Yeah, but not just that.",
        "None the less.",
        "That’s right, exactly. (sees them) All right, it’s a good bye kiss, that’s good. (Frank picks Alice up and they move to the couch) Bye-bye. (They both lie down on the couch and start to make out.) Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I’m saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. (They ignore her) Okay, I’ve decided I’m gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? (She reaches in and Alice moans) Okay, all right, good. (leaves).",
        "We were out of Doritos.",
        "Oh.",
        "Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.",
        "What, so what are you gonna tell him?",
        "Huh.",
        "Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you’re not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.",
        "Okay, so it’s probably just the Ross thing then.",
        "So, you’re like a zillionaire? (Pete smiles and nods)",
        "Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.",
        "Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.",
        "Yeah, kinda.",
        "(to Chandler) Hey! (Chandler looks up, startled) Why isn’t it Spiderman? Y’know like Goldman, Silverman...",
        "It isn’t?",
        "Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!",
        "Okay well, he would turn things to gold.",
        "Ahh, his work is done.",
        "Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!! (they both kick up the foot rests like an old fashioned gun fight.)",
        "Oh, it’s so great to see you feeling like this!",
        "Wait, am I missing something though? ‘Cause I thought death was something that’s supposed to be sad, in a way.",
        "Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.",
        "No, just a barrel.",
        "Really?! Really?!",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It’s so beautiful.",
        "So, I’m here, ready to play.",
        "I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha. (She removes this large ceramic dog that comes up to the second floor and places it next to the house.)",
        "That’s a dog, every house should have a dog.",
        "Well, maybe it’s so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.",
        "No, no, that’s the ghost for the attic.",
        "Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you’ve got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.",
        "Okay, obviously you don’t know much about the U.S. government.",
        "(holding a dinosaur) Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! (the dinosaur starts attacking the house. She starts to bark like a dog.) Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!",
        "Okay, (starts to pack up her stuff) fine. Come dinosaur, we’re not welcome in the house of no imagination.",
        "The little ones do.",
        "Hey!",
        "Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!",
        "Look, look! (She lifts up the roof, and the front panel falls revealing the interior.)",
        "Oh, okay, it’s the slide instead of stairs. Watch this. (She slides a doll down the slide)",
        "The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.",
        "Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room? (lights some incense)",
        "Watch, watch. (She turns a strand of Christmas lights strung around the house.)",
        "And, and! (She turns on a bubble maker.)",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "What?! Oh my... (sees the remains of the house) Oh my God!! What happened?!",
        "All right. Did everyone get out okay?",
        "Ohh. What is this? (She sees a tissue covering something, and moves to remove it.)",
        "(She pauses to ready herself, and removes the tissue.) Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!",
        "Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he’s at Flimby’s.",
        "Oh, yeah, that’s the word I use when I can’t remember the real thing.",
        "No! Rachel, that’s what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow, if I don’t get through, they’re not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! It’s us versus them!",
        "Like a date type (looks at Rachel) person?",
        "Thanks!",
        "Okay. (on phone) Ooh, I’m setting the phone down. (does so) But I’m still here! Just don’t go anywhere I’m still here. (starts to put on the sweater) Don’t-don’t switch or anything, ‘cause I’m, I’m right here. (She has pulled the sweater over her head, but her head is stuck in a sleeve.) Just one sec. One sec! One second!! (She is now frantically trying to get the sweater on, as Monica returns from the bathroom.) Wait! One second! Just…",
        "What?! Monica, I’m scared!!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yes!! Yes!! I’m the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.",
        "No.",
        "Oh, is the play over?",
        "Nah. I kept myself busy.",
        "Oh, okay, yeah. (to Monica) I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff in your room.",
        "No, no, I’m fine, and y’know why? ‘Cause of all the riboflavin.",
        "I’m so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see you’re play. I swear you’re play is very important to us, thank you for your patience. You’re play is the next play is the next play I’m gonna see.",
        "Oh, I… (starts jabbering incoherently)",
        "I do, I believe you.",
        "Yeah. But I also believed her (points to the phone) when she said I was next.",
        "Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it’s one of those 801 numbers. Right?",
        "No, no, no, oh no-no-no, it’s has to be 800. (picks up the instruction manual to check the phone number) ‘Cause all those big companies have 800 numbers, every one. (Finds the number) Yeah, every big Utah-based company has one.",
        "Sorry, I’m so sorry, I will pay you back.",
        "Fine! Fine! (slams the phone down, breaking it) Oh-oh!",
        "Well, I think I broke it. But that’s all right, here’s the number you can call.",
        "Ehh?",
        "I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!",
        "How close?",
        "I don’t even know how that would work!",
        "(interrupting) I’m not asking!",
        "Yeah. Let’s see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.",
        "Yeah, well, everybody does! I’m a really cool person. And y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn’t even try! Y'know what, you walked out on me, and I’m just, I’m gonna do the same thing to you.",
        "I don’t ever want to see you again! ",
        "(walking back in with her hand over her eyes.) Umm, where’s my purse?",
        "Well, umm, my Mom’s friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.",
        "Oh, my new Mom, who-who’s a big, fat abandoner! (starts to go upstairs)",
        "No. I’m just, I wanna, I need to be alone.",
        "(turning around, insistently) Monica!",
        "Well, I’m ready to get the hell out of here! (Sees Ross and Rachel cuddling on the couch.) Oh. Are you? Are you?!! (they nod ‘Yes.’) Ohh! That’s so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. (they nod ‘No.’) But for you, yay! Ohh.",
        "Okay, I’m gonna put this (her suitcase) in the car.",
        "(to the person that answered the door) Hi, Ursula.",
        "Okay, well umm, I know that we haven’t talked in a long time, but umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.",
        "(shocked) You know her?!",
        "There-there was a suicide note?! (Ursula nods ‘Yes.’) Well, do you still have it?",
        "I can’t believe you didn’t tell me there was a suicide note!",
        "I, umm, shut up!",
        "(reading from the note) “Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I’ll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk.” You just wrote this!",
        "Noooo!!",
        "No. I’m-I’m to depressed to talk.",
        "(singing) “...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm.” (applause) Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. (Sees that Phoebe Sr. has entered, and to her) Except for you. You go away.",
        "Okay, bye.",
        "No.",
        "But, it’s not like we’re losing anything. Y'know?",
        "It’s not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common.",
        "I-I like pizza!",
        "Oh my God, so do I!",
        "Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?",
        "Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I’m-I’m mad at you.",
        "Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I’m kinda hungry.",
        "All right, stop it. Now you’re just doing it to freak me out.",
        "All right, so, so you went to Pete’s...",
        "So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?",
        "No-no-no oh, keep your name, don’t take his name.",
        "Well then definately don’t take his name.",
        "(intrigued) Oh?!",
        "(disappointed) Oh.",
        "Yeesh, what’d you do about it?",
        "Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?",
        "Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?",
        "Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren’t together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you’re not cool with it...",
        "You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She’s yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...",
        "Great! Okay, good for you! (as they leave she slaps Rachel on the butt)",
        "Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie. (who has hair by the way)",
        "(to Bonnie) Well I hope you have fun tonight.",
        "Yeah, she was bald, she’s not now.",
        "I don’t know, I hardly ever say that about people.",
        "Well I’m sorry, I thought you said it was okay.",
        "Well, maybe it won’t work out. Maybe Ross won’t like her personality.",
        "Oh no, Bonnie’s the best!",
        "So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?",
        "Ohh, that’s too bad!",
        "Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.",
        "Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?",
        "Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?",
        "No! No! Look at that! (drags her away from the window) It’s a line of ants! They’re working as a team!",
        "(looking in the window) Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let’s go.",
        "Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.",
        "You said it was okay!",
        "What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!",
        "Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don’t get it. Aren’t you the one that decided that you didn’t want to be with Ross?",
        "Well isn’t he your friend? Don’t you want him to be happy?",
        "So?",
        "(sits down next to her and hugs her) Oh no.",
        "Oh, we killed them all.",
        "Wait, if that’s his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?",
        "(to her date) Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music. (points to the stage)",
        "Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people.",
        "Vince is a fireman.",
        "Okay. (watches him leave)",
        "Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.",
        "I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.",
        "Does a dog's lips move when he reads? (Joey makes an `I don't know' face, and looks to Chandler and Rachel, who're also stumped) Okay, no they don't.",
        "That is so great! Oh, I... (sees that a parked car near them has caught on fire) Oh my God!",
        "(the fire has worsened) Oh my God!!!",
        "(stopping him) No! No!",
        "Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic. (hears the sound of approaching sirens) Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out of here!",
        "Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay? (she drags him away)",
        "(entering with Rachel) …and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.",
        "(disgusted) Uh.",
        "Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field.",
        "Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's so burly, he's sooo very burly. (giggles)",
        "Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Jason is not a sissy!",
        "God, that is the nicest kitchen.",
        "No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day.",
        "All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.",
        "Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it’s just Jason’s so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it’s just better than having just like a really, really, really nice (pause) butt. (Her eyes glaze over thinking about the butt.) (pause) Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!",
        "Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?",
        "Wow! I didn’t know you guys actually used those.",
        "Umm, wow. This-this isn’t gonna be easy. Umm, I don’t think we should see each other anymore.",
        "I’m sorry.",
        "Oh my God, I didn’t…",
        "(running after him) Wait-wait-wait! Wait!!",
        "(to Ross) I’m telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.",
        "(gasps) Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. (They both look at her.) Like for clubbing.",
        "Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?",
        "No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he’s incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.",
        "Yeah, well he’d prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.",
        "Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and… Okay so Jason is sensitive, (holds up one finger) but now so’s Vince (holds up one finger on her other hand) Plus, Vince has the body y'know? (holds up two more fingers on the Vince side) So… It’s really just about the math.",
        "(knocks on the door) Jason?",
        "Nah-ha!",
        "(singing) “Crazy underwear, creepin’ up my butt. (Jason enters) Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under-(sees Jason)-wear…” (In her head) Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep playing. You’ll get through this; you’ll be fine. (She tries to continue the song, but she has lost the ability to pronounce words, and the lyrics come out as gibberish.) (giving up on the song) Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show.",
        "Hey!",
        "I don’t know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!",
        "Yeah, okay, I’ve-I’ve been dating both of you, and it’s been really horrible. ‘Cause y'know it’s been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I like you both, and I, and I didn’t know how to chose, so... I’m sorry, I’m just, I’m terrible, I’m a terrible person. I’m terrible.",
        "Really?!",
        "Well, this is none of my business. (starts to walk away)",
        "Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park.",
        "(to Vince) Well, that could’ve been really awkward.",
        "Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I’m gonna do that for you.",
        "(entering, hurridly) Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look\n        at this! (She hands Chandler a picture) That’s my Mom’s\n        writing! Look.",
        "Y'know what that means?",
        "No-no, that’s not, that’s not me Phoebe, that’s her pal\n        Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like\n        B.F.F. (Ross and Bonnie look at her quizzically) Best Friends\n        Forever.",
        "I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of\n        stories about my parents, and she might even know like where\n        my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach.\n        So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?",
        "So great! Okay! Tomorrow we’re gonna drive out to Montauk.",
        "Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this\n        woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy\n        back gives me his beach house.",
        "Oh, I wasn’t talking about his karma.",
        "And this time, they’ve ganged up to form one giant, super hat.",
        "Oy!!",
        "Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.",
        "(at the door) Knock, knock, knock.",
        "(entering) Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?",
        "Hi Phoebe Abott, I’m your best friends daughter!",
        "No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here. (hands her the\n        picture) Lily, from high school. Remember?",
        "(points to herself) Phoebe. (points to her) Phoebe. Phoebe,\n        yeah. She named me after you I guess.",
        "Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That’s my Dad, that’s Frank! Yeah! I’m\n        sorry I’m getting all flingy.",
        "No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks. ",
        "(goes and gets some cookies) Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I’ve\n        been, I’ve been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard\n        from him, or seen him?",
        "(disappointed) Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my\n        parents. Everything.",
        "Oh, what? What was it?",
        "(happily) Yeah, no, it was great.",
        "(entering) Oh, hey!",
        "Oh, so, how are we doing?",
        "I’m kind, caring, and sweet. What’s Monica like?",
        "Ohh, I think she knows where my Dad is.",
        "She was acting, she was pretending like she hasn’t heard from\n        him on years, but I found this picture on her fridge, and look\n        (shows Monica)! Isn’t this what he would look like now?",
        "I don’t know, but we’re having dinner tomorrow night, so I\n        figured, she’s gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just\n        wanted to give him time to, buy me presents, I don’t know! So,\n        you’re all bored?",
        "All right, I’m gonna close my eyes and point to someone, and\n        you, whoever I point has to come up with something fun for us\n        to do, and we have to do it. ",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay. (Starts to spin) Ooh, y'know we could just do this. (She\n        stops at Chandler)",
        "Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody\n        take off one item of clothing. It hasn’t happened yet, but\n        we’re all very excited.",
        "Come on, take ‘em off!!",
        "Shhh! Shhhh! Joey’s asleep.",
        "After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him\n        warm.",
        "She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!",
        "Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. She’s\n        avoiding me, she doesn’t want to tell me where my Father is.\n        She knows, and she won’t tell me.",
        "Yeah, well, don’t \"Aww Pheebs, that sucks!\" me yet. (she starts\n        to leave)",
        "Well, she’s out of town so, there’s gotta be something in her\n        house that tells me where my Father is.",
        "Well, are any of those people here?!",
        "Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? I’ll-I’ll fill her\n        ice trays.",
        "Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. (She manages to climb completely\n        inside and the window slams shut.) Oh, shhh!",
        "No! No!! It’s me! It’s me! I-I didn’t want to make any noise!",
        "I’m sorry.",
        "I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.",
        "Umm, okay, okay, look. I took this picture from your fridge.\n        Okay, because I know that this is my Father. Yeah, this is\n        Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him.\n        Now, look I deserve to know where I came from. All right? So\n        if you can help me find my Father then you should! Otherwise,\n        you’re just mean! (pause) So, just tell me the truth!",
        "My Father is Chuck Magioni?",
        "Oh.",
        "Heh?",
        "(screaming, angrily) ...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!! (applause) (happily) Thank you, thanks.",
        "Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?",
        "Yeah, I actually don’t know...",
        "Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on, you! (goes over and picks up the cat) Come on. Crazy. (looks into the cat’s eyes) Oh my God.",
        "Nothing. Nothing.",
        "I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.",
        "No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.",
        "No Dr. Skeptismo! I’m sure. First of all, okay, there’s the feeling. (Chandler shrugs) Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. (Rachel nods her head in unsure agreement) My Mother’s favourite fish is Orange Roughy... (Joey thinks he understands, but then nods that he has no clue.) Cats....like....fish! (Ross and Rachel are totally lost) (to the cat) Hi, Mommy. (Rachel covers her mouth, in an “Oh my God.” gesture) Oh, I haven’t seen this smile in 17 years!",
        "(is struggling with the cat) Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.",
        "Well, I’m not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there’s y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she’s worried that y'know, she’s gonna, she’s gonna be replaced. (to the cat, in a funny voice) Well, that’s not gonna happen is it? Noo. (gets up) Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.",
        "Well, I’m returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word. (goes into Monica’s room)",
        "(entering, with Julio) Hi. (sits down in the chair)",
        "Yeah?",
        "So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.",
        "I just feel so, uhh.....",
        "Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo.",
        "Yeah? (sees Ross) Hi!",
        "Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?",
        "(she turns around and puts the cat on the entertainment center) Ross, how many parents have you lost?",
        "Okay, then you don’t know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I’m wrong, who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive.",
        "Okay.",
        "I think she would like that.",
        "Thank you. We both forgive you.",
        "Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you’re welcome to come back anytime.",
        "Come on, Mom, I’ll take you home.",
        "How come?",
        "Okay, I didn’t hear that.",
        "Wow! And hey, it’s cool if you’re a lesbian! (Gives her a thumbs up)",
        "That’s weird.",
        "Your nails.",
        "Oh, no, I meant that it’s weird that you only have nine now.",
        "Okay, don’t panic. I’m gonna go to the store, I’m gonna get you another set of nails, no one’s gonna know, and you’re gonna look great. (She runs over to get her coat.) Oh! Oh, it’s ‘cause they’re gonna eat—that’s the problem.",
        "And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!",
        "I don’t get it.",
        "Op, the ruined quiches are ready.",
        "Hey!",
        "This used to be your room? (She nods ‘Yes’) Wow! You must’ve been in really good shape as a kid.",
        "Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.",
        "No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we’ll call that pulling a Monica.",
        "Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A’s, his parents would say, \"Yeah, he pulled a Monica.\" Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, \"Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica.\" Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, \"Yeah, that one’s outta here.\" Though some things don’t change.",
        "Wow! My breasts are really strong. (She goes and joins Monica.)",
        "They’re not even touching the lasagna!",
        "Oh, they love your casserole.",
        "It’s hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.",
        "Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. (They both look at her) (to Monica) She doesn’t know we switched it. (Monica nods her head ‘No.’)",
        "Oh.",
        "Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.",
        "Hey! New wallet, huh?",
        "Oh please, somebody tell me I don’t have to go to work today!",
        "Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I’m not allowed to charge for.",
        "Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it’s against my oath as a masseuse.",
        "No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one’s actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.",
        "No, I can handle it. No, I’m a professional. (She starts to leave)",
        "I don’t what your talking about. (Laughs nervously and continues to leaqve)",
        "Because it’s Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!",
        "These old things.",
        "You mean the—Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.",
        "Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y’know, real (lifts up the towel) nice and tight. So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.",
        "Oh. (She goes to work, and her head slowly drops out of view.)",
        "No!",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.",
        "On the touchy.",
        "No, I know! I-I’m sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.",
        "(thinking to herself) Okay, baseball. Rick, playing baseball. Okay, slides into second, maybe even his pants come down a little… Oh no—wait no, no! No! Okay, all right, sandwiches, sandwiches. Umm, okay, on a plate, maybe Rick’s pants come down a little. No! No! Okay, Chandler! Okay Chandler, ooh, that’s working.",
        "(thinking to herself) Chandler’s knees. Chandler’s… ankles. Chandler’s ankle hair. (notices the clock) Oh no. (to Rick) Okay, you’re all set.",
        "Yeah! In… really long hour world.",
        "Ugh, okay, I have an enormous crush on you. But because you’re a client, I can’t ask you out, even though you give me y’know, the feeling.",
        "Really?!",
        "What?",
        "(laughs) Okay, quit down. (they start to kiss again)",
        "Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isn’t what it looks like, ‘cause Rick is my ahh, husband.",
        "Yes, I will tell her.",
        "Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.",
        "It’s so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!",
        "I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next, y’know? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then these policemen, thought I was a whore too. It’s been a really bad day, whore wise.",
        "Yeah, they thought I was a whore.",
        "Great! Thank you very much.",
        "Thank you.",
        "(entering) Oh.",
        "(in a nasally voice, from her cold) But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. (She puts her shoe on the table, and it's horribly decorated) Pretty, huh? (Sneezes)",
        "Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People. (Starts to sing) Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you? (Stops singing) This chick sounds good. (Singing) Smelly cat, smelly--(stops singing) Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.",
        "(singing, drunk) My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey.",
        "It's fun, God I love how sexy I am. (Coughs really loudly.)",
        "Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.",
        "Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.",
        "So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.",
        "Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that \"Woo-hoo\" thing.",
        "Hey.",
        "Hi.",
        "Wow, cute one!",
        "Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour. Hey, (clears her voice and in her normal voice) you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. Ooh, (tries to sing) My sticky shoes--eww! Eww! I lost my sexy phlegm!",
        "Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common.",
        "What?!",
        "Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!",
        "You mean you stole it! (Monica sneezes again) Don't cover your mouth when you do that!",
        "(entering) Hi! It's me. And soup. (to Rachel) Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket.",
        "(to Monica) Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water.",
        "(picking up Monica's used Kleenex and putting some in her pocket.) Sure.",
        "But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.",
        "It's okay. How's the soup?",
        "(singing) Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street. Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats. (to Gunther) Does it even work without my sexy voice?",
        "Gunther, kiss me.",
        "(singing) And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.",
        "Oh my God, they took my idea!",
        "Yeah! Okay, here you go. (rolls her back to Rachel)",
        "Oh my God, are you guys okay?",
        "Umm, oh, about three months.",
        "Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?",
        "Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this\n        age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right\n        food, and lot’s and lot’s of love.",
        "(to Pete) Wow! That’s exciting, you went to Japan, made up a\n        woman.",
        "I’m just saying, this woman, I mean she’s fictitious. No?",
        "‘Cause you’re still into Monica. So you told her there was\n        somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so ‘cause\n        you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe\n        something might happen, and...",
        "Yeah, no, I’m fairly intuitive and psychic. It’s a substantial\n        gift.",
        "Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?",
        "No I’m serious. I mean I’m intuitive, but my memory sucks.",
        "Hey! ",
        "What?",
        "Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.",
        "Ooh, I have to tell you something.",
        "But I can’t tell you.",
        "Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn’t\n        tell, and I swore to like all my gods.",
        "No.",
        "No.",
        "No, but let’s come back to that later!",
        "Noo!",
        "Oh, wait, wait. Clogs, or claws?",
        "No.",
        "No.",
        "(Shaking her head yes) No!",
        "I don’t know! (frantically points at Monica)",
        "I can’t!!",
        "I, but you’re so close! No!",
        "Oh, just go. You’re never gonna get it!",
        "Hey what are you guys looking at?",
        "Yeah, come to papa.",
        "Oo! Is it for my birthday present?",
        "Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?",
        "'Kay.",
        "Yeah, and what a great way to say, \"I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!\"",
        "It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!",
        "Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican... (Monica looks almost puzzled) ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?",
        "There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!",
        "Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.",
        "Yes, but I'm doing this.",
        "Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?",
        "Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.",
        "Mon! I'm so happy for you!",
        "I'll have one, please. Plus my money.",
        "Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank.",
        "Yes. Did you settle the bill?",
        "Oh, look what we almost left. (Picks up a coffee maker)",
        "Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!",
        "But Mon, you have to get our money!",
        "I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?",
        "Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, \"that massage wasn't long enough, or, \"I don't recognize any of those songs,\" or, you know, \"these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!\"",
        "Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.",
        "She seems fine now.",
        "You didn't get the money, did you?",
        "No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough! (Phoebe goes into the living room.) Hey, widow?",
        "Okay, Widow!",
        "Excuse me. Excuse me! (Mrs. Bukart stops singing) Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.",
        "Good. (Phoebe and Mrs. Burkart go into the other room, leaving Monica with everyone staring at her.)",
        "Uh... yay!",
        "Yeah. I'm a hard ass.",
        "Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!",
        "Okay!",
        "Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties!",
        "Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?",
        "(singing) \"Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease…\" Darn it! Now, I don’t know who to get to the next verse.",
        "Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about ‘bah-bah-bha-bhan?’",
        "Oh yeah, that’s right, the keyboards, huh?",
        "I wanna hear \"The Sound.\"",
        "Come on, play that funky music white boy.",
        "Wow, it was so—wow!",
        "What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it’s just, it’s so different from the stuff you usually hear.",
        "(pushing Monica back onto the couch) It’s so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!",
        "Oh no, I’m not playing tonight.",
        "I can’t follow Ross! It’d be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.",
        "Oh my God, he’s not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!",
        "You guys. You suck too. (She hugs them both.)",
        "Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!",
        "Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Yeah, I-I can’t—I mean y’know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just—I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I…",
        "Oh no. No-no-no, don’t do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.",
        "Does Joey know?",
        "I think maybe, yeah.",
        "Yeah! No, that’s right. And I thought it was a really good idea.",
        "Oh my God, he’s lost it. He’s totally lost it.",
        "After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.",
        "Okay!",
        "Okayyyyy, open up!",
        "Yeah, it’s for our catering business!",
        "No, we’re gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette.",
        "And also, we don’t know what to do with this. (She turns on a switch and the girl’s nipples light up.)",
        "Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.",
        "How could you say yes, what about our catering business?",
        "Oh, in that case—(hops up and down in joy)—Yay! (Monica looks confused) That was me hopping on board.",
        "Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?",
        "Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.",
        "Oh, okay! (reading) \"Would I go back to Allesandro’s? Sure, but I’d have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head.\" (to Monica) Wow! You really laid into this place.",
        "Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.",
        "No-no, it’s okay. But are we sure we don’t want the waterbed?",
        "Yeah, all right. (starts to leave)",
        "Bye!",
        "(on intercom) Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go.",
        "Hey, Monica!",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Yeah.",
        "I don’t know, it would totally depend on her coloring and… (realizes) You got the job!!",
        "Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.",
        "But we’ve only had one job.",
        "Yeah! What are you saying?",
        "What?",
        "You’re the cook! With out you it’s just me driving up to people’s houses with empty trays and asking for money!",
        "For what? I can’t believe this! I gotta get out of here. (leaves)",
        "Okay, I’m hearing.",
        "What?!",
        "I wa-I wa-I wa…",
        "Monica!",
        "No.",
        "No.",
        "Really?! Are you sure?",
        "Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let’s plan the wedding reception. (She grabs the notebook which Monica used for her ideas and starts flipping page after page after page after page after page to find a blank one.) Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. (pause) Y’know what, I want you to take the chef job.",
        "Yeah. That’s what you really want. Yeah, I don’t want to be the reason you’re unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don’t want to be the reason I’m unhappy.",
        "Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.",
        "Hey!",
        "You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn’t be living in an apartment.",
        "All right. I’m gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I’m ready to have Frank and Alice’s embryo transferred into my uterus.",
        "Oh, they’re just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.",
        "Okay everyone, think thick.",
        "Hi! Wish me luck!",
        "Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.",
        "Embryossss? As in, \"More than one?\"",
        "Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?",
        "That’s it! 25 percent? That means that’s it’s like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!",
        "Okay, well y’know what, don’t worry you guys, ‘cause I’m-I’m gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.",
        "Whoa!! That—okay, that’s a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. (to Dr. Zane) So, well okay, so is there—is maybe is there something that I can do y’know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?",
        "Wow! You guys really don’t know anything!",
        "Hello, tiny embryos. Well, I’m-I’m Phoebe Buffay, hi! I’m-I’m-I’m hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months. You should know, that we’re doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, you’ve been there! Umm, y’know they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on. Okay, and-and I promise that I’ll keep you safe and warm until you’re ready to have them take you home, so… Oh! And also, umm next time you see me, I’m screaming, don’t worry, that’s what’s supposed to happen.",
        "Uh-huh. (To the embryos) Good luck.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Umm, yeah, uh-huh, they’re implanted.",
        "Well, freaked. ‘Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alice’s like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket.",
        "All right, I’m gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now.",
        "Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body’s always been a little faster than Western medicine.",
        "Nope, not knocked up yet.",
        "Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, I’m gonna do whatever I can to help this so, I’m just gonna y’know, lie it your chair, (She climbs into the chair and drapes her feet over the back of the chair.) Y'know? Yeah, good, I’m let gravity y’know, do its jobs.",
        "(singing) \"Are you in there little fetus?\n                             In nine will you come great us?\n                             I will buy you some Adidas.\"",
        "Oh. Oh.",
        "All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, y’know just remember that it’s still really early, okay so, if it says that I’m not pregnant, that doesn’t mean that I’m not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so I don’t go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.",
        "Great. (Goes to take the test.)",
        "You guys! You guys! You’re gonna have a baby! They’re gonna have a baby!",
        "Okay, but this can’t be good for the baby.",

        "All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.",
        "Yeah, I can see where I’d be your best shot but, no. I’m sorry, but I think it’s twisted.",

        "You’re kidding! And he plays rugby?! That’s so funny. (Realises) Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.",
        "(to the player) Hi.",
        "Whoa! (The player leaves and to Joey) I kinda liked it.",
        "No offence but, y’know sometimes it’s hard to understand you, y’know with the accent, so…",

        "Now, are you sure you don’t want to go see a doctor?",

        "See? I’m doing it. I am totally doing it. (Suddenly it stops working.) I lost it.",
        "I-I can’t find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I’m telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake—ooh! Cake! (Chandler shrugs, and Phoebe grimaces.) No.",

        "(she smells his head) No!",
        "Yes. Yes. Yes. I can’t believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can’t eat meat!",
        "(angered by the rubbing) Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y’know? And I got nauseous.",
        "Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.",
        "That’s sweat. You throw up all morning, you’ll have that glow too.",
        "Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?",
        "Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?",
        "Oooh, yeah. You’re a genius.",
        "Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!",
        "Y’know it doesn’t matter how much I’m craving it. Y’know why I’m never gonna eat meat? Because it’s murder, cold blooded murder.",
        "I can’t help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.",
        "Yeah, totally!",
        "Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I’m gonna eat like, y’know millions of cows.",
        "What?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Joey, I can’t believe you would do that for me.",
        "Pastrami.",
        "Okay.",
        "Six months.",
        "Not if I get there first.",
        "(holding a lure) So now, what is this now?",
        "(laughs and picks up another lure) And this?",
        "(laughs harder) You make it so funny.",
        "Hey!",
        "I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.",
        "Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.",
        "Don’t you just love the way they talk?!",
        "Ohh!",
        "It kicked! I think the baby kicked!",
        "Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.",
        "Why?",
        "Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?",
        "(going over to comfort her) Aww, Pheebs.",
        "That’s short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!",
        "Shhh!! Please! What’s he saying?",
        "What? Oh my God!",
        "Well, look, why don’t you just, why don’t you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.",
        "Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!",
        "Y’know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!",
        "I’m sorry. (Goes and hugs him)",
        "Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, ‘cause I’m pregnant.",
        "Ha-ha, it’s not my baby, ha-ha-ha! (He leaves.)",
        "(doing the same) I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.",
        "Come on! Look where you are!!",
        "Remember, a virgin for me please.",
        "Well, if you think it will help.",
        "You should! How is she?",
        "Who, Josh?",
        "Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, y’know what, you were right, you were right. We really weren’t great at being guys, but you know why? Because we’re girls.",
        "And do you know what girls are really good at?",
        "No, listening! Sit! Y’know, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk.",
        "Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh! What is that? What is that?",
        "Hey—ooh so, how was Vermont?",
        "I-I wanna be with her, (points to the stripper next to her) I like her.",
        "(entering, carrying her massage table) Hi!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Ohh, I’m getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. Y’know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table. (She goes over and stands in front of the TV.)",
        "You mean like a doctor?",
        "Ohh! (She moves.) Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN today.",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Why don’t take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I’ll hold onto your card, okay?",
        "Three? You guys were worried I wouldn’t even have one!",
        "Well, yeah.",
        "Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months I’m going to have three full grown babies just walkin’ around inside me?! Oh! Oh! And it’s gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!",
        "What do you know?!",
        "Ooh! Hi!",
        "Oh well, okay, hey, y’know how when you’re umm, you’re walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, \"Oh, that’s nice?\"",
        "Okay, yeah well, good news, you’re going to have three babies.",
        "Oh God, I’m so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.",
        "No, no maybe ‘cause it’s harder to raise them, and the added expense, and…",
        "No, back to happy. Back to happy!",
        "No you can’t quit college! No! You’re in college? Really?",
        "You can’t give up on your dream.",
        "Hey.",
        "Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you (Points to Chandler) about, ‘cause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.",
        "(entering carrying a case) Ooh, good, you’re hear! Okay.",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh this, well I’m glad you asked. (She opens the case and removes a knife and an soda can.) Now, don’t you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? (She efficiently cuts it in half.) Ahh! Now, I know what you’re thinking…",
        "No!",
        "No!",
        "No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.",
        "My Saturn dealership.",
        "Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I’m gonna open up my own massage place and Frank’s gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn’t have to quit school!",
        "I’m telling it! I’m telling it!",
        "Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I’ve got?",
        "No! Think about it, it’s a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it’s…",
        "The name was my favourite part!",
        "YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That’s not good.",
        "Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that’s better than Relaxi Cab.",
        "Oh, that is better.",
        "(On the phone, in New York) Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller’s personal physician, Dr. Philange.",
        "Yeah, I’ve discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women’s names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.",
        "No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!",
        "Hello?",
        "Hi, so what happened?",
        "Yeah, I know, but I don’t think that means anything.",
        "Hey!",
        "(To Joey) You ate meat! (Joey is shocked) (To Chandler and Monica) You had s*x! (They’re shocked.)",
        "I know you didn’t, I was talking about Monica.",
        "This pregnancy is throwing me all off.",
        "Oh, me too!",
        "Oh right, maybe I’ll just go home.",
        "Hey!",
        "(not amused) Ha-ha. (She sits down on the couch.) No, it’s just I’m so pregnant that I—my guitar doesn’t fit anymore. So I thought ‘til I’m not, I’m just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!",
        "Listen. Listen. (She starts to play and sing.) Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?",
        "I know! I know, and I’ve only been playing for like an hour!",
        "Hey! What are you doing here?",
        "Oh, well, don’t tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.",
        "Wow! That’s so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.",
        "Hi!",
        "Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book (Holds up a book) and found nothing! I want a name that’s really like, y’know strong and confident, y’know? Like-like Exxon.",
        "No, I’m-I’m not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with \"The.\"",
        "Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. (They both stare at her.) But, all right, I don’t—maybe I’ll just name him The Hulk.",
        "God, Susan is so fun!",
        "Yeah, I definitely. I don’t like the name Ross.",
        "No! No! I-I meant for the baby!",
        "Well, it’s just y’know that something like this would never to like The Hulk, y’know…",
        "So, I decided I’m definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.",
        "Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it’s like y’know, Chanoey?",
        "All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?",
        "Umm, Gene.",
        "Bye, Gene.",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Wow, Carol really messed you up!",
        "Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant. (They all look at her.) All right, so I don’t know what sycophant means, but the rest is right.",
        "All right, all right, so up until ‘92-93 he was very trusting, then ’94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!",
        "Yeah. The ’92 Ross wouldn’t.",
        "Drum roll.",
        "You’re actually going through with this?",
        "You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact—yes, (To Joey) I’m, I’m sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I’m-I’m, I’m gonna, I’m gonna name the baby Chandler.",
        "Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!",
        "Okay!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yay!",
        "Yay—oh—yay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!",
        "Ooh, uh… (She grabs her coat and runs out.)",
        "Okay, bye!",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, the Olympics.",
        "I still cannot believe you’re engaged! (Ross looks at her) Just ‘cause its happening so fast; not ‘cause you’re such a loser.",
        "Already?!",
        "Yeah, but y’know, about have of these are gonna end up getting divorced.",
        "You’re the most beautiful bride I’ve ever seen.",
        "No-no, let me in!",
        "Yeah!",
        "No, you have to let me in right now!!",
        "Yes!",
        "Yeah.",
        "(catching it) I got it! Mine! (They both hug)",
        "Thank you!",
        "Okay! (Gets into position) Okay, ready?",
        "Okay. (Phoebe turns and throws it on the couch.)",
        "I’m not gonna right to you! That’s not real!",
        "Yeah, I think we are.",
        "Well, at least you didn’t rent yours from a store called, \"It’s Not Too Late.\"",
        "Me too.",
        "Me too.",
        "Okay.",
        "Yay!",
        "I hate my regular clothes now! Y’know? I look down and-and I know that this isn’t gonna be the most special day of my life.",
        "I guess.",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Oh, you’re such a cheater!",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, how’d that happen?",
        "What is that?",
        "Oh, how did it go?",
        "What did he say?",
        "Yeah, maybe.",
        "Any luck?",
        "(looks at Monica) Hey, y’know what might cheer you up?",
        "No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!",
        "Not after this!",
        "(to the nurse) Hi.",
        "Hi, yeah, hi! I'm umm, Phoebe Buffay, and I have babies coming out of me.",
        "Not yet. Umm, I heard they really hurt, do they hurt?",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Oh no, none of them are the father. The father is my brother.",
        "Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me!",
        "(standing up) Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice. (As she is talking Joey is sticking the camera under her skirt.) And then my mom wants to know-(notices Joey)-Joey, what are you doing?!",
        "What?!",
        "Oh my God, she's so stupid!",
        "That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your v*g1n*!",
        "All right--Ooh! Oh dead God, save me!",
        "I'm having my first contraction!",
        "Ooh, it's not bad.",
        "Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!",
        "No-no-no! We haven't started yet. Where's Alice?",
        "Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either--Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! (Checks under the blanket.) Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.",
        "Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder.",
        "Hey.",
        "It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!",
        "(interrupting) What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!",
        "Hi! And you're going into what grade?",
        "(interrupting) Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor.",
        "Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!",
        "They are. Why?",
        "Happy birthday!",
        "I know, it is.",
        "Can I tell you a little secret?",
        "I want to keep one. (Giggles in excitement.)",
        "Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!",
        "Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?",
        "Oh, just ask him!",
        "I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out!",
        "You're right.",
        "Tell him it's for you.",
        "(To Rachel) So did you ask him?",
        "Well, I'm kinda on a clock here.",
        "Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.",
        "Hi!",
        "Okay, doctor says any minute now.",
        "Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.",
        "Oo, this is a big one. Eww! Arghhhh!!",
        "What is that?",
        "Oh my God!",
        "I already had a baby. Leave me alone.",
        "Which one do you have?",
        "But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know…",
        "Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies.",
        "So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little high fives! (Imitates the high fives.) Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! (One of the babies begins to cry.) Well, if you're gonna cry. (She starts crying.)",
        "I know.",
        "Yeah. You won't be able to take it.",
        "They're gonna call her Chandler.",
        "Works on you.",
        "(entering, wearing Santa pants) Hello!",
        "Excuse me.",
        "Oh, yeah! You like ‘em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!",
        "What?",
        "Nuh-uh! They’re maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby names. (Pulls out a sheet of paper which lists who’s been naughty and who’s been nice.) See, these names are good, and these names are bad. (Finally, she figures it out.) Ohh.",
        "I don’t know! How are the-the-the-the, y’know—You’re clothes aren’t funny.",
        "Boy! I didn’t see that coming!",
        "That’s too hard. Too hard!",
        "Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?",
        "Or you could end up with everything.",
        "Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?",
        "Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh—oh, I have a game!",
        "This is great!",
        "Oh, well, it doesn’t have a name—oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it doesn’t have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?",
        "Good! Good! Five points!",
        "All right, Joey, same question.",
        "Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy, leafy.",
        "Oh, I have cards!",
        "Yeah! Here! (She grabs a deck out of her purse) Oh no, these are the trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.",
        "What make you think I can?! (Shields her eyes from it.)",
        "I don’t know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! (She fans out the trick deck.) Ah-ha!",
        "(opening the door) I had nothing to do with it. (Closes the door.) (Opens the door.) Okay, it was my idea, but I don’t feel good about it.",
        "That’s so funny to think if you’d just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.",
        "Okay, scarf’s done. (It’s not really a scarf, it’s just a bunch of yarn that Phoebe has tied together. Just then, Ross and Emily enter dragging with them Joey and Chandler.)",
        "Hey!",
        "What? Oh, are you pregnant too?!",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this driver…",
        "What?",
        "Oh. Ha-ha-ha. All right, anyway…",
        "Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat--I don't want to talk about it.",
        "So you still hadn't heard from Emily?",
        "London is stupid! Stupid!",
        "Oh… No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "(Grabs the pictures) Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me. (She picks up a magic marker and draws herself in. Monica can't watch.)",
        "No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.",
        "Well, it felt French.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!",
        "(excited) Central…(not so excited) Park!",
        "That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? \"Well, it's right by my house, all right!\"",
        "That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.",
        "Okay, woo! Hi.",
        "Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?",
        "Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!",
        "Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for rolling bones!",
        "All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun! (She starts out the door.)",
        "Wait, wait, remember when my water broke? (They all high-five again.)",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "What-what’s up?",
        "Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y’know you can die. And, you would die!",
        "So you guys’ll stay here and hang out with me?",
        "[singing] I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...",
        "Oooh look! Isn’t this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine!",
        "Hey! Hey, did you get your invitation to Ross’s wedding?",
        "I’m so jealous you’re all going! I can’t believe I never knew that you can’t fly in your third trimester!",
        "Remembered what?",
        "Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.",
        "See, he's her lobster.",
        "Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.",
        "Okay, okay, but Rachel’s gonna be here too, can’t I just ask her this stuff?",
        "Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your wedding, but I don’t—can’t get up.",
        "Great! Yeah, could you bring me the newspaper?",
        "Oh, have a great wedding!",
        "Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!",
        "Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, it’s on the counter in your apartment.",
        "(laughs) Thank you.",
        "Thank you. (She pats him on his head.)",
        "Oh, do you need a hug? You don’t have to bring me anything!",
        "Oh. Oh.",
        "Oh, no. Oh, nothing.",
        "Okay, I have a wedgie.",
        "So-so, what do you want for lunch?",
        "Yeah, I do. What’s the matter?",
        "Eh, don’t be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married…",
        "Yeah!",
        "Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.",
        "We thought you knew!",
        "Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!",
        "Oh no, Ross doesn’t know anything.",
        "Well, because we thought you knew!! It’s so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, \"Hey, you like things clean.\"",
        "Hey!",
        "So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?",
        "Well, I think I can help you get over him.",
        "Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.",
        "And a small piece of chocolate.",
        "And a glass of tepid water. (She gathers up all of these things.)",
        "Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn’t feel like getting up. Okay, I’m gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you’re going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.",
        "Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he’s such a great guy. Here. (Hands her the picture, Rachel grabs it out of her hand.) Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you’re with Ross okay and imagine that you’re kissing him. And you’re-you’re running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it’s some kind of grease, it’s—uck! Hah?",
        "Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let’s try some uh, aversion therapy.",
        "Okay?",
        "So uh, now look at the picture…",
        "All right, and umm… (She grabs the picture and smacks her in the head.)",
        "Okay, how do you feel now?",
        "Hello.",
        "Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the—that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say ‘hi!’ but then I figured, he doesn’t care if he looks like you.",
        "Ohh, they’re having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn’t been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?",
        "So you’re not homesick yet?",
        "All right, the seven of us miss you.",
        "Y’know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies…",
        "Ooh, the pizza guy’s here!",
        "Yeah. But y’know we were thinking about you, y’know we ordered the Joey Special.",
        "Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Yeah, it’s in the guys’ apartment under the sink. Why?",
        "What?! What do you mean you’re going to London?",
        "I—Rachel, you can’t go! Ross loves Emily!",
        "That’s not why you’re going! You’re going because you hope he’s gonna say, \"Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy.\"",
        "No! Because he’s in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you’re just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y’know, it’s too late! You missed you’re chance! I’m sorry, I know this must be really hard, it’s over.",
        "I do! I do! I do! (Chases her into the hall, but Rachel doesn’t stop.) I do! (Gives up.) Ugh, like I can really chase you. I’m carrying a litter.",
        "Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily’s Parents’ house.",
        "(In a British accent) This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it’s not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?",
        "No no no, I’ll be nice, I swear!!!   Could you just give me the number for where they are?",
        "Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if you don’t give me that number then I’m going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.",
        "Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass.",
        "(Looking relieved. She puts down the phone.) Oh thank god. Oh, you changed your mind. Oh, look I know you probably want to be alone, and you don’t want to talk about it, that’s fine. I just want you to know, I think you are doing the right thing and...",
        "(Trying to get up.) Wait!! Where are you going?! What are you doing?! No!! Wait!! (Not able to get up.) God!! Why am I always pregnant when she does that?!",
        "Oh, hi, Mrs. Waltham. I need to speak with ether one of the best men, or Ross’s sister Monica.",
        "Oh, I’m Phoebe Buffay. I’m one of Ross’s best friends.",
        "Yeah, um, I can’t fly. I’m having my brother’s babies.",
        "No..umm, could I talk to one of them? It’s very very important.",
        "Ohh! Okay, I’m going to have to kick her ass too.",
        "(Angrily.) Hey, were the hell have you been?!",
        "I don’t want to hear about her!!",
        "No! No, we have an emergency. Okay? Rachel’s coming to London.",
        "No it’s not great. No, she’s coming to tell Ross that she loves him.",
        "I KNOW THAT!!! You have to stop her!! She’s going to ruin the wedding!!",
        "All right, so, okay...",
        "Okay, so I’m done my part, okay. It’s your responsibility now, okay. The burden is off me, right?",
        "So tell me about this girl?",
        "Mrs. Waltham. Hi. It’s Phoebe again.",
        "Yea. Can I please, please, please talk to one of the best men? This is going to be the last time I promise.",
        "Did you stop Rachel?",
        "So nothing got ruined?",
        "Oh that’s so great! Ohh, so what’s going on now?",
        "No!! wait, wait, wait!! Oh please, hold it up so I can listen. (Joey looks at Ross and holds the phone above Ross’s shoulder.)",
        "(angrily) That’s like the tenth time I’ve peed since I’ve been here!",
        "Yeah, oh I’m sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya, it’s a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I’m so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, ‘cause—Oh! I’m pregnant!",
        "(starting to cry) Thank you so much.",
        "I haven’t really had any yet.",
        "(to her babies) Stop it!",
        "One of the babies is kicking.",
        "It’s not kicking me, it’s kicking one of the other babies. Oh (looks down her dress)! Don’t make me come in there!",
        "Hey!! Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!! (Joey walks back in, scared.)",
        "I can’t believe I’m gonna have a party! This is so great! (Really excited) A party! (Really, really excited) Yay!! (Suddenly, she starts crying and Rachel moves to comfort her.) I don’t know why.",
        "What the hell is this?! What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can’t use for another two months?! This sucks! All right, what’s my next present?!",
        "Hi, guys.",
        "I-I wanted to apologise if I—y’know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y’know it’s just the hormones, y’know.",
        "Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet. (She goes to hug them and they both flinch, thinking that Phoebe is about to attack them.)",
        "Good. Y’know—no-no, okay, it’s-it feels like everything’s been about me lately, so what’s happening with you?",
        "Oh!",
        "Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.",
        "Well, let’s see, it’s not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y’know a bunch of y’know high school crap that nobody really gives y’know…",
        "Alrighty, here come the water works. (Rachel starts crying harder.)",
        "(sips it) It’s so good. (Monica and Rachel breath a sigh of relief.) Oh, thanks.",
        "(sets the cup down) Oh! (Grabs her stomach in pain.)",
        "Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.",
        "Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one.",
        "No. It’s all right; it’s probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.",
        "Well, do you see any babies?",
        "Okay, I guess. I mean… I don’t know, it’s just, I guess I know it’s going to be over soon.",
        "I know. It’s just y’know usually when you’re, when you’re done with the pregnant thing, y’know, then you get to do the mom thing. I’m gonna be y’know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.",
        "Okay that’s even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it’s just that now that they’re in me it’s like, it’s like I know them y’know, I mean-I mean, it’s just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.",
        "Yeah, okay.",
        "Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!",
        "They are gonna love me.",
        "Thanks you guys! Again.",
        "You’re the best. Thanks. Oh!",
        "Just kidding. Ahh!",
        "Got cha again, you guys are so easy."
