        "Which one was Pete Carney?",
        "Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-\"I-win\"-guy. [imitating] \"I win! I win!\" I went out with the guy for two months--I didn't get to win once.",

        "I can't believe you. You still haven't told that girl she doesn't have a job yet?",
        "Congratulations, I think you've found the world's thinnest argument.",

        "Come on, you gotta talk to Joey.",
        "Rachel, what are you doing? It's freezing out here. Would you come back inside?",
        "Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or ankle or something.",
        "All right. Name, address...Ok, in case of emergency call?",
        "Really?",
        "Oh, that is so sweet. Oh gosh. I love you. Insurance?",
        "Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that. Monica: You don't have insurance?",
        "I have no idea, but x-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.",
        "There's not much we can do.",
        "No no no no no no no no no.",

        "Ok. Ok. I hate this.",
        "Hi. Um, I'm gonna need a new set of these forms.",
        "I am really an idiot. You see, I was filling out my friend's forms, and instead of putting her information, I put mine.",

        "Hi.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Uh, you left out the stupid part.",

        "A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, ok?",
        "I said we are not going to do it. Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.",
        "What?",
        "What?",
        "Yeah, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar. Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but hey, that's me. Why don't you try the hummus?",
        "(laughing) Oh, God, I am so spoiled. That's it.",
        "I used to wet my bed.",
        "We both do that.",
        "Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. Listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um, there's something that I've been meaning to tell you. Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Drestin and I had s*x on your bed.",

        "We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.",
        "Thank you.",

        "Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!",
        "How'd it go?",
        "Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?",
        "Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex- best friend?",
        "THAT's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!",
        "(RE WINDOW) Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!",
        "Great, now he's waving back.",

        "Why not?",
        "I could do that.",
        "Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.",
        "STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?",
        "Well, what's the part?",
        "(TRYING NOT TO LAUGH) Oh my God.",
        "Alright, alright, alright... ",
        "For what?",
        "Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.",
        "He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!",
        "I warned you...",
        "Oh, you got the whole night, huh?",
        "Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that. ",
        "Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?",
        "Maybe this wasn't your shot.",
        "I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys. ",
        "(DETERMINED) Uh-huh!",
        "Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever. (GOES TO HER ROOM)",
        "(HUMS FOR A WHILE, THEN GIVES UP.) (VOICEOVER) If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help! (BURIES HER HEAD IN HER PILLOW) ",
        "What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "(TAKING DRINK FROM JOEY) Are you through with that?",
        "Whose little ball of paper is this?!",
        "Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.",
        "That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. ",
        "What? ",
        "Easy Rach, we'll find it. (TO ALL) Won't we!",
        "You didn't.",
        "I gave you one job! (EXAMINING THE LASAGNE THROUGH THE GLASS DISH)",
        "(PUTS DOWN THE lASAGNE) I just... can't do it.",
        "Wow. That is not a happy hi.",
        "W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...",
        "What does she mean by 'involved'?",
        "Curry.",
        "I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?",
        "No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.",
        "Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?",
        "I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.",
        "What's that supposed to mean?",
        "No it's not. ",
        "(TRYING TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (DIGS HER ELBOW INTO HIS HAND) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?",
        "Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (TO ROSS) -I'd want yours.",
        "Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.",
        "(WELLING UP) Mm-hmm.",
        "No.",
        "Am not!",
        "(PUSHES HIM AND STARTS TO CRY) Oh shut up!",
        "I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross.",
        "Guys, you got your hair cut.",
        "This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?",
        "It's just an expression.",
        "Phoebes, you know what I'm thinking?",
        "No, although now that's what I'm thinking.",
        "Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?",
        "Why not?",
        "No you're not.",
        "Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.",
        "Please, just a little bit off the back.",
        "Rachel, how did this happen?",
        "Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.",
        "My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't--but this is about your horrible mistake.",
        "You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.",
        "I promise.",
        "What? I didn't say anything.",
        "I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.",
        "How who wears it?",
        "Demi Moore is not a he.",
        "That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.",
        "Oh my god!",
        "She's the actress who was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost.",
        "I KNOW!",
        "Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.",
        "Thank you. My hair is very amused.",
        "Originally written by Adam Chase and Ira Ungerleider\nTranscribed by Mindy Mattingly Phillips [mmatting@indiana.edu].\nOk, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist.",
        "Ok, um, I'll go with you.",
        "It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?",
        "But I'm--",
        "Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.",
        "You're welcome.",
        "Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.",
        "We were shopping, and we had lunch.",
        "You had a salad.",
        "Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju-- Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye.",
        "Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.",
        "Hey, where is everybody?",
        "Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.",
        "You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.",
        "That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.",
        "Judy.",
        "Julie.",
        "Jody.",
        "Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.",
        "Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.",
        "Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out.",
        "That is not true!",
        "Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?",
        "Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanna, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.",
        "I don't know what else to say.",
        "I feel terrible, I really do.",
        "Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?",
        "It's that terrible?",
        "Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.",
        "Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?",
        "I'd do anything for you.",
        "So how was Joan?",
        "How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?",
        "Hello, Mr. Heckles.",
        "We're not doing anything.",
        "Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.",
        "Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.",
        "Mr. Heckles.",
        "That's terrible.",
        "What can we do for you?",
        "Well, what about his family?",
        "I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!",
        "Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.",
        "It doesn't go with any of my stuff.",
        "You don't have any stuff.",
        "No.",
        "Mmmmm.",
        "Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?",
        "Hide the Lamp.",
        "Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?",
        "Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.",
        "Phoebe, tell her!",
        "Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.",
        "You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.",
        "You are not a freak. You're a guy.",
        "Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.",
        "No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.",
        "You made it!",
        "No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.",
        "That's fine.",
        "Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.",
        "Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.",
        "They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?",
        "Oh, you are so great! [kisses him] Thank you!",
        "They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.",
        "Ross, I thought you were over this.",
        "What?",
        "Oh, honey.",
        "God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.",
        "[entering] All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.",
        "Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.",
        "Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.",
        "Um, you guys, you know when I said before, \"thank you, but I don't really need your help\"?",
        "Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.",
        "If you want.",
        "All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.",
        "I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.",
        "All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!",
        "Joey, speed it up!",
        "Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?",
        "[to Ross] All right, you!",
        "All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called \"pigs in Ross\". All right, ball the melon.",
        "Hi.",
        "It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.[everyone groans]",
        "You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.",
        "So we're back on?",
        "You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.",
        "Would you look at them?",
        "Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?",
        "All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.",
        "Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't cry. Why is he still crying?",
        "Maye it's me.",
        "There's my little boy. (Ben starts crying again)",
        "He hates me. My nephew hates me.",
        "What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?",
        "That is so funny. Let me see that. (throws the ball out the window)",
        "Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi-- ",
        "No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special. ",
        "No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and--oh my god.",
        "Oh my god.",
        "Is your tongue swelling up?",
        "All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital.",
        "Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot.",
        "Jacket now.",
        "Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.",
        "My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally. ",
        "That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?",
        "Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!",
        "Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts.",
        "That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.",
        "Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?",
        "Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?",
        "No. But I remember people telling me about it.",
        "Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.",
        "That was you?",
        "Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he's not crying.",
        "I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.",
        "Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?",
        "Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.",
        "Well, didn't you?",
        "I can't believe you didn't tell me.",
        "What have I not told you?",
        "Wait a minute, who told you? [turns to Chandler who's looking sheepish] You are dead meat.",
        "Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple.",
        "That is wild.",
        "Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.",
        "I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.",
        "Hell, I wanna see Joey.",
        "All I say is, she better get the job.",
        "You know, it still smells like monkey in there.",
        "Rachel, that's all we do.",
        "Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? [Rachel gives her a look from hell] That's fine.",
        "Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.",
        "Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.",
        "Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.",
        "Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.",
        "Cute.",
        "Ross, that is gorgeous!",
        "Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy.",
        "Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.",
        "Oh, wait a minute honey.",
        "Wow.",
        "Hi.",
        "I hope she's OK.",
        "How do you know exactly what she's going through?",
        "Just some stuff for the party.",
        "You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?",
        "Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.",
        "For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive.",
        "Rach, get the heat. [Rachel holds up her hand with wet fingernail polish] Ross, could you turn the heat down please?",
        "Ross, the heat!",
        "Well put it back.",
        "Here, let me try.",
        "Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.",
        "No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.",
        "[carrying an ice cube tray] Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. Alright.",
        "Really? I'm perfectly comfortable. [one of the guest opens the refrigerator] Hey, hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next. [she opens the refrigerator and leans into it]",
        "No, I will not cave.",
        "Ross.",
        "[to Ross] Looks like he's playin' baseball.",
        "Whatever.",
        "So, wait, you really did like my cookies?",
        "Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier.",
        "Honey, I'm sorry.",
        "(enters) Oh my god.",
        "I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.",
        "Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.",
        "Who is also in charge of purchasing.",
        "Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.",
        "Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!",
        "Oh, sorry.",
        "Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.",
        "Oh, thank you!",
        "All right, what's goin' on?",
        "Ok.",
        "If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.",
        "All of us.",
        "I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.",
        "Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.",
        "Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.",
        "It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.",
        "Like?",
        "Charity?",
        "Guys, we bought the tickets.",
        "Well, I guess now we can't go.",
        "You know what? You're right.",
        "All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.",
        "You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.",
        "You know, the guys are probably having a great time.",
        "That was amazing!",
        "Do I know you?",
        "Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?",
        "You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.",
        "Uh, wait, backstage?",
        "Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?",
        "Uh, good.",
        "No, I just, I fell down.",
        "You know, a party, or--",
        "That would be the work of a Blowfish.",
        "It's work.",
        "(on phone) Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.",
        "Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.",
        "Great.",
        "Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing.",
        "A salad? Really I, I could do something a little more complicated if you like.",
        "You got it.",
        "Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.",
        "Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.",
        "That's your call.",
        "Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.",
        "They'r alright.",
        "No really, they're OK.",
        "Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.",
        "I'm outa here. [Monica leaves]",
        "Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me.",
        "Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent.",
        "No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.",
        "Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few debloons.",
        "Hi.",
        "So, what's this.",
        "Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?",
        "Oh, God forbid.",
        "Where have you been?",
        "No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.",
        "Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it.",
        "Because they made me.",
        "Anything larger back there?",
        "You have dinosaur checks?",
        "Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful.",
        "Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then.",
        "Hey, you got me, put it in.",
        "You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.",
        "Over here dad. [he pans over and we see a torso taking up the whole screen]",
        "Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.",
        "Oh, you look so great.",
        "Oops.",
        "Shoot, I think I got mayonaise on you.",
        "Oh, dad, turn it off.",
        "Dad, it is not. What's with the red light?",
        "Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper.",
        "I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.",

        "Yes but my mom got me this job.",
        "Really Phoebs? Because, you know, you'd have to be an actual waitress. This can't be like your 'I can be a bear cub' thing.",
        "Sorry we're late.",
        "Dr. Burke, it, it's me.",
        "Thank you. This is my friend Phoebe. She's gonna be helping me tonight.",

        "I am not.",
        "Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up.",
        "Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.",
        "Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.",

        "I just can't stand you being here all the time.",
        "Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?",
        "Ross, I hated you when we were kids.",
        "Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.",
        "Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way.",
        "Duh-huh!",
        "Now I love you. And not just 'cause I have to.",

        "Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.",
        "Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.",

        "Are we still on that?",
        "I'm a twinkie.",
        "Oh, this is so hard.",
        "Maybe we should just tell your parents first.",
        "God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.",
        "Alright.",
        "You remember that video I found of mom and dad?",

        "Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.",
        "Well, uh, he's a doctor.",
        "No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him. [she puts her arm around Richard]",
        "Mom, it's OK.",
        "Dad, I'm the twinkie.",
        "Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . .",
        "Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.",
        "Yes.",
        "Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier.",
        "Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.",

        "Oh. Well did you get it? Let me see.",
        "No he went out to get pizza.",
        "That's great.",
        "Yes.",

        "We, we just wanna see the end.",
        "Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place.",
        "Well, maybe you don't need them.",
        "Shut up, I'm happy.",
        "Not a lot, Phoebe's kidding, Phoebe's crazy.",
        "Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.",
        "Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with.",
        "Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?",
        "Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth. [goes in the bathroom]",
        "Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.",
        "Well yeah.",
        "You really ok with it?",
        "Oh, yay. Ok about that two.",
        "Well, it just seems like a really small number.",
        "And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?",
        "But you've only slept with two people.",

        "It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow.",
        "Why?",
        "Wait, he's not here yet.",
        "Alright.",
        "Did they just kill off Joey?",
        "And some of us really have to pee.",

        "I don't want a beer.",
        "[seeing TV] Hey, I went up.",

        "Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too.",
        "Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks?",
        "But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs.",

        "I'm just easing you in.",
        "Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.",

        "Right now, Joey and Chandler's, go now.",
        "Just go.",
        "Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out.",
        "Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you hear them click. [she demonstrates, Gunther starts to walk to the door] Gunther, where're you going?",
        "No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker.",
        "Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny.",
        "What? [she runs over to where Phoebe is, Phoebe signals for Gunther to go] I don't see anything.",
        "Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament.",
        "You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you doing here?",
        "Phoebe.",

        "Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.",
        "Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.",
        "Ok. [Richard walks in] Hey, why don't you ask Richard?",
        "I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?",
        "C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.",
        "So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag. [walks off]",
        "Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay.",
        "Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him?",
        "So'd you guys have fun?",
        "Really?",
        "So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?",
        "Ross.",
        "Look. [they look at Joey in the kitchen with a cigar in his mouth, looking at his reflection in a spatula] Joey, do you know we can see you from here?",
        "You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.",
        "So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?",
        "You're meeting Richard?",
        "Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys.",
        "With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?",
        "So you watched the movies huh?",
        "Alright, you wanna feel better?",
        "Ok, here, watch this.",
        "So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.",
        "There's a game?",
        "Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.",
        "Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.",
        "Oh, then go Vassar.",
        "Ok, then just go.",
        "Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.",
        "It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?",
        "I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.",
        "Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.",
        "Did you like it?",
        "Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?",
        "[enters] Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table.",
        "[grabs the other two bars on Richard's side and scores] Score! Now can we go?",
        "Um-hmm.",
        "Nighty-nite.",
        "[her and Richard return to her place] So are you ok?",
        "Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.",
        "Yeah, well they suck too.",
        "Hey.",
        "A mirror?",
        "Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.",
        "Cache? Jaunty?",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh my God, it was incredible.",
        "Rachel you have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It's about how women need to become more empowered.",
        "It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard.",
        "No.",
        "Yes. But all the other ones.",
        "Isn't it.",
        "Hey.",

        "Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.",
        "One hour? You are such a leaf blower.",
        "We didn't order cake.",
        "You're right.",
        "We're good.",
        "Are you sure this time?",
        "There is no alley behind Macy's.",
        "So on this road trip, did you guys win any money?",
        "Nice.",
        "Then what's the problem?",
        "What, forget it!",
        "Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.",
        "Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him. (Rachel glares at her, and she retreats to safety between Richard's legs)",
        "Woo-hoo, stuud!",
        "Woo-hoo, geeek!",
        "Please!",
        "Bye sweetie, (kisses him) I love you.",
        "What are you talking about? What wedding?",
        "Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'",
        "Could not be more terrified.",
        "(holding up a blanket) Where's Benny? (drops the blanket) There he is! (does it again) Where's Benny, there he is.",
        "Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure. ",
        "Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?",
        "Yeah, am I in it?",
        "Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.",
        "Keep talkin'.",
        "Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?",
        "Not a basset, a bassinet.",
        "Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.",
        "(entering) Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs.",
        "So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.",
        "Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about.",
        "Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.",
        "You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I...(sees two little girls dancing together) I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do.",
        "You'll do what?",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Really?",
        "You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'",
        "Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.",
        "I know you do. Me too. (pause) So what now?",
        "God, look what I found in the drain.",
        "It's some of Richard's hair! (holds it close to Ross) What do I do with this?",
        "It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh! (drops it in Ross's cereal)",
        "God, what is wrong with me.",
        "I need to get some Richard.",
        "I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!",
        "What are you the memory woman?",
        "Hi.",
        "Oh, they-they sent me home.",
        "Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.",
        "I know I do.",
        "Richard's living room, drinking wine.",
        "I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.",
        "All right, I'll try not to.",
        "Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?",
        "I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.",
        "Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.",
        "(crying) So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.",
        "Uh, huh. (to Ross) Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away. (Rachel, Monica, and Phoebe leave)",
        "Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?",
        "I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad?",
        "What makes you think that I might not be okay?",
        "Oh.",
        "I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?",
        "No, I really, really do.",
        "Really!",
        "You're not just saying that are you?",
        "Was he crying?",
        "Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?",
        "I think so.",
        "Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, (turns sideways\n        on the couch) so that you can bunny bump against my back.",
        "See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.",
        "Oh, now you want a pad.",
        "(entering from her bedroom) I gotta go to work. Has anybody\n        seen my left boob?",
        "There it is. Joey, what are you doing?",
        "What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to\n        feel something, you have to run away?",
        "Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant\n        until you get us to break up with you.",
        "Uff.",
        "That is never good.",
        "Ohh! (both grab there stomachs in pain)",
        "Welcome to our side of the tunnel.",
        "You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you\n        gotta switch to low-fat.",
        "Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just\n        need some damage control.",
        "Nooo!",
        "She has to know that your not ready.",
        "My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.",
        "You know what, everything's gonna be okay. ",
        "If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.",
        "Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you\n        just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.",
        "Aw, it's soo unfair. (they both start digging into the 'good'\n        ice cream)",
        "What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big\n        deal. You used to dress up like a woman.",
        "Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.",
        "The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.",
        "How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea. ",
        "Wasn't there a little song?",
        "(singing) 'I am Bea.'",
        "'I drink tea.'",
        "'....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '",
        "A-ha!!! (they all start laughing, as Ross hides in the\n        bathroom)",
        "(entering the shot) Ross!!! (starts to wipe up the\n              spill)",
        "(entering from bedroom) Okay, I’ll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I’m sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.",
        "Oh, then it must’ve been you. Bye. (leaves)",
        "(entering) Ross (who has his foot on the coffee table), foot on the floor or come over no more!",
        "What?",
        "Hi.",
        "Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.",
        "Chris says they’re closing down the bar.",
        "Yeah, apparently they’re turning it into some kinda coffee place.",
        "Got me.",
        "Hey, did you pick a roommate?",
        "Is it the Italian guy?",
        "He’s so cute.",
        "Oh look, the pool table’s free. Rack ‘em up. I’ll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.",
        "Oh my God, I went to high school with her. (to Rachel) Rachel! Hi!",
        "Oh my God, you can’t even see where the Titanic hit it.",
        "Awww, just like you always wanted. Congratulations",
        "Aww, not right now.",
        "I know.",
        "So, I’ll get-get back to my friend.",
        "Oh, that’d be great.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Bye! (to Chandler) Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my life.",
        "What are you doing with the lamp?",
        "Oh, well don’t take it to the same place you took the stereo, ‘cause they’ve had that thing for over a week.",
        "Hi, again.",
        "Thank you soo, much.",
        "You want some help with that?",
        "Whoa! Are you okay?",
        "It’s the heat. (has her hand on his chest, and then pulls it away) And-and the humidity.",
        "Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?",
        "Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.",
        "This place is really my Grandmother’s. (Joey starts to take off all of his clothes, while Monica gets the glasses and pours the lemonade.) I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I’m 87 year old woman, who’s afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?",
        "(turning around) Okay, here’s your pen1s!",
        "Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!",
        "So?!",
        "Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!",
        "I don’t believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have s*x?",
        "It’s okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.",
        "Pheebs?",
        "Where’s your bed?",
        "What?",
        "What are you talking about?",
        "Everybody knows!",
        "Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.",
        "What?!?!",
        "You can spill. In the sink.",
        "I love you, too.",
        "What? I’m just said.",
        "Hey.",
        "(all depressed) Help yourself.",
        "Phoebe moved out.",
        "I don’t understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don’t have a boyfriend?",
        "Well, I think so.",
        "I know, it is isn’t it?",
        "Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.",
        "Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.",
        "I know. Thanks. (Chandler leaves)",
        "Hey, are you okay?",
        "No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.",
        "So, Chandler, who’s on your list?",
        "First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.",
        "Hey! Where ‘ya headin’ in those pants? 1982?",
        "Why, what’s wrong with my bathroom floor?",
        "I highly doubt that. (they both go to the bathroom)",
        "I can’t live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?",
        "That’s a little more than I wanted to see.",
        "I can’t leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.",
        "You know that’s nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!",
        "What kind of karate is that?",
        "So how’s it going with you guys?",
        "Oh honey, we’re close now but you-you wouldn’t believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and....(Phoebe shakes her head like she doesn’t understand) That’s where the waistband actually goes over your head.",
        "Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.",
        "Oh, how do you play the shadow game?",
        "I just asked you.",
        "No, that is what the game is.",
        "What’s the matter?",
        "He’s retiling my floor. (they both run to the bathroom)",
        "Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.",
        "It’s beautiful! It’s like the first bathroom floor there ever was. (Chandler tries to go to the bathroom) Whoa! Are you going in there for?",
        "And who laminated it?",
        "Are you serious? (they all look) Oh my God.",
        "Why? ‘Cause otherwise you’d go for it?",
        "Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?",
        "Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?",
        "I was always Joanne.",
        "I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. (they all stare at her) And I’m appalled for you by the way.",
        "What’s the part?",
        "Not at these prices.",
        "(lying down on a mattress) Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.",
        "(sees the bed) What’s this?",
        "This is not the bed I ordered!",
        "Phoebe!",
        "Why is this car in my bedroom?",
        "When did I sign for it?",
        "Did you make brownies today?",
        "(to Phoebe) Quick, take off your dress, he won’t notice the bed.",
        "Sometimes I have bad dreams. (starts to break down, and Phoebe offers her, her hand to comfort her.)",
        "Joey, you’re this guy’s teacher. I mean how could you do this?",
        "Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I’m the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.",
        "You broke a little girl’s leg?!!",
        "Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...",
        "All right, I’ll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that’s it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. (to Ross) Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?",
        "No.",
        "Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t do this.",
        "(she reaches out for it and stops) Oh God! I gotta go! (runs out)",
        "(comes up and starts looking through Ross’s cookie supply) Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?",
        "What?",
        "No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it’s no big deal, all right, I’m-I’m cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!",
        "(covers her neck) Oh God! (runs to the bathroom)",
        "Christmas cookie?",
        "(entering) Hey, guys. I’m here to pick out my Christmas tree.",
        "Is this the one that I threw out last year?",
        "Oh honey, is that ‘cause your Mom died around Christmas?",
        "Oh. (turns and looks at Joey, who gives a ‘way-to-go’ thumbs up and smile.)",
        "(jumping up from behind the couch) Merry Christmas!!",
        "Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.",
        "Every year.",
        "Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the ‘Geller Bowl.’",
        "Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind’ve competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross’s nose.",
        "To score the winning touchdown, by the way.",
        "(to Chandler and Joey) I won the game.",
        "Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it’s been twelve years.",
        "(shouting) Once!!",
        "Okay. Let’s bring it in.",
        "Well, why don’t we just bunny up.",
        "Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.",
        "Phoebe.",
        "All right people listen, I’ve got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.",
        "Huddle up.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay, Phoebe you know what you’re doing right?",
        "Okay, Joey’s gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block.",
        "Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you’re doing?",
        "Break.",
        "Score!! 7 to nothing!",
        "Losers walk!",
        "Come on guys! Let’s go! Come on, it’s second down.",
        "No it’s not, it’s second.",
        "Wow, what?",
        "Pulling what? It’s second down.",
        "I heard that!",
        "All right, come on guys, let’s go! Tie score, and we’re runnin’ out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike! (the timer sounds as Monica throws the ball to Phoebe.)",
        "Run, Phoebe, run!",
        "After the snap!",
        "Does so count!",
        "Y'know what, that’s fine, maybe you haven’t grown up, but I have.",
        "Dead leg!! (kicks him in the thigh.)",
        "No! Listen, I’m not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can’t blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let’s just call this, tie score and it’s halftime.",
        "Y'know what? I’ll think you’ll play.",
        "Because the winner gets this!",
        "When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.",
        "No it’s not! You want it, you’re gonna have to win it!",
        "Come on Phoebe, let’s go! Come on, it’s time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.",
        "All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?",
        "All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I’ll take care of the rest.",
        "Break!",
        "Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don’t see that everyday, do ya?",
        "What?! I just touched him and he went over.",
        "Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!",
        "You’re so pathetic! Why can’t you just accept it, we’re winning because I’m better than you.",
        "Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I’ll prove it to you, okay. I’ll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I’ll still win the game.",
        "Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.",
        "Come on Rach, come on. Let’s see what’s it like to be on a winning team for a change.",
        "All right then.",
        "Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.",
        "We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you’re making out...",
        "Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let’s kill ‘um!",
        "All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we’re down by two points. Two points.... (she gets interrupted by the guys, who are doing a slow-motion high five.) Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.",
        "Honey, there’s a reason.",
        "All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I’ll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.",
        "Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!",
        "No! I’m not okay!",
        "Come on! Come on! Hurry! We’re running out of time! Huddle up!",
        "All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.",
        "Break!",
        "Let go! I’m a tiny little woman!!",
        "Ow!!",
        "Let go!",
        "No!",
        "I don’t know. I guess the other people just don’t care enough.",
        "Let go!",
        "You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.",
        "So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?",
        "Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you\n        wanna show Rachel? Come here. (takes Ben) We’re gonna do\n        something fun. Okay. (throws Ben up in the air a little bit\n        and catches him) Weee!! (moves into the living room and does it\n        again) Weee!! (starts to walk back into the kitchen as she\n        does it again, and hits Ben’s head on that wooden beam across\n        the ceiling.)",
        "(to Ben) Who’s so brave, you’re so brave, yes you are,\n        you’re so brave.",
        "He’s not gonna say anything, because we’re not gonna tell\n        him.",
        "No we’re not.",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!",
        "Okay, we’re gonna need a distraction.",
        "I got it!",
        "The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take\n        him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that\n        makes him go, (high pitched) rweee!!",
        "A hat! Yes! We need a hat.",
        "Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?",
        "Because he’ll know what to do? (Rachel comes out of her\n        room with a bear that’s dressed in a rain suit.) Oh my God,\n        you’re a genius!",
        "Give it. Give it.",
        "It just makes more sense as an ensemble.",
        "Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.",
        "Sure, we have no money, go ahead.",
        "Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?",
        "Did he just say ‘Monica bang’?",
        "Oh my God! He’s gonna rat me out!",
        "Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that,\n        now. It’s no big deal, it’s not even worth mentioning, you see\n        we all do it all the time. See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben.\n        (goes over and starts hitting her head on the post) Ow, Monica\n        bang! (does it again) Everybody bang. (repeats) Ben bang.\n        (repeats) Rachel bang. (repeats) Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn’t\n        that fun?",
        "You okay?",
        "Okay, Ben, I won’t tell your daddy that you had ice cream\n        for dinner, if you don’t tell about our little bonking incident.",
        "Oh that’s right, that’s what I’d sound like if I exploded.",
        "All right, we should call somebody.",
        "How are we gonna do that? There’s no way.",
        "Yeah.",
        "No. Why?",
        "Really?!",
        "Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!! (runs into the bedroom)",
        "(coming out of the bedroom) You jerk! You know how\n        much I love that kid! (starts to chase Ross around the living\n        room)",
        "And yet, we’re still poking him.",
        "Um-mm.",
        "Wow. Joey, (sarcastically) how do you do it?",
        "He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.",
        "I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.",
        "All right, be my guest.",
        "Honey, what’s the matter?",
        "It’s Joey’s birthday.",
        "Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.",
        "I know honey, I’m sorry.",
        "(gives her a look) Gee, I don’t know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!",
        "Hey Gunther. Hi. (to Phoebe) I mean you’re going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?",
        "I know, he’s too charming, but if you two start going out, then it’s just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.",
        "Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?",
        "(to Chandler) Stick out your tongue.",
        "Oh my!!",
        "How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey’s sisters.",
        "Hi.",
        "Isn’t that great?",
        "Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, ‘Hummina-hummina-hummina.’ (walks away)",
        "How ya feelin’?",
        "What is the worse part?",
        "Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he’s actually going to kill you dead.",
        "I mean, was it Gina?",
        "No, no, no, that’s Dina.",
        "That was me.",
        "That’s okay.",
        "Y'know which one was she again?",
        "No honey, I’m sorry, but the weekend’s not over yet.",
        "I guess they’re back from their date.",
        "Oh my God!",
        "I am good. I finished my book.",
        "I don’t remember. Do you wanna take a walk?",
        "Wait a minute, why don’t you just call Mark. (they both look up in shock) I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you’ve got to make stuff happen.",
        "(to Ross) Honey, it’s not pushy, he gave her his home number.",
        "Yay!",
        "Oh, that is amazing!",
        "What?",
        "Are you crazy?!",
        "What?! Ross y'know this isn’t even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you’re right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?",
        "I mean don’t you trust her?",
        "Then get over yourself! Grow up!",
        "So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?",
        "Yeah, I do know.",
        "Y'know if it’s any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you. (Rachel nods in agreement)",
        "Please, I'm not going for anything.",
        "Would you please go?",
        "Look Julio, someone left their book here.",
        "Oh yeah, what are you reading?",
        "Have I read it? (pause) No, are you enjoying it?",
        "Your a poet and don't know it. (she turns away and makes a face like 'I can't believe I just said that.')",
        "Oh, then you do know it. (pause) So um what kind of things do you write about?",
        "Mine? (points to her lower lip) Right here?",
        "How would that go? (they kiss) Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.",
        "(entering) Hi!",
        "It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem.",
        "Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out. (hands them the poem)",
        "Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs?",
        "Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work. (tries to take the poem)",
        "All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh-ho, look what I got Julio.",
        "Yeah, just like the one in the poem.",
        "What do you mean?",
        "(to Julio) So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?",
        "Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.",
        "You don't even know me...",
        "What?",
        "I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...",
        "(sarcastically) Oh yeah.",
        "(to clerk) Hi.",
        "Six? I just had it for one night. It’s three.",
        "Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you’re gonna have to help me out here, ‘cause I only have three.",
        "Oh my God. Richard? (turns around) Hi!",
        "Wow! Your lip went bald. (Richard pays the clerk) Hey, thanks.",
        "Right.",
        "What?",
        "(removes them) That’s because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it’s static cling. Or maybe it’s just that God knew I’d be running into you and saw an opportunity.",
        "It’s good to see you too.",
        "You see that guy? He’s in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he’s going straight to the p0rn.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Me too.",
        "Oh, um, I don’t know if that’s a good idea.",
        "No, I just I think that it’s too soon.",
        "(entering from her bedroom) Morning.",
        "Yeah well, I ran into Richard.",
        "Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.",
        "Tomorrow night.",
        "It’s not a date, okay. I’m just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.",
        "We’re not gonna have s*x! Okay, nothing’s changed here. He still doesn’t want children and I still do, so that’s why we’re just gonna be friends.",
        "You say ‘Thank you very much,’ and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we’re gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we’re gonna start squishing the tomatoes.",
        "You touch people’s eyeballs every day and this feels weird.",
        "Oops.",
        "Gotta keep squishing.",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.",
        "Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it (does so) and it should umm, be.....",
        "Umm, you’ve got some on your pants.",
        "So, how’d the lasagne go over? (listens) Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. (listens) Yeah, I’ve been thinking a lot about you too. (listens) I know. It’s hard this whole platonic thing. (listens) It’s a word!",
        "Yeah, I do think it’s better this way. (listens) Yeah, we’re being smart. (gets up to answer the door) (listens) Yes, I’m sure.(she opens the door and it’s Richard)",
        "I’ll call you back. (starts kissing him)",
        "So we can be friends who sleep together.",
        "Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?",
        "Oh.",
        "No! (pushes him) No!",
        "‘Cause if you do that means you’d be cancelling it for me, and we’re just friends.",
        "Hi.",
        "You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, (opens her coat revealing a large burn mark over her left breast.) in a grill fire.",
        "What are you smiling at?",
        "Yeah, right.",
        "I love this friend thing!",
        "Ow!",
        "Oh my God! Oh my God! (She frantically tries to clean up the bedroom as Richard starts the tour.)",
        "(still hiding under the blankets) So um, who was she?",
        "(still hiding under the blankets) Did you like her? And I’m just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.",
        "(gets up) Okay, y'know what, I’m not fine, I’m not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... (pause) Y'know what, what if we’re friends who don’t see other people?",
        "Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.",
        "That’s not true, you don’t have a moustache.",
        "Y'know what, I’ve got to walk out of here right now, ‘cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don’t think I could do it again.",
        "How ‘bout one last game of racquetball?",
        "Watch the thorns!",
        "(to Phoebe) Look at you. All jealous.",
        "Yeah, sure.",
        "Y'know those are a delicacy in India.",
        "Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?",
        "Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.",
        "Hey.",
        "No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.",
        "Yeah, Ginger something.",
        "No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, (singing) ‘the movie star.’",
        "Well, what did you do?",
        "Y'know what, don’t tell us. We’ll just wait until Chandler gets home, (to Phoebe) because it’ll be more fun that way.",
        "You gave her food poisoning!?",
        "Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?",
        "Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.",
        "Phoebe why don’t you just call her? You obviously want to.",
        "Well, don’t ‘cha wanna?",
        "Okay, well I do know you.",
        "Well so?",
        "(entering) Hi!",
        "Oh, can I borrow this? (points to his milk) My milk’s gone bad.",
        "So umm, how was your date with Ginger?",
        "Sounds like she’s got the ah, whole package.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Sorry, Pheebs.",
        "We’d love too.",
        "Wow! It’s like Rachel in High School.",
        "Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!",
        "I won’t give you anything, but you’ll owe me 2.95.",
        "Why? (in a motherlike tone) Do you have a report due?",
        "Okay, let’s start with the free messages outside the UN.",
        "Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what country is this guy from?",
        "Where’s that?",
        "I don’t have an atlas.",
        "Oh, but wait I do have a globe.",
        "Hold on.",
        "‘Kay, here you go. (Hands her this tiny little globe.)",
        "It’s a globe and, a pencil sharpener.",
        "Oh, no thanks.",
        "Well, if you don’t have anything to copy, why are you going down there?",
        "Wow! It’s small.",
        "So you had fun, huh?",
        "No.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh no, she’s still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her.",
        "All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. (holds up a notepad) Call Rachel.",
        "Oh that’s my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. (to Phoebe) She’s fancy.",
        "Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?",
        "Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? (Mischa laughs) Why? What did I say?",
        "Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.",
        "I’m also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.",
        "Well, I was having a conversation.",
        "What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?",
        "Oh. (to Phoebe) Can I have a tissue?",
        "Hey, the man’s dog just died.",
        "It will be my pleasure. (to Phoebe) My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can’t even say coupons. (they leave)",
        "Hey.",
        "How’s the big anniversary dinner?",
        "Ohhh, nice.",
        "What?! (She accidentally starts the blender without the lid on it and fruit flies everywhere.)",
        "That’s okay, this is more important than fruit (pause) (angrily) on my ceiling! You broke up?!",
        "Oh no!!",
        "Rachel, you and Mark?!",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh, there’s banana on it.",
        "So then you know? (Phoebe nods her head)",
        "Oh, good. Thanks.",
        "Okay, all right don’t judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....",
        "Yes! Have you seen it?",
        "I know!!",
        "Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!",
        "Did that!",
        "Okay. (Does so.) Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!",
        "No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.",
        "That’s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don’t believe me, please, by my guest.",
        "Now, are you glad we didn’t start with the bikini strips?",
        "Ow!",
        "Ow!! Ow!!",
        "It’s okay, it’s okay.",
        "We were just waxing our legs.",
        "That’s right.",
        "What?",
        "(going over to listen at the door) Rachel said everything was okay.",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Oh!! (hits Chandler and Joey in the head) You guys knew about this and you didn’t tell us?!",
        "(stopping him) What, what are you doing? You can’t go out there.",
        "Because they’ll know we’ve been listening.",
        "What if they don’t?",
        "Hey. It’s three in the morning. They don’t know that I’ve come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.",
        "Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?",
        "No! Rachel is meeting us here.",
        "It’s never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.",
        "(seeing her) Okay, let’s go!! Let’s hit the road!!",
        "Let’s get the show on it!",
        "Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it’s sooo close.",
        "We’re sorry honey.",
        "Very bad.",
        "Chandler!!",
        "Weren’t you nine?!",
        "We’re really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.",
        "Noo! I’ll stay. He’s my brother.",
        "No! We’re gonna have fun. We can make fudge!",
        "Why? Do you think he’s still mad at us?",
        "No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.",
        "What?",
        "Ow!",
        "(getting out) No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.",
        "So, if you’re parents hadn’t got divorced, you’d be able to answer a question like a normal person?",
        "What?!",
        "Please!!",
        "These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it’s gotta be Rachel.",
        "All right then, your bra would still be big.",
        "Chandler!!",
        "Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?",
        "Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.",
        "So the going for help went well?",
        "Then why are you smoking?",
        "(running over to stop Rachel) Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let’s stock up. (takes her into the bathroom)",
        "(reading the sign) What’s ‘pleh’?",
        "Huh. What’s doofus spelled backwards?",
        "I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?",
        "Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?",
        "Here we go again.",
        "(shyly) I don’t know.",
        "What I said was, was that I understood. Joey’s the one who agreed with you!",
        "All right, we’ll call you when we get back.",
        "Wow, you’re really crazy about her, huh?",
        "Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!",
        "Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! (Ross gives her a look) (to Ross) And I’m sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?",
        "I get the dollhouse!",
        "Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.",
        "Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.",
        "Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper’s a little faded, that’s okay. Carpet’s a little loose. Hardwood floors!!",
        "I know!!!",
        "Okay.",
        "What’s this?",
        "Not one that can pee on the roof.",
        "I don’t want a ghost.",
        "Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that’s it, that’s it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They’re not the right size, they’re not Victorian, and they just don’t go.",
        "It’s very interesting, Phoebe.",
        "Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!",
        "You’re kidding?! That’s great!",
        "Oh my.",
        "Come on Rach, when a guy says he’s going to call, it doesn’t mean he’s going to call. Hasn’t it ever happened to you?",
        "Hmm, bite me.",
        "(from the bathroom) I’m in the shower!",
        "Oh, that’s okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.",
        "(runs over to her) I tried to reach you at work. There’s....been a fire.",
        "Well, the giraffe’s okay. And so is the pirate.",
        "(to Joey) What’s so funny?",
        "Oh. (she laughs)",
        "Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don’t you think he’s a little young to get married?",
        "So, um, how-how did you guys meet?",
        "And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I’ve only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.",
        "(to a customer) Pete, can I get you something else?",
        "Haven’t you and I covered that topic?",
        "Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.",
        "I mean really, think about it.",
        "Nah, he doesn’t do anything for me.",
        "Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids…. (realises) All right, I get your point.",
        "Hey.",
        "Uh, yeah.",
        "Here you go.",
        "As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I’d call him.",
        "That’s Bill Clinton.",
        "Oh my God! That’s Pete! But why is Bill huggin’ Pete?",
        "I’m not gonna go out with him.",
        "Or incredibly offensive.",
        "What the hell is this? (holding up the check)",
        "Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?",
        "You’re supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what’s-what’s the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?",
        "What?!",
        "Okay, umm, you’re a loon.",
        "I don’t know.",
        "‘Cause I don’t want to encourage this kind of behaviour.",
        "Guys, please, I’m just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?",
        "I know!!",
        "(opening the door) (to Pete) Hey!",
        "And that’s why, I’m not inviting you in for a drink. (starts to leave) Bye.",
        "(in the hallway) So, where do you want to go?",
        "Oh, that’s sounds great.",
        "Oh come on, it’s only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?",
        "Why, how much is that?",
        "Oh, this is so great.",
        "All right then. (He leans in to kiss her goodnight, but she quickly kisses him on the cheek and pats his shoulder.) Bye.",
        "Hello, people who do not live here.",
        "I gave you a key for emergencies!",
        "He’s great! I mean we have such a good time together! He’s so funny, and sooo sweet, and I’m not attracted to him at all!!",
        "Noo!! It’s driving me crazy. I mean every other way he’s like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.",
        "Two.",
        "Absolutely! (He goes to kiss her, but she stops him and rubs his head and says...) Now get out of here you!! (Pete leaves) (to the gang) Okay, I’m running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there’s no future? Either they’re too old, or they’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me, and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something’s wrong with me?!",
        "Sure.",
        "(looks around) Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I’m gonna say, midget rodeo.",
        "Okay. Umm, y'know, I don’t think, I don’t think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.",
        "So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn’t the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I’m just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?",
        "I so wanna be attracted to you.",
        "I’m sorry.",
        "It’s not?",
        "Well, um, look I-I don’t want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn’t attracted too.",
        "Hey, Rach, how was work?",
        "By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.",
        "Something wrong?",
        "Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.",
        "That was you?!",
        "Hi! Hey, Pete you’re back! Hey, check this out. (She starts to\n        skate over to him)",
        "Wow! You’re a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a\n        piece of paper. So how was you’re trip?",
        "Oh, what’d ya bring me?! (She opens the gift) Awww, hotel\n        toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent\n        collection. You want some coffee?",
        "(popping back up) Regular or decaf?",
        "Okay. (hands him a cup)",
        "So what did you do today Pete?",
        "What?! Oh.(She turns around quickly and falls)",
        "Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?",
        "I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy\n        Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica’s Bakery. I mean I would kill\n        for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows\n        I paid my dues. (She removes her fake breasts) But Pete’s just\n        doing this because he has a crush on me.",
        "Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him?\n        I-I-I-I can’t. I couldn’t even accept a necklace from Stu\n        Vincent in the seventh grade.",
        "Oh, please. ",
        "What? Honey.",
        "Oh God, I’m so sorry.",
        "Oh God!",
        "Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel\n        Sanders. (Ross starts to leave) Ross! Ross! I’m kidding!",
        "What-what was it you were gonna tell us? ",
        "Okay. Here’s the thing.",
        "I can’t do it. I’m sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have\n        these feelings for me....",
        "Huh?",
        "Oh?",
        "Oh, that’s great! I mean I’m-I’m sorry, but I’m so happy for\n        you. And now I can work for you!",
        "Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! (she rolls over and\n        kisses him on the cheek) All right, y'know what? I’m just\n        gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!",
        "Okay. (she gets ready to go) Can you give me a little push?",
        "(rolling towards the office) I’m quitting!! Woo-hoo! (She\n        rolls through a doorway and out of sight. We then hear a big\n        crash, and see Monica roll past the door the other way.) I’m\n        okay!! I’m all right!!",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey, guess what I’m doing tonight.",
        "I’m checking out the restaurant with Pete.",
        "I know.",
        "What?",
        "Okay, but wouldn’t it be easier if you had to tell me\n        something that you could tell me.",
        "Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?",
        "Does it have to do with Joey?",
        "Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he\n        keeps by his bed?",
        "Does it involve travel?",
        "Does it involve clogs?",
        "Clogs.",
        "Claws?!",
        "Okay, so it doesn’t involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey.\n        But, what about Pete?",
        "What is it?! What about Pete?",
        "Okay, I feel like I’m talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe\n        would you just tell me!",
        "Okay, I gotta go. (gets up)",
        "Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete’s computer\n        company?",
        "I don’t believe this! Wow, look at this refridgerator! It’s\n        gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I’d be cold, but\n        I’m always cold. Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I\n        love spider burners.",
        "Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much. (runs over and hugs\n        him)",
        "Did you just smell my hair?",
        "Oh God.",
        "You still have feelings for me don’t you?",
        "Pete.",
        "No, it’s not bad. It’s not bad at all. It’s-it’s really nice.",
        "You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with\n        being the one who hurts you. That’s why I can’t take this job.",
        "And well, we probably shouldn’t see each other anymore. I’m\n        sorry.",
        "Okay, bye. ",
        "All right shut up for a second and let me just see something.\n        (She kisses him back on the lips) Oh, wow! (They then hug and\n        kiss, very passionately.)",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "You’re not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over...",
        "So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm...",
        "(Robin is speaking loudly again) I...",
        "Forget it. (they all turn and listen to Billy and Robin)",
        "(pause) I have no idea.",
        "He didn’t ask me to marry him.",
        "He wanted to tell me he’s gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.",
        "I don’t know exactly. It’s-it’s sorta like wrestling.",
        "Yeah, but without the costumes.",
        "So you can like, bite, and pull people’s hair and stuff?",
        "What’s fish hooking?",
        "I gotta tell ya, I think it’s okay to be that guy.",
        "Okay, can we please go eat?",
        "(to Chandler) Anything but stew.",
        "(entering) Hi!",
        "Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don’t want you to get hurt, ‘cause I kinda like you.",
        "Promise me you’ll be careful.",
        "Hey, are we still on for tonight?",
        "Okay, good, ‘cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...",
        "How ‘bout just a boom?",
        "God Ross, what is that?",
        "I love you, Pete!!!",
        "(going up to the ring) Pete! Pete!! That guy’s pretty huge!",
        "Hey! (she sits down next to him) It’s me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.",
        "I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.",
        "Well, you’re not gonna get going are you?",
        "Well, no. But...",
        "That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!",
        "You didn’t know that already?",
        "Okay, just get a lot better. (pause) Fast.",
        "Yeah. That-that was the problem.",
        "(joining them) Hey.",
        "Oh, about five minutes. Right now they’re interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.",
        "Four, please. (Ross looks at her) I’m really nervous. (Ross gives her the four dogs) Thank you. (she grabs four buns, and heads back inside)",
        "Please tell me you’re stopping now.",
        "You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!",
        "Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!",
        "Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you’re gonna have to do it without me.",
        "Then I’ve gotta go. Bye. (kisses him and starts to walk out)",
        "Yes?",
        "Really?!",
        "Pete's breaking up with me.",
        "I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk.",
        "Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.",
        "Really?!",
        "(starting to get up) I gotta go water Pete's plants. (stops) Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.",
        "Yeah. Which one do you like more?",
        "Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! (the lights turn on automatically, but are very bright) Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away! (they dim) Oh, see you just need to find the right command.",
        "No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.",
        "I know.",
        "Joey, put that down! (the phone rings) Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone! (steps in front of it, and automatically answers it)",
        "I guess that's how.",
        "Oh it’s umm, good! It's umm, it’s good, just here watering the plants.",
        "Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news.",
        "Oh no-no-no, it's still me.",
        "Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon.",
        "I love you.",
        "Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.",
        "Oh my.",
        "And that's Pete's Mom.",
        "Would you stop? We’ve only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don’t even know if he’s gonna propose.",
        "Well if-if that’s what it is, then it’s-it’s crazy.",
        "Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.",
        "Brides magazines?",
        "It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. (Rachel slams the magazine shut in amazement.) I know it’s a little sudden, and it’s a little rushed, and it’s totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn’t mean I can’t. Right? I mean I’m-I’m crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.",
        "I know. (pause) I need more pie. (goes and gets some)",
        "So then, are you going to dump Jason?",
        "Ooh, nice.",
        "Oh, right! I completely forgot about that.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Wow.",
        "What’s that?",
        "Okay. (not sure of herself)",
        "You wanna what?!",
        "What are you talking about?",
        "And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.",
        "My parents will be so happy.",
        "I need two. I’m bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now!",
        "Really? Who’s number two?",
        "Bye-bye!",
        "Joey, what are you doing?! It’s never gonna happen, she’s seeing somebody.",
        "(to Phoebe) Here you go. You can wear this. (hands her a sweater)",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Phoebe?",
        "All right. Honey, that’s-that’s a sleeve. Okay?",
        "And! We also have speaker phone. (She turns on the speaker phone.)",
        "Okay, wait, you gotta hang up ‘cause we’re gonna be late.",
        "Of course not.",
        "There’s our star!",
        "Hi!",
        "Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah. Where were you?",
        "You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.",
        "(entering from her bedroom) Pheebs, you’ve been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn’t healthy.",
        "Hey! Didn’t you have that outfit on last night?",
        "Anyway, how did it go with Kate?",
        "Joey, you had the night!",
        "When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!",
        "Did you like learn about her family?",
        "Yes!!",
        "Oh! (They hug, triumphantly.)",
        "One.",
        "We’re kidding!",
        "Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.",
        "Phoebe, it’s been two days.",
        "What?",
        "(sarcastic) Oh.",
        "Joey, she was listing the countries she’s done it in.",
        "(watching a happy couple walk by, arm in arm) Would you look\n        at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die\n        an old maid.",
        "(sarcastic) Thanks!",
        "Yeah right.",
        "You made a joke right? So I laughed.",
        "Well, no. You’re Chandler. Y'know, Chandler! (hits him on the\n        arm)",
        "Well I’d probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.",
        "Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!",
        "Seriously, where did you get the hat?",
        "What’s with all this sand? (picking a handful of sand off of\n        the floor, which is covered in sand)",
        "What?!",
        "What are you crazy?!",
        "Aww, thank you.",
        "(to Phoebe) So what’s Phoebe like?",
        "Ah no, the other Phoebe, the one you went to go see.",
        "Oh well, where is he?!",
        "(gasps) Totally familiar. (Phoebe shows the rest of them.)",
        "Well, why would she lie to you?",
        "Strip Happy Days Game?",
        "I think I’ll help her out. (She gets up to go over and help\n        Rachel, and reveals she has no pants.) (to Rachel) What is\n        going on here?",
        "You painting his toenails?",
        "Chasing him all around the room?",
        "He’s totally flirting with you too.",
        "Huh?",
        "You didn’t even take off your pants.",
        "What?",
        "Like a log.",
        "That’s that weird voice again.",
        "Yesss!!",
        "Shhh!",
        "Chip, is Chip Matthews.",
        "‘Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.",
        "I know!! (calls him) (on phone) Chip? Hi! It’s Monica. (listens) ‘Kay. (listens) ‘Kay. (listens) Okay. (listens) Okay, good-bye. (hangs up) Oh my God, we just had the best conversation!! (goes into her room as Rachel enters)",
        "Hey!",
        "Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?",
        "What, that little thing at the prom?",
        "Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?",
        "Look, you and I went to different high schools...",
        "You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip’s motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.",
        "It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.",
        "Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he’s-he’s called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.",
        "Oh, really?!",
        "I’ll try.",
        "Why can’t you use the phone in here?",
        "Ross, don’t start.",
        "Oh, but it’s made her so happy.",
        "He is right, isn’t he?",
        "Hi!",
        "(sliding into Joey’s place on the couch to try and talk to Phoebe) Huh? What’d ya say Joe? I’ll be right there. (gets up and joins Joey)",
        "(running from the bathroom to her room, wearing only a towel) Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! (gets to her room and closes the door, as Rachel gets up to answer the door.)",
        "Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!",
        "That’s what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you’re Chip. Nevermind.",
        "Wow! A lipper from Chipper.",
        "Umm. Well, there’s Rachel, and umm, I think that’s it. How bout you?",
        "Is that all?",
        "Ohh, how is he?",
        "Isn’t he an architect now?",
        "Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, ‘cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don’t even know where you work?",
        "I do?",
        "You still work at the multiplex?",
        "Thanks, I’m set. Do you still live with your parents?",
        "(entering) Oh my God! What happened?",
        "Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?",
        "Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.",
        "No, it’s okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.",
        "I know!",
        "Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.",
        "Me too. (they all leave)",
        "Rachel!",
        "You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!",
        "Have you ever taken out the trash? (Hands her the garbage.)",
        "Third door on the left.",
        "God! If you’re gonna cry about it! (She grabs the box and goes to through it out.]",
        "Joey, please don’t do that. I think it’s best that we just forget about it.",
        "(Picking up a card from Chandler’s wallet.) My God! Is this a gym card?",
        "What’s the matter?",
        "So do them for free.",
        "Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.",
        "You’re gonna do some feet flirtin’!",
        "What a minute, what did he say?",
        "I told you not to go down there!",
        "Rachel always cries!",
        "Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you’ve never sucked before!",
        "His dancing partner?!",
        "Oh, would you let it go already?! You’re fine!",
        "Wait, now so you joined the gym?",
        "Well, you could actually go to the gym.",
        "Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.",
        "Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?",
        "Yes you did! You did like a little hop.",
        "(laughing harder) You know the words! You are so into this!",
        "All right, then show me some manly moves.",
        "So you didn’t leave the bank?",
        "Oh my Gosh!",
        "(Entering from her bedroom) How desperate am I?",
        "I just told my Mom I’d cater a party for her.",
        "Because I need the money, and I thought that it’d be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.",
        "You don’t have to stick up for her. She can’t here you.",
        "Doing great, the quiches are coming along.",
        "Yeah, I thought it was cute.",
        "Let me ask you a question.",
        "Why did you hire me?",
        "(to Phoebe) Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I’m good.",
        "Oh yeah, she didn’t hire me out of pity, it wasn’t so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I’m good.",
        "…I think he deserves a Nobel Prize. (Joey starts to nod ‘Yes.’)",
        "What?",
        "Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn’t give me grief about me biting them.",
        "(Looks at her nails) Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put… (realises) Oh my God! It’s in the quiche! Oh My God!",
        "Okay ah, please don’t freak out. Umm, but ah, there’s a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there’s no way to know which one.",
        "Then why are you laughing?",
        "What? You bet I’d lose a nail?",
        "Frozen lasagnas?",
        "You bet that I’d screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was…",
        "You promised Dr. Weinburg, you’d never use that phrase.",
        "(laughs) That’s right. My Mom doesn’t have any faith in me! Oh, that’s hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.",
        "(interrupting) No! You have lasagnas! (Storms out and an awkward silence follows.)",
        "Hi.",
        "Ohh, I’m such an idiot. I can’t believe I actually thought she could change.",
        "Oh good, I’m glad that’s catching on.",
        "What?",
        "(getting up) All right, I’ll go down there. But, I’m not gonna serve the lasagna. I’m gonna serve something I make.",
        "Well?",
        "Really?!",
        "Yes!!",
        "And you?",
        "So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you…",
        "Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.",
        "Wow!",
        "That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don’t bite your nails.",
        "(in a sexy voice) Hello, Chandler. (Phoebe has a huge smile on her face.)",
        "Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?",
        "Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War? (Joey is pissed)",
        "(closing the fridge in disgust) Shoot! We’re out of soda.",
        "Really?!",
        "Sweety, what are you talking about?",
        "Oh.",
        "Ennnh.",
        "(screaming in pain) Ow!! Ow!!!",
        "Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!",
        "It’s like two miles!",
        "Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!",
        "What?! What is it?!",
        "What?!! Gross!!",
        "Well forget it! It doesn’t hurt that (tries to take a step) baaad!!!!",
        "Nothing, I don’t know.",
        "Nothing. I’m gonna take a shower.",
        "Pass the cheese, please.",
        "My God, you can’t even look at me! Can you?",
        "What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.",
        "(stopping him) No! Joey, we swore we’d never tell!",
        "(interrupting) All right!! All right. (walks slowly into the living room) I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn’t stand. I-I couldn’t walk.",
        "I was in too much pain.",
        "You can’t say that!! You-you don’t know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn’t...bend that way. So... (looks at Joey.)",
        "You bet.",
        "Hey!!",
        "(sets down some cards) Gin.",
        "Will you stop!",
        "Okay, all right, I think you’re great, I think you’re sweet, and you’re smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.",
        "Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?",
        "(Entering from her bedroom, talking on the phone) Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. (To the gang) I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.",
        "Sixty guests.",
        "Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.",
        "I don't know.",
        "Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.",
        "Well, you're not working either.",
        "Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you!",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow--the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!",
        "Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. (Picks up two frying pans) Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!",
        "Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look--I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh, is everything in the car?",
        "No. I hate this part.",
        "No, that's not mine.",
        "Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.",
        "Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...",
        "Just the matter of ...payment?",
        "Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.",
        "What?",
        "Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?",
        "Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.",
        "Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!",
        "I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.",
        "Oh, that's great! Congratulations!",
        "Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.",
        "And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.",
        "Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!",
        "I can cook and you can take care of the money.",
        "Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister.",
        "Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?",
        "No?",
        "Just go up to her and ask her out. (Chandler laughs) Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?",
        "Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.",
        "Just be yourself. But, not too much.",
        "That cold makes you sound so great.",
        "Y'know what, I like Kathy.",
        "Monica:",
        "(turning around and doing that, \"I'm making out with someone,\" thing with her hands) Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh! (She turns around and sees Gunther staring at her and stops suddenly.)",
        "Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?",
        "Hey!",
        "Rachel's not here.",
        "How's it going with her?",
        "Hi, Josh.",
        "So, did you play in college? (She points to his NYU Soccer (football for the rest of the world) sweatshirt he's wearing.)",
        "Very!",
        "It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.",
        "Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.",
        "Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.",
        "(sneezes) Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.",
        "(lying on the couch suffering from her cold) Ross isn't here.",
        "What?",
        "Why?",
        "Thank you so much Phoebe.",
        "What are you doing with those?!",
        "Sorry, Phoebe.",
        "Umm. (nodding her head, \"Good.\")",
        "Ohhhh!! Gross!!",
        "No, sorry.",
        "Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?",
        "Ross, cough drops, please?",
        "(interrupting) You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!",
        "And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'",
        "That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!",
        "We haven’t eaten yet!",
        "Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.",
        "Who cares? He works in a museum!",
        "What is wrong with this freezer?! (She jabs her arm into the freezer and a piece of ice flies into her eye.) Ow! Ow!!",
        "Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!",
        "Oh, y’know what, I can’t, it really kills.",
        "No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can’t go to him when I don’t have a boyfriend!",
        "Like I remember his office number! (Pause) Speed dial 7.",
        "Yes!!",
        "Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?",
        "Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.",
        "I was probably waiting for it to open.",
        "You look great too.",
        "So how does it look?",
        "Like a pirate?!",
        "Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? (He looks at her) Come on, one of us had to mention him.",
        "Oh. Big family dinner tonight?",
        "No way!",
        "(disappointed) Oh.",
        "(happy) Oh.",
        "(sympathetic) Oh. (in a pirate’s voice) So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?",
        "I know.",
        "Why is it sick?",
        "Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don’t you?",
        "Me going out with Richard’s son.",
        "Fine! Judge all you want to but, (points to Ross) married a lesbian, (points to Rachel) left a man at the altar, (points to Phoebe) fell in love with a gay ice dancer, (points to Joey) threw a girl’s wooden leg in a fire, (points to Chandler) livin’ in a box!! (goes to her room)",
        "(running in from her bedroom) I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! (opens the door) Hi, Tim.",
        "Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.",
        "And Joey.",
        "My brother, Ross.",
        "And Rachel. (Chandler clears his voice loudly) And that’s Chandler.",
        "Umm, well, he’s…",
        "All right everybody, this turkey is ready!",
        "Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.",
        "See he’s nice. Right?",
        "I saved you a seat. (Motions to the one next to her.)",
        "Oh-ho-ho, we’ve got company.",
        "(putting off her coat) Ooh, this always happens. (Her coat gets stuck.)",
        "Thank you.",
        "Y’know all my friends think this is weird.",
        "I know! I mean it’s like me and your dad, that’s a totally separate thing.",
        "We’re just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?",
        "Nothing. Nothing.",
        "No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss…",
        "(interrupting) Don’t say it!",
        "Yeah!",
        "I know!",
        "Oh, he’s catching up to her!",
        "Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.",
        "He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, \"The Sound.\"",
        "Yeah!",
        "(At a loss for words) Boy, that was-that was, umm… terrific.",
        "Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!",
        "(to Rachel and Phoebe) Y'know, there’s a Starbucks about three blocks down.",
        "(to Phoebe) Hey, aren’t you up next?",
        "Phoebe, Ross sucks!",
        "Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.",
        "Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!",
        "Are you serious?",
        "You obviously haven’t screwed over a lot of your friends. (They all look at her) Which we all appreciate.",
        "He loves you.",
        "I remember you did.",
        "(removing ear plugs) What?",
        "Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.",
        "Come on, no peeking! (They are leading the gang out with there hands over their eyes.)",
        "All right, umm, we’re not gonna really keep it this way though.",
        "(to Phoebe) Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?",
        "Well, I’m gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.",
        "Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence… dozens of people.",
        "Oh no-no-no, it’s only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.",
        "Oh.",
        "All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?",
        "Hey! My first review is out!",
        "All right, look at my on the back page.",
        "Hey, they don’t pay me a penny a word to make friends.",
        "Oh! Do you need me to go with you?",
        "Haven’t we made this decision?",
        "Bye!",
        "(answering it) Who is it?",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Oh my God, oh my God. (on intercom) Call me on the phone!",
        "Look, I-I’m never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.",
        "No! Phoebe!",
        "I couldn’t eat it! I had five friends who couldn’t eat it, and one of them eats books.",
        "The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!",
        "All right, that I’ll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn’t it. You’re marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.",
        "Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?",
        "Hand me those tomatoes, I’m gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.",
        "Okay, the owner of Allesandro’s came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!",
        "Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!",
        "You got the job?! Why didn’t you tell me?",
        "Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. (Rachel excuses herself) Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.",
        "I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it’s snowballing, y’know?",
        "I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro’s.",
        "It’s okay, ‘cause y'know what? You don’t really need me for the business.",
        "All right. But umm, I-I-I’ll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.",
        "Phoebe, wait a minute! (runs after her, leaving Rachel alone)",
        "(entering) Ohh, here you are. Y’know, I’m-I’m glad you decided to hear me out.",
        "I’ve been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.",
        "Or! A bakery delivery person.",
        "Pizza?!",
        "All right, I’ve got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I’m getting the feeling that you don’t want to deliver.",
        "Okay. I’m guessing that if you don’t want to deliver, you probably don’t want to pick stuff up either.",
        "Y’know what, let’s do the catering business.",
        "Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y’know what, it’d be, it’d be fun.",
        "Really?!",
        "Thank you.",
        " Umm, I just wanna say, uh (reads from a 3 X 5 card) that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... (Looks up and sees eveyone glaring at her) Are you gonna kill me?",
        "Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.",
        "I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this (puts on her chef hat) on my chef’s hat. (The hat says ‘Quit, bitch’)",
        "I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me. (Joey laughs and Monica glares at him.)",
        "I mean they’re trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I’ve been waiting for my whole life.",
        "I would love too, but I can’t! I mean I just can’t, you know that I’m not good at confrontation.",
        "That’s a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?",
        "All right, you’re hired!",
        "Didn’t your dad used to call you Pumpkin?",
        "(getting up) All right, I’m gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?",
        "You want a problem? I’ll give you a problem!",
        "You bet your ass, I’m gonna fire you! Thank you.",
        "Hey.",
        "They baked it. I can’t take this anymore. I’m gonna call a meeting tonight, I’m gonna fire you tonight.",
        "What are you doing?!",
        "Thanks. (Joey’s still patting the burn spot) I think you got it!",
        "Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?",
        "Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight’s specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag—Why is nobody writing these down?",
        "Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?",
        "Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here’s the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, (quietly) tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere…",
        "(louder) A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. (She holds her hand over her head as an afterthought.) From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! (Joey looks at the money he’s holding, and doesn’t speak up.) Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!",
        "What the hell happened?!",
        "Joey, we had a deal. That-that’s why you’re here! I’ve got to fire you!",
        "What kinda things have you been saying?",
        "I need more swordfish. (to one of the assistant chefs) Can you get me some more swordfish?",
        "You did a minute ago!",
        "Fine!",
        "Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I’m cold! (She spills something.) And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out! (the door opens)",
        "That’s not funny.",
        "(starting to cry) I’m a good person. And I’m a good chef, and I don’t deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y’know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is…",
        "You do?",
        "Well if you want a problem? I’ll give you a problem!",
        "You bet your ass I’m gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!! (Joey leaves) All right! Anybody else got a problem? How ‘bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?",
        "How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it’s funny now?",
        "Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, (to the kitchen worker from earlier) And you! Get the swordfish! (to another assistant chef) And you! Get a haircut!",
        "Thanks.",
        "Enough!",
        "No, you've messed it up. You're stupid.",
        "Are you serious?",
        "What did you tell them?",
        "Yeah, I mean you'd be pregnant. I mean, pregnant.",
        "We just want you to think it through.",
        "In the beginning, you know, where it's all s*x and talking and s*x and talking...",
        "And the s*x?",
        "Then what is it?",
        "Big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends. That doesn't mean he's good in bed.",
        "Sweetie, with you it's going to be different. The s*x is going to be great 'cause you guys are in love.",
        "I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me. [Rachel puts her arm consolingly around Monica]",
        "What?",
        "[to Chandler] So, did you do it?",
        "Uh-oh, was it bad?",
        "Well, it was the first time. You know, there's not always a lot of agreement on the first time.",
        "All right, I'm going to show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, hand me that pad over there. [Rach gets a pad and pen off the table and hands it to Monica.] All right. Now...[starts to draw]",
        "Now, everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got, [starts labelling her diagram] one, two, three, [Chandler nods impatiently], four [now Chandle looks up, surprised], five, six, and seven.",
        "[chuckles] Kind of an important one.",
        "Okay, now, most guys will hit one, two, and three and then go to seven and set up camp.",
        "All right, uh the important thing is to take your time. You want to hit them all and you want to mix them up. You got to keep them on their toes.",
        "Okay, you could, uh, start with a little one; a two; a one, two, three; a three; a five; a four, a three-two; a two, a two-four-six; [Monica starts to get into it ] two-four-six; four [Rachel kind of moves back and stretches out] a two; [Monica now has her eyes closed and is getting visibly excited] two; four-seven; five-seven [Chandler looks away from both of them as if he can't believe what's happening]; six-seven; seven, seven, [faster] SEVEN, SEVEN, SEVEN-SEVEN-SEVEN-SEVEN-[Chandler looks at her in disbelief] SEVEN-SEVEN! [Monica, eyes still closed, leans back and shudders and says silently, while holding up seven fingers, \"seven\".]",
        "You know, I never saw that.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "[to Phoebe] It's going to be so great.",
        "Would you surrogate?",
        "What if I asked?",
        "Really?",
        "No.",
        "Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?",
        "Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just…(Rachel grunts and throws her purse at it)…throw your purses at it.",
        "Oh my God, are you out of a job?",
        "Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can’t eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.",
        "If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that’s your department now. (She takes back the turkey leg)",
        "What are you doing?",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "You made pancakes?",
        "Okay. (She does so and starts to walk towards Joey to receive her pancakes.)",
        "Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.",
        "The players.",
        "(laughs) Please, it’s a relief is what it is, is what it is.",
        "Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!",
        "Please, have some!",
        "Yeah, I’ve just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.",
        "Yeah, it’s just something I picked up.",
        "Wait! Wait! This isn’t take-out!",
        "No, wait, please don’t go! I’ve got p0rn for you too!",
        "People are supposed to wanna hang out here!",
        "I’m the hostess! Not those guys! I’m always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.",
        "‘Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I’m-I’m done now. They’ve suffered enough.",
        "All right then, when I’m done with this place, it’s gonna be ten times better than that place!",
        "Are you sure?",
        "Nah, I got it.",
        "(entering) Okay, it’s ready. Come on.",
        "Just come.",
        "Pretty much. (to Joey) So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?",
        "You used to have carpet.",
        "So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I’m just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.",
        "Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I’m always the hostess.",
        "Boy, you are really not a morning person.",
        "What kind of changes?",
        "Oh, good luck.",
        "That is sooo not true!",
        "I just—I can’t believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Deal!",
        "Ha-ha!",
        "Aww, man!",
        "That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch.",
        "Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.",
        "Are you scared?",
        "Ross will do it.",
        "You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?",
        "Same category?",
        "Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!",
        "No!!",
        "I knew that! Rachel! Use you’re head!",
        "Viva Las Gaygas!",
        "You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds.",
        "Huh, wanna bet?",
        "How about we play for more money, say 150?",
        "You’re doing it again.",
        "We won’t. (to Chandler) 300?",
        "I’m just trying to spice it up!",
        "I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?",
        "Deal!",
        "Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand. (Holds up her hand.)",
        "No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.",
        "Come on!",
        "Come on!",
        "Sandwiches!",
        "Maurice.",
        "And processing.",
        "It’s umm, it has something to do with transponding.",
        "That’s not even a word! I can get this! I can get this!",
        "NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!",
        "Man, I feel like I’m coming down with something.",
        "Yeah. (to Chandler) I bet you can’t guess what color my tonsils are? I’ll bet the apartment!",
        "How do you feel?",
        "Really?! How much?!",
        "Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would’ve made them get rid of the birds. Right?",
        "All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it’s all your fault.",
        "Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!",
        "Well?",
        "It’s only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time.",
        "Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?",
        "I’ll take care of it.",
        "I lost our mattresses.",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey, don’t mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.",
        "Hey, we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question wrong!",
        "I can’t find garbage bags!",
        "What is it?!",
        "I can’t believe we’re living here!",
        "(not wanting to be left out, picks up something) Hey umm, what’s this?",
        "Hey, Joey, I don’t think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it’s only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?",
        "What’s Phase Two?",
        "You stink!",
        "Uh-oh, what’s the matter?",
        "I don’t know sweetie.",
        "I can’t! I have to work!",
        "No, Chandler’s still in Phase One, and Joey’s that thing you smell.",
        "I think she’s here.",
        "(looking out the peephole) Ohh, she’s looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can’t see people through that little hole, can you? (Goes back to the door.) Hello!",
        "I-I-I think you look great.",
        "What?",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Oh wait, Joey, you can’t go like that! You stink!",
        "Yeah. Run ten blocks, that’ll help the smell.",
        "So? How did it go with Joshua last night?",
        "What?",
        "So you hit her in the face?",
        "Hey! You’re wearing pants!",
        "It’s 9:30 in the morning!",
        "Hello. (Listens) Oh, hey Ross!",
        "Oh-oh, my God!",
        "(to Chandler) Shh!! (On phone) Wait, what?",
        "He’s with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!",
        "He had to go, there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.",
        "Why do you care so much anyway?",
        "Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.",
        "A couple of days.",
        "What are you doing?! Chandler! You can’t just go back a phase!",
        "Yeah, come on, we can be guys!",
        "(coming back to the stage and sitting next to Chandler) Okay, I’ve got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?",
        "Very good, (getting up and sliding a One into the dancer’s hot pants) so good.",
        "(to the waitress) When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.",
        "Oh! And don’t let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.",
        "I think somebody needs another lap dance. (Motions for one.)",
        "So, we did okay at the strip club, right?",
        "What, he doesn’t like Josh?",
        "Yeah. And y’know, if you wanna cry, that’s okay too.",
        "Come on! Chandler!",
        "They really were pretty, weren’t they? (Rachel and Phoebe both agree)",
        "Oh, Candy! She was so spunky!",
        "Y’know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. (Chandler is intrigued.) It’d, it’d be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.",
        "Oh, Chantal!",
        "Really?!",
        "That’s-that’s not Phase Three.",
        "Hey!",
        "Wait, now, what am I doing again?",
        "Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?",
        "Didn’t it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?",
        "They wouldn’t have put it there if it didn’t do something! How can you not care?",
        "Janice?!",
        "How have you been?",
        "Done?",
        "This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don’t work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.",
        "Yeah, well, I’m using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. (She flips on the switch and a hum starts.) I hear something! I hear something! Where is it? (They all start looking until Rachel realises it’s Joey.)",
        "He asked you out?!",
        "Saucy!",
        "Electrical plans for the building.",
        "I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they’d brighten up the place. They do don’t you think?",
        "No-no-no, no!",
        "I know that there’s no hole there, I just really liked that picture.",
        "Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!",
        "I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.",
        "No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.",
        "But it didn’t. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.",
        "All right. The super couldn’t figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn’t figure out what it did. I’ve had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.",
        "I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.",
        "What is it hon?",
        "Aww, honey I’m sorry.",
        "I don’t know how museums work in England but, here, you’re not supposed to take stuff.",
        "Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.",
        "You changed?",
        "And lucky means, more cleavage?",
        "Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.",
        "Or Spin the Bottle?",
        "Two in a row! You’ve got to use your tongues now! (They kiss again.)",
        "Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?",
        "Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can’t let—(pause), actually I kinda want to see what happens.",
        "Are you all right?",
        "I think you’re done.",
        "Well at least, I’m going to mute it.",
        "Hi!",
        "Okay.",
        "Hi.",
        "Oh. Why didn’t you take her?",
        "You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free p0rn!",
        "Hey, cheer up! You’re gonna see her again, right?",
        "(interrupting him) No-no-no, don’t-don’t do the accent. You’ve got to see her again.",
        "Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!",
        "No! Y’know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.",
        "Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!",
        "Do you love her?",
        "You love her!",
        "Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You’re probably just gonna catch her just as she’s about to go to the gate. You’re gonna call out her name and say, \"I love you!\" And she’s gonna say, \"I love you, too!\" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.",
        "Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in… (Ross looks at her.) I’ve been watching too much p0rn.",
        "Where ya going?",
        "How did it go with Frank and Alice?",
        "Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?",
        "And well, what did she say?",
        "Oh, you’re totally welcome! What’d she say?",
        "It is not over! You’re over!",
        "You know!",
        "It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn’t, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go! (Tries to push Ross out the door.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Phoebe, they didn’t make you pay for those knives, did they?",
        "Are you sure?",
        "This isn’t how it’s supposed to go, there can’t be another guy.",
        "Of course there’s another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!",
        "You have to go to London!",
        "Yeah, you have to go fight for her!",
        "When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?",
        "You sat back and let him have her, you didn’t fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?",
        "All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! (Points to the TV.) That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!",
        "Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don’t let her go without a fight!",
        "All right.",
        "Okay, good luck!",
        "That’s sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?",
        "Hello.",
        "Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?",
        "All right. When is, when is the next flight out?",
        "Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn’t show up by then, then just come on home.",
        "What are you doing here? You can’t be here!",
        "Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! (Points at Chandler) I was right! (Points to Emily) I’m right, right?",
        "Oh.",
        "Y’know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people’s s*x clothes.",
        "Um-hmm.",
        "Well, you’re making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.",
        "Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you (Points at Rachel) bitched about it, then you (Points to herself) would stop cooking, and you (Points at Rachel) would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.",
        "So, you wore your nightie to dinner?",
        "Oh, no!",
        "Emily’s straight.",
        "This totally makes sense!",
        "Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren’t jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!",
        "This is so much fun!",
        "Look, all we’re trying to say is, don’t let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.",
        "Chandler, that’s like your fourth cup of coffee!",
        "He’s in a different room! He’s really that loud?",
        "Y’know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over…",
        "He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.",
        "Have you guys picked a date yet?",
        "Ugh, she’s upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya something! I’m not doing them this time! I don’t care if those dishes sit in the sink until they’re all covered with—I’ll do them when I get home!",
        "I’ll pick it up for you!",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh my God! Ohh! Look at this one! It’s so beautiful!",
        "Oh, yes, umm, I’m here to pick up a dress that you have on hold.",
        "Emily Waltham.",
        "(laughs) Okay.",
        "I am, aren’t I?",
        "Yes?",
        "All right. (Goes to take off the dress.)",
        "Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I believe she does. (Looks at the wedding dress and stops.)",
        "Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming. (There’s a knock on the door.) Uh, just a second!",
        "Phoebe?",
        "Can you just hold on for one minute?",
        "Are you alone?",
        "All right.",
        "Okay, ready?",
        "Okay.",
        "Congratulations!",
        "Okay! My turn! My turn!",
        "(cocking her head from side to side in some pre-bouquet-catching ritual) Yeah.",
        "(upset) That was a terrible throw!!",
        "Look at me! My big concern is what’s real?! (Finally realises) Oh my God. We’re really sad, aren’t we?",
        "This isn’t even my dress.",
        "I’m changing out of this.",
        "In like a half-hour?",
        "Okay, throw it straight this time.",
        "I’m getting married next!!",
        "Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn’t you start feeling silly?",
        "Oh God.",
        "Hey!",
        "So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?",
        "No, seriously.",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? ‘Cause I don’t think you have to wear it unless you are!",
        "Ohh, sweetie! (Goes to comfort her.) Hey, I bet you anything that he’s gonna call you again.",
        "Again. Y’know what? I think we all did.",
        "Hey! (She jumps up and throws Emily’s wedding dress into Rachel’s room.)",
        "Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. (Pause) Maybe someday, there will be.",
        "Oh God! He’s gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!",
        "No-no, Rachel, don’t get it! He can’t see us!",
        "Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.",
        "Y’know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!",
        "Okay.",
        "Shut up! This place is a hole!",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?",
        "Yeah, apparently, they’re pretty good seats.",
        "Yeah, what, do you think we’re stupid?",
        "What do you say?",
        "Have you even had a girl up here?",
        "(entering with Rachel) All right boys, last chance for the tickets!",
        "All right, so what do you say?",
        "Oh, just do it!!",
        "They’re green?",
        "That’s not even a game!",
        "You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?",
        "Oh, good.",
        "Okay. (She picks a card.) Four.",
        "Because we won our apartment back!",
        "No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!",
        "But, we pick again! We pick again!",
        "I don’t know!",
        "We’ll discuss it, in the morning! (Slams the door shut.)",
        "No, we’re not! We’re not leaving!",
        "As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.",
        "Men are such idiots.",
        "Yeah, let-let-let’s pretend that’s not true.",
        "What-what’s going on?",
        "When, when did—how, how did you…",
        "(to Ross) I can’t believe you’re getting married!",
        "That’s also like the tenth time you told us.",
        "What?",
        "I thought that was a good thing.",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah, there’s one right under the cabinet.",
        "Why do you need it?",
        "What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come you’re having a party and we’re not invited?",
        "Sooo?",
        "Nooo!",
        "The baby shower for Phoebe!",
        "Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! (She shows Rachel what she bought. She bought a little leather jacket and a little cowboy outfit for the babies.) Can you believe they make these for little people?",
        "Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite. (It’s a little pink and white dress for the girl baby.)",
        "I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!",
        "Because she’s not gonna get to keep the babies.",
        "Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she’s done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.",
        "Oh, she’s gonna love that!",
        "Hi Phoebe.",
        "Hormones.",
        "Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That’s great. So how-how are things going?",
        "Here’s your tea Phoebe. (They give it to her and quickly take a step back.)",
        "I’m so glad you liked it.",
        "What?!",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Wait, you can’t have the baby here! I mean I haven’t sterilised it since the guys moved out!",
        "Rachel, get the book! The book!",
        "The Bible?!",
        "How do you feel?",
        "Some moms do that.",
        "Aww, sweetie, but it’s not like you’re not gonna have anything. You’re gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that’s even better.",
        "I mean, you’re the one they’re gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about s*x.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, sweetie! (They all hug.)",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Hey.",
        "I know. How could we have let this happen?",
        "Ugh! Well, y’know, we were away…",
        "I blame London.",
        "So look umm, while we’re st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?",
        "Only here.",
        "I’ll meet you there in two minutes.",
        "(impatiently) Now?",
        "Oh, I-I don’t know.",
        "Just uh, do the right thing. (Uses some breath spray)",
        "Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box! (Tries to leave, but is stopped by Rachel.)",
        "Wait. Rachel, no, he’s married. Married! If you don’t realize that, I can’t help you.",
        "Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?",
        "Why?!",
        "Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn’t eat meat until she has the babies!",
        "That’s true.",
        "Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!",
        "Yes, I want to change. And why-why don’t you go down and get us a table?",
        "(elbows him) Fifteen minutes.",
        "Great…",
        "But my clothes are—ohh! (They both leave.)",
        "No time for that!",
        "Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It’s My Giant!",
        "You really think this is okay?",
        "Oh, it’s so beautiful. Ohh! Y’know, I-I don’t know if I feel right about this.",
        "Okay!",
        "You didn’t find her?",
        "Yeah, I think you should keep looking!",
        "Or 45.",
        "Well, it’s getting late.",
        "Ugh, y’know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.",
        "I know, I’ve been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don’t you think?",
        "Y’know, maybe it’s best that we never got to do it again.",
        "I’m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I’ll see you there in a bit?",
        "I know!",
        "Phoebe, I did not have s*x.",
        "Well, we certainly are alone.",
        "Right. Umm, listen since we’re-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross’s mother…",
        "Well, an-anyway, I just—that night meant a lot to me, I guess I’m just trying to say thanks.",
        "(laughs) That’s okay.",
        "And you’re cute too.",
        "Okay.",
        "That counts!",
        "Rachel?!",
        "Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (TO RACHEL) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? ",
        "Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can’t believe my brother’s getting married! And in London! It’s so romantic!",
        "Hey!",
        "I never knew that either.",
        "We’re hanging out.",
        "I’m sorry honey.",
        "Rach, you’re gonna come though aren’t you?",
        "You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren’t there. Just say you’ll think about it, okay?",
        "I can't believe he did this.",
        "You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.",
        "Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.",
        "Oh, dad, turn it off.",
        "If you're not going then I don't want to go either.",
        "I can't believe you did that.",
        "(seeing the decision) Nooooo. You’re really not going?",
        "You don’t have a car. And your license expired.",
        "Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!! (She runs back to her apartment.)",
        "Passport, check! (As she puts away each item, she says check.) Camera, check! Traveller’s cheques, check!",
        "Myself. Y’know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check! (pause) My mom does it, I never realized it was weird.",
        "Hey!",
        "Yep! You got the tickets?",
        "Okay, if you need the vacuum, it’s in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator…",
        "Yeah, okay, give that a try!",
        "All right, y’know what? We really are late! Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go!!",
        "Chicken Kiev?",
        "Yeah, y’know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn’t have to worry about the salmonella. (Ross pushes her.) So, I can’t wait to see this place you’re getting married!",
        "It’s nice.",
        "(entering) Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened.",
        "They torn it down a few days early.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Hey!",
        "(laughs) Yes, I did! And you are welcome!",
        "Umm…",
        "She said that?!",
        "Why?!",
        "Oh my God. You’re even dumber than I am!",
        "Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?",
        "Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That’s what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake (Starting to cry), with the little people on top. (Ross gets thrown a box of Kleenex from the bathroom and he gives her one.) Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.",
        "Sometimes we were.",
        "Okay.",
        "You’ll see.",
        "And the musicians, look, they can go over here (Points to a little alcove), okay? And the chairs can face this way (Points), and… (Points to Ross) You go.",
        "Ohh. And I don’t even have a date.",
        "Hey.",
        "Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!",
        "Ha ha, a joke that’s funny in all countries.",
        "(Looking nauseous from her parents kissing.) And I’m going to go get drunk. (Gets up to get a drink.)",
        "I was laughing. (Patting him on the knee.)",
        "Well I didn’t want everyone to think I was stupid.",
        "My mother’s driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. I’m happy. (A drunken man approaches.) I’m not going to let anything spoil that.",
        "Well, thanks, we like him.",
        "Then why would he say it?",
        "Oh, my mother’s right. I’m never going to get married.",
        "Ohh, Please?! I’m a single mom, with a thirty year old son!!",
        "(Comes up for below the covers and looks concerned.) Do you think he knew I was here? (Chandler quickly looks at Monica not knowing what to say.)",
        "(In am uneasy voice.) Nope. (She chuckles uneasily.)",
        "Yep, yep...You?",
        "Well...I’d better get going.",
        "(Scoots towards the side of the bed.) Could you not look?",
        "Well, I love it. I only hope my wedding looks this good.",
        "(Angrily.) You can let some of them go by!(Judy and Andrea go to the front of the chapel. Joey approaches Monica.)",
        "(Awkwardly.) Why would I care where Chandler is? You know uhh...You know sometimes I don’t even like Chandler.",
        "Stupid.",
        "What were we thinking?",
        "Oh yeah. Definitely.",
        "You look cute in bubbles.",
        "Chicken? I could eat some chicken.",
        "Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?",
        "Bodington's!",
        "Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, (Checks watch) she should be here by now.",
        "No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.",
        "Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!",
        "I'll do it!",
        "Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.",
        "Honey, sweetie, by the edges.",
        "Ohh. (Monica covers her eyes in horror.)",
        "Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!",
        "Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn't about me.",
        "If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! (Gunther turns to listen in.) I mean, he's nice, he's cute.",
        "(Interrupting) Oh, what about that guy over there? (She points at another guy and Gunther is deflated.) Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.",
        "You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.",
        "We got out pictures back from London. (Shows her one.) Here's all of us at the Tower of London.",
        "What happened?",
        "See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!",
        "What took you so long?",
        "Oh, good.",
        "Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.",
        "(Poking her head in) Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.",
        "What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!",
        "I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?",
        "(Gasps) What?!! You cannot tell him that!!",
        "I make the decisions, and I say no.",
        "You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say, \"I'm not fired!\" Ha!",
        "Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!",
        "Rachel locked the door.",
        "Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!",
        "Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?",
        "I really need to talk to you.",
        "Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?",
        "Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might (Turns to look at Ross) end up hurting.",
        "All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.",
        "Please!",
        "Joey, I'm in!",
        "Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic (Phoebe gasps), in Central Park!",
        "Makes me wanna puke! (Chandler looks at her, quizzically.)",
        "Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?",
        "Come on Rach, let's go.",
        "No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.",
        "Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?",
        "Okay. I-I can't watch. (Leaves as sits down to read the paper.)",
        "Oh my God! You're water broke!",
        "I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!",
        "Do you know anything about women?",
        "That's all right.",
        "Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.",
        "Oh man! I did it again!",
        "What?",
        "That's what it sounded like.",
        "Umm. (Looks at Chandler who is using the phone.) Umm. Umm. I don't think so.",
        "Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.",
        "Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?",
        "Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.",
        "Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.",
        "Feeling a little better sweetie?",
        "Me too.",
        "(entering with Chandler) Hey!",
        "(To Phoebe) How are you doing?",
        "Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!",
        "Chandler!",
        "So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?",
        "Oh, great!",
        "Bye Dan!",
        "Great!",
        "Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.",
        "I think you're better than you think you are.",
        "(interrupting) Know when to stop.",
        "Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. (They kiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts to dance. Without turning around.) Don't do the dance.",
        "I think you're my favorite.",
        "I don't care.",
        "Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!",
        "(In a sexy voice) Come in. I've been waiting for you.",
        "(pulling on a robe) Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap.",
        "Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. (Thinks) I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!",
        "Uh-huh, that one!",
        "(Panicking) Okay, umm, okay, umm… (Rachel opens the door.) It's just Joey and Ross.",
        "But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?",
        "Vomit tux? Who vomited on—y'know what, what you up to Joe?",
        "Oh that's great!",
        "What's wrong with PBS?",
        "Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don’t think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",
        "I might've said that. (Chandler laughs.) Why is that funny?",
        "Hey!",
        "That's great!",
        "What?!",
        "But you live here! (Ross rolls his eyes.) You know that.",
        "Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.",
        "Sure!",
        "Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.",
        "Great!",
        "What?! You can't—what did you tell her?",
        "Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.",
        "No, you cannot.",
        "(answering it) Hello.",
        "Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?",
        "(Looking at the TV) You're not on TV.",
        "(entering) Hi Chandler.",
        "Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.",
        "William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.",
        "Yeah, so?",
        "Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.",
        "Why? (She hops into the living room and imitates Chandler's happy dance.)",
        "A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!",
        "All right, let me see. (She grabs the 8 ball.) Will Chandler have s*x tonight? (Reads the answer.) Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.",
        "Keep talking.",
        "Really?",
        "Well, if we owe it? (She throws down her cleaning stuff and jumps into his arms.) Oh my… When is Joey gonna be home?",
        "But, I just cleaned the bathroom.",
        "Yeah. (She takes them off.)",
        "Okay.",
        "Ow!",
        "I know!",
        "Never done that before.",
        "(quietly) Hi!",
        "Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.",
        "I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.",
        "All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.",
        "Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!",
        "Wait! What about Joey?",
        "(entering from her room) Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.",
        "Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.",
        "Hey.",
        "No, she's out shopping.",
        "Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?",
        "Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?",
        "Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles…",
        "Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.",
        "Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!",
        "Come here. (He does, and they kiss.) Okay, be right back.",
        "We're switching rooms.",
        "No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. (He glares at her.) Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?",
        "We're switching rooms again.",
        "This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.",
        "(To Chandler) Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?",
        "Chandler!",
        "Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!",
        "Okay, this one I like!",
        "Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?",
        "Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!",
        "I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!",
        "We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?",
        "What did you say?",
        "(entering) Hi!",
        "Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?",
        "Oh, it was awful. (To Chandler) I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.",
        "Chandler! (Motions for him to come outside.)",
        "Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.",
        "300 dollars?!",
        "Urghh!!",
        "Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!",
        "Maybe I could do it.",
        "Hey.",
        "You're not gonna be phased out!",
        "Hi.",
        "Yeah, it did.",
        "What?",
        "Why, exactly?",
        "Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than—Ohhh! (They both realize something there.)",
        "(laughs) You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.",
        "Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship! (She goes to kiss him.)",
        "I'm afraid so.",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.",
        "Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.",
        "Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!",
        "Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.",
        "I know, it's great!",
        "Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.",
        "Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.",
        "Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!",
        "Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! (They all leave and close the door on Monica.) Ohhh! (Throws her notepad down in disgust.)",
        "What?!",
        "Okay.",
        "Sorry.",
        "(To Chandler) Rachel's at work.",
        "Hey, what's that?",
        "What is that?",
        "(looking at the flyer) This is all of your things.",
        "So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.",
        "Now calm down Joey.",
        "Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?",
        "Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.",
        "All right. (Looking through a box.) Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?",
        "Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!",
        "We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!",
        "And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!",
        "Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!",
        "We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Wow! That guy is so rude!",
        "Well you did a little bit.",
        "I totally forgive you!",
        "Yes!",
        "Hey!",
        "Crematorium Chris? Sure!",
        "Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.",
        "No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.",
        "God, I feel so guilty about Ross.",
        "Whatever you decide, whatever you do.",
        "Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.",
        "Hey, look at you! Where have you been?",
        "How did that happen?",
        "I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.",
        "Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.",
        "I'll get it. (On phone.) Hello. (Listens.) Hi Emily! (Listens.) Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second. (She hands the phone to Ross.)",
        "How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!",
        "Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering.",
        "Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.",
        "That's very nice.",
        "Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?",
        "Oh, let's not tell this story.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Hey, did you get the turkey basted—Oh my God! Oh my God! (She sees someone is stuck in the turkey.) Who is that?",
        "What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?",
        "Well, get it off now!",
        "Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!",
        "Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. (Joey starts giggling.) Joey? Now is not the time!",
        "Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!",
        "That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.",
        "Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.",
        "Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!",
        "I'll get it! (She runs in, and she's her old fat self like The One With The Prom Video. Not only that, she's out of breath after running a short distance. She goes over and opens the door to reveal Rachel with her old nose.) Happy Thanksgiving!",
        "Oh, why? Why? What happened?",
        "Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower.",
        "Ross! (Wanting to be introduced.)",
        "Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.",
        "Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.",
        "dammit! (Runs off.)",
        "I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.",
        "Call them mom and dad you loser!",
        "Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?",
        "Okay!",
        "Oh that's so great!",
        "Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything.",
        "I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!",
        "No. No, thank you!",
        "Well, I do.",
        "Yes, it was!",
        "(interrupting her) Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!",
        "Hi, Chandler.",
        "What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress? (She turns around making sure he gets a good look.)",
        "So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.",
        "Well it didn't!",
        "Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!",
        "How?",
        "What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!",
        "Yeah.",
        "And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!",
        "Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have s*x with him?",
        "What do you mean?",
        "(excited) I can do that!",
        "Umm, I'd love too! (She goes over and picks up the box and decides to follow Rachel's advice and holds the box up to her cheek.) Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.",
        "Boy, I love carrots! Oh! (She picks up a bunch of them and holds them between her fingers.) Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. (She is rubbing her hip with the carrots.) Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife (She picks up a knife without putting the box down. She's holding the box between her cheek and shoulder) and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, (Pause) my body. (She doesn't have any exposed skin within reach of the knife, so while holding the carrots in one hand and the box between her face and shoulder, she rubs the knife on her stomach.)",
        "Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that—(She drops the box and in a reflex action tries to catch it with her arm, the knife slips out and slowly flips through the air and comes point first down into Chandler's shoe.)",
        "Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice! (She takes a bag of ice out of her purse and hands it to the doctor.)",
        "What?! What is it?",
        "God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!",
        "Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!",
        "I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.",
        "I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!",
        "Chandler! (Follows him out.)",
        "Chandler, I said I was sorry.",
        "Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?",
        "Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)",
        "Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)",
        "I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)",
        "What?",
        "You said you loved me! I can't believe this!",
        "Yes, you did!",
        "You love me!",
        "Oh, Larry.",
        "Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.",
        "Larry?",
        "Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.",
        "It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Hmm?",
        "He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try…",
        "Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.",
        "(To Monica) Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?",
        "Ohh, fun!",
        "Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.",
        "And you're not gonna do that.",
        "So-so there is no party.",
        "I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.",
        "Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.",
        "You are?",
        "Okay.",
        "What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!",
        "Great. So the ball is in his court?",
        "Hey!",
        "I don't know, clean places?",
        "(looking through the peephole) It's Danny.",
        "(to Danny) We'll be right there! (To Rachel) Can't you just say it starts later?",
        "The fake kind!",
        "We have a ladle. (Gives him one.)",
        "Okay, great!",
        "Just go over and say hi.",
        "Hey, Danny!",
        "(turns his back to the stairs) Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. (As she's saying this Rachel tries to head downstairs but is blocked by people coming upstairs. She quickly retreats back up the stairs.) (Sees that she has to keep him distracted longer.) So umm, what's this? (Points to his plate.)",
        "Ooooh! (Rachel now succeeds in getting downstairs.) And-and-and what-what's this? (Points again.)",
        "(upon seeing Rachel she points) Oh.",
        "I thought there wasn't a ball?",
        "I think I need a drink.",
        "Yeah!",
        "(entering) Thank you Joey, thank you so much!",
        "(inspecting his leg) Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.",
        "We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.",
        "We are! Help us!",
        "Joey!",
        "Hey, Phoebe!",
        "Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but (motions that he can have it.)",
        "Phoebe, you are a bad ass!",
        "Phoebe?",
        "Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.",
        "We're so sorry.",
        "Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.",
        "Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview. (Hands him a Polaroid.)",
        "I know.",
        "Ross, are you okay?",
        "Why?!",
        "A pill?",
        "Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?",
        "(yelling and waving her hand in the air) I know! I know! I know!",
        "(grabbing the picture) Give me that!",
        "It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!",
        "Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!",
        "Oh no!",
        "Yes it's true.",
        "I guess I wanted to keep it (Pause) as a souvenir.",
        "I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.",
        "I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.",
        "(entering, happily) All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!",
        "Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! (Running out) We should have essay questions!!",
        "You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular. (Chandler laughs.)",
        "Danny? You know Rachel? She’s nice. She’s not bad to look at, right?",
        "Do you want to go out on a date with her?",
        "Friday’s perfect...She can’t wait.",
        "(Walking in from off screen.) Phoebe!",
        "I just wanted to see how it's going.",
        "(Taking out her wallet.) Well good, here let me help you out.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yeah. I guess. (She puts more money in the bucket.)",
        "Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay? (She pours out the rest of her change purse into the bucket.)",
        "Hey, what's up?",
        "Oh, honey, I'm sorry.",
        "You had no relationship!!",
        "Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.",
        "Come on, hurry!",
        "No.",
        "No.",
        "Eww!! (Throws the bucket down.)",
        "Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.",
        "Hey!",
        "All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.",
        "Still, I was quick as a cat.",
        "Oh, you're kidding.",
        "(laughing with Ross) We don't, we don't wrestle now.",
        "Too strong for me?",
        "You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?",
        "Ready? (They grab a hold of each other's necks.) Wrestle! (They start wrestling.)",
        "That was unbelievable!",
        "Hi, how are you doing Kelly?",
        "It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it?",
        "This is disgusting!",
        "Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?",
        "I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.",
        "Ooh, and I can do this. (She kisses him on the cheek.)",
        "Hi, nice to meet you!",
        "What was that?",
        "That noise you just made?",
        "Really? Your work laugh?",
        "All right, check me out.",
        "Really?",
        "Hey, I thought you already had one.",
        "Hi!",
        "What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.",
        "Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.",
        "Okay. Umm…",
        "Okay, what's going on with you?",
        "Well, I-I—there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore.",
        "Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?",
        "Game!",
        "Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!",
        "I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.",
        "Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.",
        "They have racquets don't they?!",
        "I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.",
        "I got it! (She hits a forehand smash that bounces right in between Doug and Kara and scores a point.)",
        "I got it!!",
        "I can't believe you let them win!",
        "I was frustrated.",
        "I was frustrated with you!",
        "Y'know what really bothers me? Is—it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the \"I'll see you around, Bing!\" \"Not if I see you first, Doug!\" (Mocks the fake laugh.) I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.",
        "I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.",
        "Oh my God! (She goes to hug him, stops short, and hits him on the shoulder.) Where the hell have you been?!!",
        "My turn? What-what are you talking about?",
        "What?!",
        "Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.",
        "Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big…(Thinks)…ot.",
        "Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.",
        "Me and Chandler?! (Does her fake laugh.)",
        "Oh, none for me. Thanks.",
        "(To Chandler) How does that laugh not give you a headache?",
        "Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.",
        "I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.",
        "(interrupting) Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.",
        "Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?",
        "I thought you could use the help.",
        "Sorry! I'm just—I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!",
        "I know! It's just that…ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.",
        "(entering) Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!",
        "Wh-wh-what are you doing here? (She tries to pull her shirt down to cover the fact that she's wearing men's boxers.]",
        "Okay great!",
        "Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!",
        "Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work.",
        "Okay.",
        "I'll get back to my new job.",
        "I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!",
        "That was a half an hour?",
        "Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!",
        "It's so good, isn't it?",
        "Say good-bye to sore muscles!",
        "(entering, in a hurry) Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having s*x in a car right outside.",
        "Ohh my God, I'm so sorry.",
        "(to the guys) Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?",
        "What?! What honey?",
        "Oh, did you catch him?!",
        "All right, let's go say good-bye.",
        "Well, at least you scared someone.",
        "Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you.",
        "What are you talking about?",
        "(indignant) I give good massages! (Ross laughs.) I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch! (She starts giving Chandler a massage.)",
        "No he's not!",
        "What?!",
        "You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.",
        "But the minute we start to lie to each other… (Pauses after she realizes what she's saying.) And by 'we' I mean society.",
        "No.",
        "Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me—just say, \"I don't like your massages.\"",
        "(starting to cry) See? It's no big deal.",
        "I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.",
        "(bursting into tears) My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.",
        "Oh my God! You don't know me at all!",
        "I'm crying here!!",
        "Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?",
        "So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?",
        "Okay. I suck!",
        "Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.",
        "Oh no, wait! Joey!",
        "Happy New Year.",
        "She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.",
        "Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.",
        "Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.",
        "Hi Ben!",
        "I like 'em.",
        "I like them a lot.",
        "It's my New Year's resolution!",
        "No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.",
        "Thank you. (Leaves.)",
        "(on phone) I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.",
        "(on phone) Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big…",
        "We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.",
        "Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! (Shows him Ben's picture.) Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!",
        "See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.",
        "Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.",
        "You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?",
        "Okay, now you're even cuter!!",
        "What?",
        "What are you talking about?",
        "That's not possible!",
        "I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.",
        "I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.",
        "This bicep?",
        "Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.",
        "Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?",
        "Okay.",
        "I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.",
        "Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?",
        "Well what did you send?",
        "Bye!",
        "Actually, I did!",
        "Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!",
        "Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!",
        "Them?! Who's them?",
        "Joey!",
        "Unless…",
        "Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So…",
        "(in the kitchen with Chandler) Look at them, they're-they're panicked!",
        "Oh yeah!",
        "All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have s*x with her! It'll totally freak her out!",
        "Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!",
        "Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!",
        "Just go get some! (Kisses him.) Go! (She runs to hide in the bathroom.)",
        "She's bluffing!",
        "You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!",
        "Of course.",
        "I love you too Chandler. (They kiss.)",
        "Well actually, Ross doesn't.",
        "What are you doing?!",
        "Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. (They go to the door. Ross is trying to stick his hand through and undo the chain; Monica pushes his hand back.) (To Ross) Hold on! (She opens the door.) Hey Ross. What's up bro?",
        "I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too.",
        "Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.",
        "But what?",
        "In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?",
        "I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?",
        "Isn't this great?",
        "Couldn't you just stay like this forever? (His eyes snap open.) Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?",
        "Are you okay?",
        "What-what are you doing?",
        "Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!",
        "Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.",
        "Oh and you know what I want!",
        "I do not have baby fever!",
        "Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!",
        "You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?! (She storms out.)",
        "Gunther, can I get a coffee (Looks at Chandler) to go?",
        "I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.",
        "What?!",
        "Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one. (She walks out.)",
        "(raising her hand) I'm Monica.",
        "Okay.",
        "Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!",
        "No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!",
        "Chandler, why are you doing this?",
        "Chandler.",
        "Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?",
        "(kneels with him) Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.",
        "Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!",
        "Who? Two divorces and Joey?!",
        "Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.",
        "Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?",
        "Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.",
        "Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.",
        "I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.",
        "I would love to do it together!",
        "It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.",
        "That doesn't seem fair.",
        "Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah, me too! (Runs and grabs her 3-ring binder of ideas.)",
        "All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.",
        "Oh, we're not doing that. Okay…",
        "What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!",
        "(Thinks) Cups.",
        "And ice!",
        "Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant…",
        "Hey! How'd the audition go?!",
        "Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's (sadly) \"Audition didn't go so well. (Happily) Yeah it did?\"",
        "You got a callback too didn't you?",
        "(To Rachel) How did work go?",
        "You stink!",
        "No, I'm-I'm serious!",
        "That's so gross!",
        "Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding. (She's not; she stands and walks away. Chandler moves closer.)",
        "(overhearing that) Why don't you just go out with her!",
        "Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!",
        "Y'know…go! Go! Right there! (Points)",
        "That's the surprise!",
        "Hey!",
        "(checks to see if it works) Yes, you are so smart! (Kisses him.)",
        "I know.",
        "Okay.",
        "Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!",
        "Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but…",
        "Yes! You are so smart! (Kisses him.) I love you.",
        "Wow!",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?",
        "I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.",
        "Are you saying I smell bad?",
        "What's with him?",
        "(cooking something) Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!",
        "Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this. (Holds out a spoon for him.)",
        "What is going on with you?",
        "What was the dream about?",
        "Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn’t mean that-that you're in love with me!",
        "No!",
        "Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.",
        "Um-hmm.",
        "Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! (Looking at Chandler and slowly realizing what his point is.) But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!",
        "You become friends after?",
        "(laughing) That's right.",
        "Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!",
        "What about the closeness?",
        "Who is it?",
        "Let me try. (Gets up to join them.)",
        "Did I squeeze it too hard?",
        "Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?",
        "Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!",
        "(joining him) Wow! She is pretty, huh?",
        "What happened?",
        "No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV.",
        "What?",
        "Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?",
        "I know it is the best.",
        "What? It's still going on.",
        "I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.",
        "(Start annoying hyper-competitive mode now.) (Jumping up) What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don’t you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!",
        "Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!",
        "You are so cute. (She goes over and kisses him passionately.)",
        "(entering from the bathroom) Hey Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren called, you got a second interview!",
        "Yes!",
        "A kiss? What are you talking about?",
        "He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.",
        "Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?",
        "What are you doing?",
        "(That annoying competitiveness thing kicks in again, what the heck is that with her and why must the writers show it every flippin' episode?!) Oh, we're not seeing a movie!",
        "Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?",
        "Okay. (She gets up and walks over to Chandler.) Chandler? Can I see you for a second?",
        "Okay. (They walk away to get some privacy.) We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.}",
        "'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!",
        "So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of s*x to prove them wrong!",
        "Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.",
        "We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best.",
        "No, you're the best.",
        "I am the best.",
        "(looking out the window) Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?",
        "Why?",
        "What are you talking about? (Pointing out the window.) She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!",
        "No, those first two windows, (Points) that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.",
        "You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?",
        "Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.",
        "You didn't!",
        "The park huh? A public place.",
        "I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second! (Gets up and heads for the bathroom as that annoying Gotta-win-at-all-costs-super-competitive thing kicks in again.)",
        "Hi Chandler.",
        "Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?",
        "Come on, we can't let them win!",
        "Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!",
        "I feel really sad that we're not…really there anymore.",
        "Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?",
        "Really?",
        "That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.",
        "Yeah. (They hug.)",
        "Did not.",
        "Okay, I freaked out a little.",
        "Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!",
        "(entering from the bathroom) Hey! Happy Anniversary!",
        "So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London…",
        "Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?",
        "That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.",
        "That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.",
        "(runs over to Phoebe) You have got to go home!",
        "You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.",
        "Great!",
        "(noticing Rachel crawling behind the couch) Rach? What are you doing?",
        "It's a diaper commercial.",
        "What's goin' on?",
        "It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.",
        "It's no big deal, I do it all the time.",
        "Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!",
        "Chandler, this actually bothers you?",
        "What?",
        "(following her) Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.",
        "No you didn't.",
        "Yeah, it's good.",
        "Chandler! (Joey and his grandmother shush them and wave them away, which they do.) Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.",
        "Go on, teach me something about men and women.",
        "No way!",
        "Well that's pathetic!",
        "And this goes for all guys?",
        "No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!",
        "(entering from her room) Phoebe! (Motions for the earrings. Phoebe gives her the one-minute sign.)",
        "Yeah, what is it?",
        "(shocked) Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.",
        "All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.",
        "Look at you! Come here! (They hug.) Feel better?",
        "(angrily) That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! (Rachel looks over at Phoebe in resignation.) Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!",
        "Yes!",
        "What about these? These look the same?",
        "Not as each other!",
        "Hi!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.",
        "Oh, honey, the earrings…",
        "My boyfriend really does have good taste!",
        "Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!",
        "Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know… And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See? (Hands her the photo.)",
        "You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.",
        "All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.",
        "I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.",
        "All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash.",
        "Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around…",
        "What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that!",
        "(on the answering machine) Rach! It's me! Pick up!",
        "I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.",
        "See if he has ice.",
        "(does Rachel's) Nooo!",
        "Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!",
        "We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?",
        "I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn’t that give me the right to control him—help him?",
        "No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. (Rachel slowly turns and glares at her.) (Realizing what she just said.) Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! (Rachel again turns and glares at her in disgust.) Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.",
        "Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.",
        "All right, I guess we should go.",
        "Oh yeah right! (She grabs the money and shoves into her pocket.)",
        "There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!",
        "Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.",
        "Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!",
        "Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.",
        "(To Rachel) Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor.",
        "Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!",
        "It's not Richard! Okay? It's this new guy and he's really good.",
        "Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I? (And on the \"I\" part she mimics poking her eye.)",
        "Bye!",
        "Why are so mad at him?",
        "Well, it just seems that…",
        "Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. (Quietly) You can go.",
        "Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!",
        "No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All right, let's go Blinky! (She ushers Rachel out the door, but before the door fully closes she sticks her head back in.) Chandler!!!! (Chandler agrees to clean up the mess.)",
        "(looks at it more closely) Oh that's an eye removal machine.",
        "I'm kidding! I'm kidding!",
        "A small puff of air, now come on!",
        "Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head.",
        "Okay. (Monica backs off.)",
        "Dr. Miller? (She covers her right eye and reads from the chart) P E C F D.",
        "I sure do! (She runs over to a drawer, opens it, and grabs a lollipop.) (To Rachel) And you don't get one!",
        "They're still in my coat.",
        "I love you.",
        "I wanna say good-bye at the car!",
        "Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!",
        "Chandler! What are you doing here?",
        "Not even close.",
        "Okay! All right! Let's do it!",
        "Sit down. (They sit down on the couch.)",
        "Put your head back.",
        "All right.",
        "Now, open your eyes.",
        "How many fingers am I holding up? (She's not holding any up.)",
        "Oh my God, I was thinking four.",
        "Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run? Okay?",
        "No drops!",
        "Okay.",
        "On three, 1…2…3! (Rachel turns her head on three to avoid the drops.) Now my pillow's all wet! (She was trying to fool Rachel and squeezed the eyedropper.)",
        "Then why did you move?!",
        "All right, come here! (She gets up and drags Rachel off of the couch by her legs.)",
        "I am going… I'm going--Turn it over! (Rachel rolled onto her stomach and Monica rolls her back.) I'm… I am going to get these drops in your eyes. (She is holding Rachel down with both hands and has the eyedropper in her mouth.)",
        "(spitting out the eyedropper) Damn! It's empty!",
        "(answers the phone) Hello? (Listens.) (To Phoebe) It's Joey. (Phoebe's proud of herself.) (To Joey) I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.",
        "What did you do to his sweater vests?",
        "Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second. (She hands the phone to Phoebe.)",
        "Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.",
        "(answering it) Hello?",
        "Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!",
        "Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?",
        "Go!!",
        "Okay! Okay! Okay! (She succeeds in getting the eye drops in and everyone climbs off of Rachel.) We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.",
        "Are you sure you wanna do this?",
        "Whoa!",
        "What are you guys doing here?",
        "Why else would we be here?",
        "This is insane!",
        "What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you’re married everywhere.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Hey.",
        "How do I tell Chandler that it’s too soon. It’s gonna break his heart, he’s not gonna think that I don’t love him anymore.",
        "Yes I do!",
        "Oh hi! Hi! Y’know, we were just talking about bacon.",
        "Rach! We weren’t gonna miss our friends getting married!",
        "What are you guys gonna do?",
        "So, what do you think we should do?",
        "I know I love you! (They hug.)",
        "That’s a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!",
        "All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don’t get married.",
        "Okay. (They approach the craps table.)",
        "Ready?",
        "(sarcastic) Come on eight.",
        "Wow! I can’t believe I actually rolled an eight.",
        "Wait a minute. That wasn’t a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.",
        "I wanted it so bad! (Pause) Wanna go pack?",
        "Ohh, of course we are! (They walk up to the elevators.) We left it up to fate. (Pushes the elevator button.) If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign. (The elevator door opens to a priest reading from a bible with Chandler and Monica standing side-by-side holding each other’s hands.)",
        "That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.",
        "He took my snack!",
        "Okay! Oh God, y’know what? It’s really bad.",
        "This doesn’t mean anything, does it?",
        "Okay.",
        "No, don’t say it! Don’t even think it!",
        "I’m sick of the signs! It’s too fast, I’m happy the way things are!",
        "I don’t want things to change! Do you?",
        "All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because it’s been three days and it’s driving me insane!",
        "Then all your stuff would be here.",
        "Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn’t make any sense.",
        "Live together? There have been no signs for that.",
        "YES!!!!!!!!",
        "Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!",
        "Here’s your key (Gets him one.)",
        "Here’s your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in!",
        "Ready!",
        "Wait! Oh my God! I can’t get out!",
        "No, it’s not a sign! It’s a very old key!",
        "Oh my God it’s old!",
        "I love you!",
        "No.",
        "(entering) Phoebe? (Phoebe comes back into the living room) Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?",
        "Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.",
        "The Richard.",
        "Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache?",
        "It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.",
        "Really?",
        "The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!",
        "Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.",
        "I know.",
        "What?",
        "It's almost our anniversary!",
        "I got you a present!",
        "I know, but you have to open it today! (Hands it too him.)",
        "(grabbing the gift from him and opening it) Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas!",
        "For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.",
        "No.",
        "Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!",
        "But we can go, right?",
        "Okay!",
        "Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!",
        "Aww! I love you!",
        "Okay!",
        "I love the \"I forgot the present\" fake out!",
        "Oh that's okay. Don’t worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.",
        "Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.",
        "Really?!",
        "Great!",
        "Phoebe, you don't eat animals.",
        "Who are you talking too?",
        "I'm so sorry.",
        "I knew you were not okay with that.",
        "It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?",
        "You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.",
        "I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.",
        "I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!",
        "Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.",
        "Fine! Happy Anniversary!",
        "No it is not!",
        "(to the bartender) Thank you.",
        "I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!",
        "This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.",
        "Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you! (Gets up to find Chandler.)",
        "Anybody lose this? (Holds up the chip and the woman next to her shakes her head no.)",
        "Hmm.",
        "All right baby, come on! (Rolls the dice) Yes! Yes! I am on fire!",
        "Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!",
        "What? Wait! Why? (He turns and heads for the door and she chases after him.) Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I’m sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!",
        "Not any more.",
        "Really! (They hug and kiss) All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. (She picks up his suitcase.) Okay, this is empty.",
        "Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.",
        "We have one.",
        "(shaking the dice) A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man! (Rolls the dice.) Yes!",
        "That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?",
        "Pick a number! That is your only job!",
        "Thank you!",
        "Yes!",
        "(To Chandler) We're not really gonna buy these people steak dinners are we?",
        "Okay, good! Okay, what do I want now?",
        "What?",
        "Okay. (Rolls the dice)",
        "All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on! (Rolls the dice.)",
        "Oh, that's because I had lunch with Rich—Me neither! Okay, what do I want now?",
        "Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8!",
        "Shut up!! It just got interesting!",
        "What did you just say?",
        "Are you serious?!",
        "I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.",
        "Okay!",
        "Nobody move! (To Chandler) Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!",
        "That could be a four or a five. It's your call.",
        "I think so too.",
        "Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.",
        "You're so efficient. I love you!",
        "No-no-no! We need something old!",
        "That'll work!",
        "Okay, now we just need something borrowed!",
        "That's stealing!",
        "Ohh. (Rubs her fake stomach.)",
        "Yep, we wanna get married!",
        "All right.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "No, only because that's the graduation song.",
        "Are you sure you wanna do this?",
        "No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.",
        "So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?",
        "(shocked) Oh my God!",
        "I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?",
        "I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral…",
        "(sitting down) Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!",
        "He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!",
        "Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!",
        "Ohhhh!",
        "That is so sweet! (She kisses him and turns to add some sugar to her tea.)",
        "(entering) Hey guys!",
        "Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. (Goes to the counter) It was right here, where is it?",
        "All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!",
        "Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!",
        "What?!",
        "Really?!",
        "(on phone, faking she's sick) I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good. (Joey makes a high throw and Monica has to catch it way over her head.) (Not sounding sick) Yes!! (Realizes what she just did.) (Sounding sick again) Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not. (Hangs up and keeps throwing the ball.)",
        "Rach?",
        "You have scratches all over you, what happened? (Rachel's arms are covered with scratches.)",
        "(shocked) What?!",
        "I don't want a cat!",
        "(To Rachel) What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!",
        "(jumping in front of him) No-no! Don't do it! Don't!",
        "He's a dropper!",
        "Oh my—Oh good God!",
        "So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?",
        "Rach, why won't they take it back?",
        "Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.",
        "Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! (Quickly grabs a tissue to wipe her eyes.) Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.",
        "So you're moving in with him. What happened?",
        "Why, do you write him a lot?",
        "Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!",
        "Please! I made this game what it is.",
        "All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?",
        "All right! Let's go! (Runs to the door.) Let's go Team Monica! (The guys all stop and stare at her) All right, we can work out the name later.",
        "Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!",
        "Wow! You made a profit!",
        "All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!",
        "It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!",
        "Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha! (Runs out the door and everyone watches her leave.)",
        "Of course! Joey wouldn’t let you have one?",
        "Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you’re moving out?",
        "Y’know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I… We just have to get it over with! Y’know, the next time we see them we’re just gonna tell them. Okay? That’s it.",
        "Pretty much.",
        "Hi!",
        "Joey, we have something to tell you.",
        "Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!",
        "Hey Pheebs!",
        "Hey, have you seen Rachel?",
        "I have some pretty exciting news!",
        "No! Chandler and I are moving in together!",
        "Hey!",
        "Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.",
        "Okay, come here! (Phoebe joins them in the hug.)",
        "Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn’t seem so bad? (Exits.)",
        "Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!",
        "I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she’s the only one left!",
        "No.",
        "Have a seat. (They sit at the table.) Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I are going to live together, here.",
        "Really?!",
        "Yes, we are. (Chandler is frantically trying to get Monica to correct her.)",
        "Yeah, he’s gonna work on that.",
        "(singing) We’ll be waiting for you…",
        "Soon! I-I just couldn’t before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn’t do that to her, she’s my best friend!",
        "I’m not your best friend?",
        "All right, all right, at least I’m prepared.",
        "(slapping his hand) Hey!",
        "These aren’t for you! Are you upset?",
        "Rach, there’s something uh, important I have to tell you.",
        "No! But, I’m throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.",
        "Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.",
        "Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn’t clear! I’m really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There’s absolutely no rush.",
        "Okay. Don’t you want a cookie?",
        "Maybe, do you need a tissue?",
        "I made them!",
        "(entering) Hi.",
        "So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.",
        "Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn’t cry. She wasn’t angry or sad. (Sits down, slightly disgusted.)",
        "I mean, all I’m asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don’t I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!",
        "Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.",
        "Y’know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.",
        "Hey Rach, what about this? (She holds up a chrome 5-point star.) Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don’t know if I want it because it might be y’know, too many memories!",
        "I don’t know. (Picks up a big plate from the coffee table.) Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.",
        "Something to remember me by!",
        "But still, it’s a big change. The end of an era, you might say!",
        "I’m fine! I just, I’m thinking how much it’s an end of era.",
        "An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn’t significant to you!",
        "What is the matter with you?!! Why aren’t you more upset?! Aren’t you gonna be sad that we’re not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren’t you gonna miss me at all?!",
        "What’s hard to believe?",
        "Rachel, it’s going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.",
        "No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn’t something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.",
        "Yeah, sweetie.",
        "No.",
        "I’m gonna miss you! (They hug.)",
        "I know!",
        "You’re kidding!",
        "Ross!",
        "Joey, why don’t you put them in the lost and found?",
        "Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!",
        "Don’t worry about it Phoebe, we’ll absolutely do it.",
        "Come on Chandler, come on! It’ll give us great practice for when—(realizes what she’s about to say and changes)—people with babies come to visit.",
        "Pheebs, how’s it going?",
        "Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it’s going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.",
        "What do you mean?",
        "This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.",
        "Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.",
        "I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.",
        "And six others.",
        "Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that’s the same.",
        "Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone’s eye out!",
        "Oh it’s so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.",
        "How are you still single?!",
        "Good. What made you change your mind?",
        "Damnit! Y’know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler! (He does it again.)",
        "And people will think you own a Porsche because you’re wearing the clothes?",
        "Joey, you know you don’t actually have one.",
        "All right, that’s it, we’re going to the emergency room.",
        "The babies are asleep, I’m sure you’ll be okay on your own for a while!",
        "He’s got something plastic lodged in his throat, we’ve got to go to the hospital.",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Phoebe, what, what happened here?!",
        "But my apartment!",
        "But the mess!",
        "You’re right, you’re right I shouldn’t freak out. ‘Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!",
        "Who’s Denise?",
        "Okay listen, y’know when you move in Rachel’s room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?",
        "Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven’t thought about it that much.",
        "No.",
        "Oh, I’m sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.",
        "I just don’t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.",
        "What do you have against the beautiful guest room?",
        "Are you mocking me?",
        "Hi.",
        "Stop it Chandler. (Chandler is relieved) I’m sorry too.",
        "Yeah! Oh yes!",
        "Listen, we don’t have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.",
        "Totally!",
        "Oh good.",
        "Changes?",
        "You’re-you’re-you’re gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?",
        "Well, it’s a set and they should probably stay together.",
        "See now-now you’re taking them away from their home.",
        "Yeah-yeah, y’know what? Yeah, that’s it-that’s it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That’s-that’s what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I’m talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn’t match! Where is it gonna go?!",
        "Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!",
        "Ross, we can handle this.",
        "Love is the best medicine.",
        "Why do you do it?",
        "Yes.",
        "That’s very funny!",
        "Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.",
        "Yeah, no, me neither.",
        "You still want to move in together right?",
        "Ross didn’t scare you?",
        "Come here, I want to show you something!",
        "This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it’s still walking distance to the kitchen.",
        "Okay!",
        "Uh-hmm.",
        "Oh my God! I love that!",
        "Uh, no!!",
        "(entering from her room) Hey!",
        "(thinks) Okay.",
        "Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we’d go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.",
        "It’s not your birthday.",
        "You’re not dressed yet?! We’re supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!",
        "Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you’re packed.",
        "(entering) Rachel, I need to borrow—You’re not packed!!!! You’re not packed even a little bit!",
        "What?",
        "No, no don’t get mad because look—this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, \"What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!\" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!\nMonica: (grabs a bag of those Styrofoam peanuts) I’ll be coordinator! Oh my God! I’m so sorry, I didn’t get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can’t you Phoebe?",
        "You’re plans were with us.",
        "All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!",
        "Okay! (To Rachel) Oh my God, thank you!!",
        "(entering and interrupting the guy’s escape attempt) Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we’re gonna start with…",
        "I thought you said you were going to do nothing.",
        "Okay fine, now Ross…",
        "Why not?",
        "It’s almost 8 o’clock, it’s almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?",
        "Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!",
        "All right, sorry. (Goes back to Rachel’s room.)",
        "(starting to cry) Oh God!",
        "No.",
        "I’m gonna miss you so much.",
        "I don’t think there’s anything.",
        "Nope, she’s perfect.",
        "Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.",
        "Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.",
        "Yeah, well I don’t think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.",
        "Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Ross! (To Rachel) See? Other people call me!",
        "(on phone) What’s up?",
        "Oh, put him on!",
        "\"Hi I’m Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I’d better wash it and shrink it!\"",
        "\"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!\"",
        "I’m not talking to her!",
        "Well, maybe you’re right—She made fun of my phone pen!",
        "Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about—What are you doing? (She sees that Rachel is unpacking.)",
        "What?!",
        "It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!",
        "Because it’s my apartment!",
        "How about, you’re moving!! (Grabs a bunch of clothes and throws them into a box. What follows is a brief sequence of Rachel unpacking and Monica packing the same stuff over and over again as Rachel chants \"No.\" and Monica chants \"Yes.\")",
        "(entering) I am not!",
        "No Phoebe I am mad!",
        "Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, \"What were you thinking?\"",
        "Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.",
        "Y’know she has 147,000 pairs of boots…",
        "She lets you borrow them.",
        "Do you wanna live outside?! Because it’s gettin’ cold! (To Phoebe) She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I’d like.",
        "When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.",
        "When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.",
        "And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. (To Rachel) (Starts to cry) You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! (They both break down in tears.)",
        "Kinda. (She hugs Phoebe and looks out the window. She moves closer to it to get a better look.) Oh my God!",
        "Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?",
        "I’m really gonna miss you.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Bye.",
        "She really left.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Can I ask you a question?",
        "What the hell is that dog doing here?! (She notices the dog sitting in the living room.)",
        "This bottle opener. (She grabs it off of the freezer door.)",
        "And it’s a magnet!",
        "Hey Rach, aren’t these candlesticks (holds up a pair) mine?",
        "Ohh! Yeah, I forgot.",
        "(under her breath) That you’re a liar. (Hides the candlesticks in a drawer.)",
        "Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?",
        "Hey!",
        "Phoebe that’s crazy!",
        "Hmm? (Rachel holds up the candlesticks.)",
        "No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.",
        "I loved them!",
        "Hey!",
        "How’d the lecture go?",
        "That you’re not funny or sexy?",
        "Yeah, but y’know we could sneak in and watch.",
        "What the hell are you doing?!",
        "(in an Irish accent) Monica Gellerrr. (She rolls her ‘R’)",
        "(normal voice) Oh, you can have an accent and I can’t?! (To an exiting student in accent.) Top ‘O the morning to ya laddies!",
        "Gimme ‘em!",
        "You stole them from me!",
        "Gimme them!",
        "You just wanna each take one?",
        "Why don’t you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America.",
        "I think you look fine.",
        "Okay, come on, do it one more time!",
        "Yes!",
        "Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.",
        "Hey guys.",
        "It was okay. She’s still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.",
        "Yeah.",
        "No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.",
        "I don’t think mine likes me either.",
        "We should go.",
        "Hey.",
        "What happened to your teeth.",
        "Well, I think I shouldn’t look directly at them.",
        "Ross they’re really, really, really white.",
        "How much longer?",
        "Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?",
        "She will be after tonight.",
        "Oh my god.",
        "My God, Rachel, I can’t believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, I’m so jealous. (Chandler looks at her.)",
        "Chandler, please, come on. Look at him. (Pointing to a picture of Ralph on a magazine,.)",
        "(Holding a shirt in front of Ross.) Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. (Ross has a big smile.) Nope. Okay, colors that don’t work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.",
        "Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn’t look so bright.",
        "I’m just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.",
        "Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.",
        "Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.",
        "All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.",
        "Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn’t waste these pantyhose.",
        "Wait, we’re supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.",
        "You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You’re right, I’m sorry.",
        "Yeah. Go over to Joey’s. Go over to Joey’s and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.",
        "When girls hang out, we don’t have pillow fights in our underwear. (Chandler gets a hurt look on his face.) I’m sorry. We do. We do. I don’t know why I said that.",
        "Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.",
        "Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I’m going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.",
        "Hey!",
        "(jumps over a box) Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!",
        "Oh, So you can move them!",
        "It's nice to meet you. Janine...?",
        "Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?",
        "Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?",
        "Oh, so you like her too Chandler?",
        "Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.",
        "Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.",
        "(chuckles) Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.",
        "Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?",
        "So, Phoebe runs weird huh?",
        "Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.",
        "I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.",
        "We'll see.",
        "(on phone) Hi!",
        "Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.",
        "It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.",
        " Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?",
        "What?!",
        "Why is Ross naked?",
        "Naked?",
        "Is it the same thing that Chandler had?",
        "Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!",
        "Is it okay for me to come in now?",
        "Why is everything different?",
        "Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.",
        "It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?",
        "Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.",
        "Of course!",
        "All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. (Gets her cleaning gloves on) Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?",
        "Honey, we have been through this before!",
        "You serious?!",
        "Really?!",
        "Bye. (Janine exits.)",
        "I am so glad you said cooks.",
        "You got it from Pottery Barn?!",
        "Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.",
        "Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.",
        "It’s gotta be one of a kind. Y’know like umm, y’know uh, what’s that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?",
        "I’m telling—If you put that in her apartment you’ll never hear the end of it.",
        "I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!",
        "Yeah.",
        "So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I’ll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.",
        "Joey, you don’t have too!",
        "Tomorrow!",
        "Hey!",
        "The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.",
        "What happened to Janine?",
        "Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!",
        "(loudly) What?!! (Quietly) What?",
        "Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!",
        "Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.",
        "(from the hallway) I do not like that woman!",
        "I am loud!",
        "Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?",
        "(loudly) I know!!!",
        "Well, I’d like to but, (extremely quietly) I’m not sure we have time to go.",
        "We owe you?!",
        "We didn’t give you any money! (Chandler is motioning, \"No!\")",
        "Don’t worry about it.",
        "Absolutely!",
        "Good night! (They go into their respective apartments.)",
        "(bursting in) I knew it!! Y’know, you’re not so quiet yourself, missy!",
        "(steps up and points at her) All right! You and me! Let’s go! Right now!",
        "(to Janine) You’d better hope I don’t see you in the hallway!! (They exit.)",
        "What did I tell you about the hall?!",
        "Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.",
        "Now come on. (They hug like men.) Well, I’m glad we worked things out.",
        "Okay.",
        "Bye. (Leaves to resume her garbage removal task.)",
        "(hearing that) That’s it big girl! (Hits Janine in the butt with the garbage bag) Come on!",
        "(chasing her) You’d better run!",
        "I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.",
        "Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It’s about being with the people that you love.",
        "Oh, here.",
        "Aw, I’m sorry sweetie that she doesn’t feel the same way.",
        "Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rocking Eve?",
        "Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!",
        "We are there!",
        "What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!",
        "We are going to Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rocking Eve!",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Okay, here comes another camera.",
        "If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They’ve been taping those people up there all day.",
        "Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?",
        "Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He’s the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.",
        "Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren’t wearing underpants?",
        "Man, this sucks! Y’know if Mom and Dad don’t see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who’s gonna be the losers then?",
        "What?",
        "Ross, we haven’t done the routine since middle school.",
        "Was it really that good?",
        "Okay, let’s do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!",
        "5 6 7 8!",
        "Yes! (They run over to a platform)",
        "I know! Hey, you haven’t been practising the routine, have you?",
        "Me too!",
        "Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don’t wanna look stupid!",
        "Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?",
        "We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled ‘CUT!’",
        "Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. (To Ross) Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!",
        "What? We could do it!",
        "I can do it, okay? Come on, let’s go. (She and Ross get up)",
        "I can’t do it! (Ross falls into Monica’s room)",
        "(on phone) Okay, great!  Bye. (Hangs up as Chandler enters.) So guess who’s coming to Thanksgiving dinner?",
        "(not amused by Chandler’s joke) I miss Rachel. (To Chandler) No, my parents.",
        "Yeah, and y’know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! (Quickly trying to change subjects), I was thinking we would eat around four.",
        "Because they don’t know we’re dating. (Again, trying to quickly change subjects.) Do you think we should eat in the kitchen? (Goes to the sink and the stove to cook.)",
        "Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn’t.",
        "(trying to change subjects, excitedly) So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I’ll see you then. (Pats Chandler on the shoulder and goes into the living room.)",
        "Well, um, because mainly, um, they don’t like you. I’m sorry.",
        "Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you’re really sarcastic, or that, y’know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.",
        "Look, I know that I should’ve told them. I know I shouldn’t care what they think. I’m sorry.",
        "You really think that’ll work?",
        "(hugging Chandler) I don’t think you’ll ever get my parents that drunk!",
        "Nothing.",
        "No, sweetie, I-I trust you.",
        "You’re not gonna mess it up.",
        "Well, it’s done about two minutes before it looks like that.",
        "Whoa whoa whoa! Where’re you goin’?",
        "Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?",
        "You’re not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you’re gonna eat here!",
        "Dad [kisses Jack], Mom [kisses Judy]. Look! Look who it is it’s Chandler!",
        "Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.",
        "Y’know dad, Chandler is one of Ross’s very best friends!",
        "Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.",
        "(shocked) What?",
        "Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you (points to Chandler) were trying to get Ross stoned!",
        "Ross, I can’t believe you’d do that!",
        "You! It’s not like it’s a big deal! You-you don’t still do it or anything!",
        "Dad, please don’t pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you’re gonna put your feet up, why don’t you sit on the-",
        "Ross, if you don’t tell them, then I will!",
        "Really?",
        "Okay.",
        "(faking joy. Rubbing her stomach and smiling at the same time, like Joey said) Mmmm! It’s good!",
        "It’s so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who’s eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.",
        "(again, lying) I’m gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.",
        "Ross? Let’s go.",
        "Alright, you know what? That’s it. You’ve had your chance.",
        "(out loud, to her parents) Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!",
        "And Dad, y’know that mailman that you got fired? He didn’t steal your Playboys! Ross did!",
        "Ross hasn’t worked at the museum for a year!",
        "Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!",
        "Well actually, I-I didn’t eat mine. It’s still in the bathroom.",
        "That didn’t work on mom, it’s not going to work on us.",
        "No.",
        "Well, you tell a lot of jokes!",
        "(relieved) It’s only you.",
        "So do you think that these pictures—Are, are they trying to tell a story?",
        "Well, she’s not going to find them lying in the grass like that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Okay, I’ve got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?",
        "Me neither.",
        "What?!",
        "(visibly upset) She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.",
        "It’s wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.",
        "That’s a good idea.",
        "Do you know what’s a bad idea?",
        "That’s right. (A noise comes from the living room.) Did you hear something?",
        "It’s coming from the living room.",
        "(entering) Hey, you guys.",
        "(laughing) Oh, don’t you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple.",
        "(laughing harder) Nothing, I’m just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. (To Phoebe) Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.",
        "(angrily) It wasn’t funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn’t you pick me?",
        "That is completely untrue. You think I’m high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we’re going to go through it point by point!",
        "(to Phoebe) You start working on that list. (She grabs her coat and leaves, too.)",
        "I know. Where do you wanna go eat?",
        "I’m sick of Japanese. We’re not going there.",
        "All right.",
        "No, thank you.",
        "Joey, what are you doing?",
        "Joey, do you work here?",
        "Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?",
        "So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?",
        "Hah!",
        "Well, then, I’m okay with being high maintenance.",
        "I am not high maintenance!",
        "Why do I have to decide?",
        "I can’t be fair. You’re my boyfriend.",
        "Okay, Chandler, you go first.",
        "Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?",
        "Do you want me to pick you?!",
        "Continue.",
        "All right, I’ve heard enough. I’ve made my decision.",
        "You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it’s offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn’t be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!",
        "Hi, Chandler. There you are.",
        "Hey, it’s Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don’t you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?",
        "Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.",
        "Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!",
        "Ahhh! You are on my list.",
        "(embarrassed) (To Phoebe and Rachel) I didn’t even tell him to say that. (They hug). All right you’re off my list.",
        "(sits next to him) Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.",
        "I pick you, Phoebe.",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh that’s great!",
        "I mean think about all the money that you’re gonna make!",
        "Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?",
        "Oh, I love museums!",
        "Soakin’ up all the culture.",
        "Where do you want to start?",
        "Yeah!",
        "This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn’t put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there! (Points to both places.) I mean you’d have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch. (The arch at the entrance to the room.)",
        "What?! Are you crazy?! I’m not getting married! I’m not even engaged.",
        "Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.",
        "Phoebe, that stuff is…",
        "Hi, honey.",
        "What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!",
        "Oh no!",
        "Oh please, he didn’t hear it! He didn’t hear it!!",
        "NOOOO!!!!!!!!",
        "Phoebe!",
        "Have you seen Chandler?!",
        "The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! (Phoebe gasps.) I know! How bad is this?!",
        "I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can’t find him anywhere!",
        "Well, I’m never gonna listen to you again, that’s for sure! (Mimicking her.) \"Y’know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?\"",
        "Well Rachel’s not here! (Runs out.)",
        "(going over to him) I’m so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.",
        "Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what’s the harm in that?",
        "Chandler, please don’t think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel…",
        "It was a mistake. Please don’t take this to mean anything, because it doesn’t.",
        "Really?",
        "I know! I know.",
        "I’m gonna go tell Joey that (laughs) that you’re back. I was really worried about you. (Exits.)",
        "It’s Chandler’s way of pretending he didn’t take mime.",
        "Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.",
        "You’re on the phone!",
        "Come on! (The girls all run out and Joey holds up Chandler by smiling.)",
        "Oh well, it’s not so bad.",
        "Joey! He’s working! (To Chandler) You would look good in that.",
        "Isn’t that mine?",
        "(pulling Rachel back down) Yes, they can stay with us.",
        "Hey!",
        "Wow! So, now you’re going on a date with this girl?",
        "You’re right, I’m sorry. It’s not like you’re y’know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.",
        "You dated her!",
        "All right, well why don’t I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!",
        "Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?",
        "I know! Now look, there’s only one problem though. There’s only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey’s.",
        "So Rach! You’re the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you’ll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, y’know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.",
        "Now there you go! I wouldn’t want my best guest to strain her eyes!",
        "Does that smell bother you?",
        "Well you let me know if you can, because y’know I can bake a pie to cover it.",
        "Okay!",
        "Hello? (Listens) Oh yes, one minute please. (To Phoebe) It’s for you. It’s the fire inspector.",
        "So it’s okay to date a student.",
        "Well Ross, you be careful now. You don’t want to get a reputation as y’know Professor McNailshisstudents.",
        "Joey that is so sweet.",
        "What?! You’re going out with her again!",
        "Joey! You didn’t even know her!",
        "Hey! How’s it goin’?",
        "Yes it has! I made cookies!",
        "But you should eat them now because they’re hot from the oven.",
        "(pulling the plate back) Oh-ho! But not in here! Can’t eat ‘em in bed, remember? No crumbies!",
        "Okay!",
        "(opening the door) What are you doing?",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "(congested) Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can’t work if I’m sick.",
        "I’m not sick!! I don’t get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!",
        "(wiping her nose) I have not been sick in over three years! (Sneezes.)",
        "I don’t need a tissue! I’m fine-d!",
        "I’m fine-d. I’m fine-d! Y’know, it’s a really hard word to say.",
        "Rach? (Points to Jill.)",
        "You bought a boat?",
        "Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let’s do something crazy!",
        "Okay, I’ll rest. But y’know if I’m going to bed, then you’re coming with me.",
        "(wiping her nose) Are you saying that you don’t wanna get with this? (Tries to do a little sexy body rub, but it doesn’t work all that well with the big robe.)",
        "(in a sexy voice) Come on. (Coughs loudly.)",
        "I’m with you Chandler! I mean I can’t have s*x with a sick person either, that’s disgusting! But I’m not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.",
        "(still sick) Chandler!",
        "(trying to be seductive) Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.",
        "How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.",
        "Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I’m not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel. (Sneezes.)",
        "I’m fine. (She goes into one of those half sneezing, half-coughing fits that you get with a bad cold or flu.)",
        "(entering) Chandler, I think I’m sick.",
        "Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest? (She hands him some of that Vicks Vap-O-Rub to put on.)",
        "Come on! I really need your help!",
        "Fine, I’ll rub it on myself.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?",
        "I can’t believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?",
        "Not now, I’m sick!",
        "What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?",
        "Okay, if you really wanna have s*x…",
        "Worked like a charm.",
        "(calling from the bathroom) Is someone there?",
        "(entering with Chandler) Who? (She looks out the window at Ross’s apartment) Is that your sister?",
        "God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!",
        "Oh no it’s not, no it’s not. It’s a first date. I’m sure that nothing is gonna…(as she is talking we see Ross close his drapes.)",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Why did they get divorced?",
        "And what if I was still fat? (To Chandler) Well, you wouldn’t be dating me, that’s for sure.",
        "He’s not boring! He’s just-he’s just low key.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Oh no! What’s the matter?",
        "Okay.",
        "Bye.",
        "Maybe Joey doesn’t have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?",
        "No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!",
        "Hey Phoebe! Guess what?",
        "Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!",
        "Hey!",
        "(gets up and gasps) Oh my God! Rachel!! (Rachel is stunned to see that her long lost friend is still fat.) (Monica goes over and gives Rachel a big bear hug, which is quite easy for her.) You look terrific!",
        "You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!",
        "Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we’ve seen each other?",
        "Rach, he’s a friend of ours.",
        "(getting up) Joey!",
        "Ohhh! (Takes the plate.) No! This is my friend Rachel, we went to High School together.",
        "No.",
        "(laughs) You realize what you are don’t you?",
        "You’re his bitch.",
        "(panicked) Oh wait! You didn’t just sit on my Kit-Kats did you?!!",
        "What?!",
        "Yes!!",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Honey, having a heart attack is nature’s way of telling you to slow it down.",
        "Let’s take a walk. (They start to leave.) Y’know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine! (They exit.)",
        "Sorry. So how’s it going with Joey?",
        "Yeah! She’s right in there! (Points to Phoebe’s room.)",
        "Oh my God! That’s great! Oh wow! (Hugs him.) You’re a published writer! I wish I had a present for you!",
        "Wait a minute! (Quickly checks her pockets and pulls out…) My last Kit-Kat bar!",
        "Okay!!",
        "It’s not mayonnaise!!",
        "Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!",
        "Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!",
        "Well, y’know it’s none of my business, but aren’t you married?",
        "Well, you’re not.",
        "Yeah I can! (Laughs) And don’t think I don’t, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha! (Laughs.)",
        "(giggles) Of course I have! What do you think, I’m some 30 year old virgin?",
        "Say it louder, I don’t think the guy all the way in the back heard you!",
        "It’s not like, I haven’t any opportunities. I mean, y’know, I’m just waiting for the perfect guy. I’m seeing this guy Roger, all right? He’s not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y’know, give him my flower.",
        "Y’know what? You are right?!",
        "Rachel! I’m never gonna think it’s okay for you to cheat on your husband!",
        "Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!",
        "Phoebe! Put that cigarette out!",
        "Put it out!!",
        "(handing her a cup) Here you go sweetie.",
        "But, I put some honey in it.",
        "Well, you used to like playing the guitar.",
        "I hope you’re hungry, we’re starting with oysters. And y’know what they say about oysters, don’t you?",
        "No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.",
        "People! People say it! Come here! (She grabs him and kisses him.)",
        "And then we’re gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.",
        "No-no-no, no! It’s sensual!",
        "Okay! (They kiss again and his beeper goes off.) Ohhh no!",
        "I can’t promise anything. (She starts to dig in.)",
        "Yeah, me too.",
        "Stop it!! That’s not funny!!",
        "I’m sorry, okay? It just—tonight was supposed to be y’know, it was supposed to be a big deal.",
        "You don’t want to know what tonight was.",
        "Well, tonight was—was going to be my first time.",
        "All right relax Mr. I’ve Had s*x Four Times!",
        "How many?",
        "I was just waiting for the perfect guy.",
        "No. He’s not a horrible guy.",
        "Chandler, I’m gonna die a virgin!",
        "Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?",
        "I was kidding.",
        "No! (They both laugh.) Oyster?",
        "Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you’re horrible, how would I know?",
        "It’s harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!",
        "Absolutely! It would just be one friend (Points at Chandler) helping out another friend. (Points at herself.)",
        "Noo!! Okay!!",
        "Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?",
        "I have no moves. (He moves in to kiss her and she laughs and backs away.) Okay, whatcha doin’ there?! (Giggles.) Oh y’know what? I’m sorry, this is just too weird.",
        "What if I turn out the lights? (Runs to shut them off.)",
        "Chandler?",
        "That’s the couch.",
        "I know! I’ll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey, check me out, I’m a slut!",
        "Oh I can’t. Dr. Roger is coming over again.",
        "Are you okay?",
        "Great! It’s so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I’m all like, \"Can the doctor see me now?\"",
        "Y’know, I don’t have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. (He laughs halfheartedly) Are you sure you’re okay?",
        "Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.",
        "What?!",
        "Why would you do that?",
        "Really?",
        "Chandler!",
        "There was just one woman, wasn’t there?",
        "Including me?",
        "What’s the charity?",
        "Does Ralph mumble when you’re not paying attention?",
        "Oh, I like Elizabeth.",
        "Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y’know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.",
        "Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.",
        "Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?",
        "Hey!",
        "(laughs sarcastically) Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Well, uh y’know, our guy works with Chandler and he’s really nice and smart and he’s a great dresser!",
        "You’re not supposed to look!",
        "All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really funny.",
        "Our guy’s a great dancer!",
        "(To Chandler) Do you want our guy to be your guy?",
        "Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?",
        "Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you’re doing frat guys.",
        "And slept with the professor.",
        "Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler’s work!",
        "Uh, would you stop it with that already?!",
        "Are you funny? Tell us a joke!",
        "All right guys stop it. Rachel, we’re very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And y’know what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you.",
        "In 1981 you were 13!",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey!",
        "We’re really glad you decided to meet our guy.",
        "You’re gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet him?",
        "Eldad, this is Rachel.",
        "Okay! Okay! We can take a hint! (They start to leave but run into Phoebe with her guy in tow.) (To Phoebe) What are you doing here?!",
        "No! You can’t do that!",
        "(stopping him) Sit down! We’re winning!",
        "Rachel! Rachel! You haven’t touched Eldad’s hair!",
        "That’s right Patrick, bye-bye!",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "Yes! Why, did you—you forget to make yours?",
        "Okay. (They kiss.) Okay, I can’t wait! This is going to be the best Valentine’s Day ever! (Chandler giggles and exits.) I can’t believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents!",
        "I’m just so excited to make the presents! (Chandler does another sarcastic/scared laugh and leaves.) Shoot!",
        "Sure! Okay, you go first.",
        "Okay! (She takes her present for him and they move over to sit on the couch.)",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!",
        "Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!",
        "Okay, you ready to open yours?",
        "Okay.",
        "Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?",
        "Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See that’s what this is about.",
        "No! No, she doesn’t. Uh Phoebe, what she makes—that’s uh—they’re sock rabbits. They are completely different—Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn’t make it! I’m sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we’re supposed to make the presents!",
        "No-no, it’s not okay! It’s not! I mean you were just… You’re so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Y’know I’m just gonna—I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here (points to the kitchen), and I am going to do anything you want in there! (Points to the bedroom.)",
        "Oops! (Covers its eyes.) Y’know, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?",
        "We have got to wash that! (Referring to the sock bunny.)",
        "Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?",
        "I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!",
        "Oop, your cake is ready!",
        "Who the hell are you?!",
        "The only problem!",
        "Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.",
        "I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.",
        "The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?",
        "You are just the sweetest. (They kiss.)",
        "(not buying it) Uh-huh.",
        "(pointing to the kitchen) Yeah you will! (Points to the bedroom) And, are you kiddin’ me?!",
        "Okay.",
        "I am!! (Enter her room and closes the door behind her.)",
        "Still crying?",
        "Y’know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is s*x.",
        "I don’t know, I’ve never had to use the other one. I’m just saying y’know, if we’re having s*x, he’s not gonna be talking.",
        "Oh, we have some…",
        " What?",
        "(trying not to laugh) Oh my God.",
        " Yes.",
        " Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.",
        " Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.",
        " That's your call.",
        " Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.",
        " They'r alright.",
        " No really, they're OK.",
        " Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.",
        " I'm outa here. [Monica leaves]",
        " Well, what happened?",
        " Was it...",
        "(startled) Ahh! Aren’t you dressed yet?",
        "We’re supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.",
        "Wh?! What about my allergies?!",
        "Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren’t any message you’ve forgotten to give me are there? (Chandler has a disgusted look on his face.) Apparently you’re not very good at it! I…",
        "Y’know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case… (Chandler gets that disgusted look back.) Okay…",
        "You had no right to go out with him.",
        "You sold me out.",
        "Yes you did.  You absolutely sold me...",
        "Did you just flick me?",
        "Fine!",
        "(To Chandler) You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?!",
        "I think our lover’s spat will start a little early this month.",
        "We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.",
        "Ross!!",
        "How crazy that we’d run into you!",
        "(obviously attracted to him) Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?",
        "(sympathetic) Ohh!",
        "Y’know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, ‘cause usually he’s got the children’s hospital.",
        "And he’s a great brother!",
        "Ohh!",
        "No, you said the baby creeps you out.",
        "You said the baby.",
        "Why would the little girl creep you out?",
        "What?! Excuse me!",
        "How was your first day?",
        "Well y’know Joey, you’re a pretty charming guy.",
        "No sweetie, you’ve got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You’ve got to kiss some serious robot ass!",
        "Yeah! That’s why I’m sleeping with him on the side.",
        "Phoebe, stop writing about us!",
        "Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I’ll just write about Phyllis! Hmm!",
        "(writing on a piece of paper) Phyllis is sitting in a chair.",
        "(still writing) Phyllis sees what I’m doing.",
        "Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.",
        "We said six!",
        "Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would’ve said something like this, \"Wow! My boyfriend’s such a wise ass—seven!\"",
        "Ugh!",
        "What time?",
        "Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "What’s the big deal?",
        "Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?",
        "Do you really see this as a long-term thing?",
        "Hi guys.",
        "Oh, thank you! (The gang exhibits signs of quiet apprehension and wears knowing glances.) (Monica giggles.) What’s going on?",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Are you okay?",
        "Yeah. I’m okay. I’m actually—I’m a little cold, can I have your jacket?",
        "(laughs) Are you sure you’re okay?",
        "Ohh that’s sweet!",
        "(interrupting him) Oh my God!",
        "Oh my God, Richard. (Yep, Richard’s back.)",
        "Oh God, maybe he won’t see us. Richard!",
        "Hey, it’s good to see you!",
        "Yeah—Oh that’s right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.",
        "Chandler, wh-why don’t we sit down?",
        "(to Richard) It’s good to see you",
        "And so, we’re hiding in the bathroom.",
        "So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they’re going at it right on the bathroom floor.",
        "Ohh.",
        "I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.",
        "Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can’t get out of!",
        "Why don’t you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that’s what I did when I first (looks at Chandler and pauses) weighing stuff.",
        "If the school finds out you’re fired.",
        "She’s leaving for three months.",
        "Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, \"Do you see a future?\" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? (Ross pauses in consideration.) Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn’t you?!",
        "Okay well I think…that’s your answer.",
        "Why do you want to see my hand?",
        "(suspiciously) Okay. (Exits to carry out Phoebe’s wishes.)",
        "(entering) I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!",
        "(entering) Hi guys!",
        "What are you up too?",
        "Well that’s a little crazy. Although I am y’know glad to hear that you’re branching out on what you look at on the Internet.",
        "Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!",
        "Okay well that’s good to know.",
        "Sure, I love this part! (Starts to look busy.)",
        "Richard!",
        "Ohh… Oh, that’s okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what’s up?",
        "Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?",
        "What uh—What did you—What?!",
        "Y’know you’re really not supposed to be back here!",
        "Oh God… (Starts looking around.) Why don’t they put chairs back here?!",
        "What the… Yes you’re too late! Where was all this three years ago?!",
        "What were you doing in Africa?",
        "Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I… I’m sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.",
        "Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I’m the one that’s making him wait!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Why? Because of the government.",
        "So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don’t really believe that do you?",
        "Yeah, but that’s pigs not people!",
        "Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?",
        "Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!",
        "Y’know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!",
        "Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?",
        "Yeah, it’s great.",
        "I’m just having one of those days where you realize you’re in a dead-end relationship!",
        "It’s not like I want to get married tomorrow! It’s just that I-I’d like to believe that I’m in a relationship that’s actually going somewhere, that I’m not just wasting my time!",
        "No I don’t know Chandler! Not anymore! It’s like it’s like something’s changed.",
        "I didn’t change!",
        "What?!",
        "Is that some kind of boat talk?",
        "What does he think? Does he think I’m just gonna wait around for nothing?",
        "(starts for the door) Well there’s some people who do want to marry me.",
        "Yeah! Richard!",
        "That’s right.",
        "You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he’s a-a complex fellow who’s unlikely to take a wife! That-that he’s against marriage and always will be!",
        "Hi.",
        "I don’t know why I’m here.",
        "I don’t know.",
        "(entering) Chandler is such an idiot!",
        "Yeah, I’ll have a scotch…",
        "(moving over to the couch) Still smoking cigars?",
        "No that’s, that’s okay.",
        "Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.",
        "Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don’t like my new eye doctor.",
        "Edward Nevski?",
        "No.",
        "But getting over was the hardest thing that I’ve ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.",
        "(to the mask) I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!",
        "Oh! (Laughs and points at the mask.) Him.",
        "I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up’s apartment! Y’know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!",
        "Y’know, let’s face it, I’m not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig s*x over lunch, I don’t want that!",
        "Fair? Please don’t even talk to me about fair! Fair would’ve been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would’ve been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!",
        "Nothing. (She backs away a little bit but is still in his arms and looks up at his eyes.) I don’t kn—Umm. I don’t know. Umm…",
        "Y’know, I-I… I have to figure…some st—Y’know, some stuff before I can…",
        "You wanted it to be a surprise.",
        "Chandler… In all my life… I never thought I would be so lucky. (Starting to cry.) As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s a reason why girls don’t do this!",
        "Yes.",
        "I knew you were likely to take a wife!",
        "Come in! Come in! (Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe burst through the door.) We’re engaged!!!",
        "Oh…",
        "(yelling at the top of her lungs) I’m engaged!!!!!! I’m engaged!!!!",
        "I’m getting married!!!! I’m gonna be a bride!!!! (Someone else yells at her.) No, I will not shut up because I’m engaged! (He yells again.) Ohh, big talk! Huh, why don’t you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancée will kick your ass! (Chandler starts to look worried.) Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20!",
        "Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! (Bangs on her class with a spoon to make a toast.) Okay, umm, I just wanna say that…I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. (Chandler clears his throat.) Our special night. I mean it just wouldn’t be my—our-our night, if you all weren’t here to celebrate with me—us—Damnit!",
        "Awww, come on—wait—stop it. Okay, to Monica.",
        "Y’know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.",
        "Okay everybody, let’s go! Let’s go!",
        "(looking at her hand) Y’know what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! (Sees Chandler sitting on the bed.) You’re not getting dressed. (Chandler quietly folds over the comforter on the bed making a spot for her.)",
        "Yeah, but I don’t think we have time.",
        "(lustily) Let’s do it! (She kisses him and they fall back onto the bed.)",
        "(chasing after him) Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don’t worry about it!",
        "Phoebe!",
        "Phoebe! Come on! Let’s go! (Knocks on her door.) Come on! (Phoebe enters with guitar and not ready to go.) Why aren’t you dressed yet?!",
        "(grabs the guitar away from her) No, Phoebe, I’ll tell you what, if you get ready now I’ll let you play it at the wedding.",
        "Fair enough, now go get ready!",
        "I’ll get everybody else (Does so), finally we can start celebrating my—(She gasps and is stopped by the sight of Ross and Rachel making out in the hall.) I’m sorry, uh apparently I’ve opened the door to the past.",
        "(interrupting) Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?",
        "See, I’ve been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I’m only planning on doing this once. So, uh y’know, maybe this is selfish and I’m sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.",
        "No it’s not! No! No! Now it’s about you and Ross getting back together!",
        "See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!",
        "That’s true.",
        "Thunder being stolen!!",
        "Well, we’re still talking about it, aren’t we?",
        "Yes that would be lovely.",
        "Y’know what? I-I think that umm, I don’t feel like going to The Plaza.",
        "No-no, I-I really don’t want to talk about it! I don’t! (To Rachel) Especially with you. (Goes into her room.)",
        "I can’t believe her, y’know it’s just—it’s so typical.",
        "Paris?",
        "Keep talking.",
        "I love you!",
        "(in a French accent) Bonjour, monsieur.",
        "(opening the door) Hi Pheebs, what’s up? (She enters.)",
        "What?!",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, let’s just say it’s not the first time you’ve stolen my thunder.",
        "My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.",
        "It’s all everybody at the party could talk about!",
        "(gasps) We had a caricaturist!",
        "And yet, here we are doing it again.",
        "Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!",
        "I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!",
        "Oh, is that why you did it in the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!",
        "I don’t know! I don’t—maybe you’re feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you’d get married first! Maybe you can’t stand the fact that your formerly fat friend is getting married before you!",
        "(yelling after them) I can’t believe you’re gonna have s*x on my engagement night!!",
        "(outside the door) It’s Monica, open up!",
        "I just wanted to say that I hope you do have s*x tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I’m going to announce that I’m pregnant!",
        "I know why!",
        "Okay! Why?!",
        "What do you mean?",
        "(starting to cry) I’m sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross. (They hug.)",
        "(entering from her room) Oww!",
        "I don’t know, my hand feels weird. I guess it’s because, I’m engaged! (Shows off the ring.) How long before it starts getting annoying?",
        "Okay! (Runs off.)",
        "(returning) Okay! (Sets down a huge 3\" 3-ring binder on the table.)",
        "This baby has got everything. Take y’know, locations for instance. (She opens up the binder to the locations chapter.) First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.",
        "All right, so I haven’t cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.",
        "All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.",
        "A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.",
        "Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!",
        "Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?",
        "Yeah! Roses or Lilies? (Holds up a picture of each.)",
        "Oh my God! It’s like one mind.",
        "Oh dad, really you don’t need to…",
        "Well, at least you’re not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.",
        "Anyway, we’re really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we’ll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. (She and Chandler laugh, but her parents don’t.) What?",
        "What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don’t you?",
        "I don’t believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!",
        "You bought the beach house when I was 23!",
        "What about when I started dating Chandler?",
        "I can’t believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!",
        "I can’t believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?",
        "My parents spent the money for our wedding!",
        "No! No it’s not! It’s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!",
        "How? I don’t have any money.",
        "How much?",
        "Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!",
        "It’s enough for wedding scenario eight.",
        "(To Chandler) How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!",
        "Ah, yeah!",
        "This is the most special day of our lives.",
        "Honey, umm I-I love you, (laughs) but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? (Laughs) Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we’re only gonna get married once.",
        "You-you’re gonna have to put your foot down?",
        "Hey.",
        "Listen umm, I’ve been thinking, it’s not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.",
        "Eh, you work for that.",
        "You do?!",
        "Oh, you’re so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?",
        "You thought about that?",
        "How many kids were we gonna have?",
        "What else did you think about?",
        "(laughs) Y’know what? I-I don’t want a big, fancy wedding.",
        "No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.",
        "Uh-hmm.",
        "I love you. (They kiss.) Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin’ about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.",
        "Oh good.",
        "(on phone) Hello? (Listens) Hold on please. Joey, it’s your mom. (Hands him the phone.)",
        "Wh-what are we gonna tell him?",
        "And I have costumes.",
        "Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?",
        "Still get a discount on wedding dresses?",
        "I’m so happy for you!",
        "What?!",
        "Oooh!",
        "(To Chandler) Hey sweetie.",
        "I can’t tell you. It’s a secret.",
        "Awww. (Kisses him.) But still no.",
        "Really? Okay, so why don’t you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?",
        "If you tell me, I’ll tell you what Phoebe said.",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh my God. He threw up?",
        "Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe’s old massage place is getting fired.",
        "That’s right! You lose sucker!! (Pause) Please still marry me.",
        "Hey! Good, you’re home!",
        "Hey baby. (Kisses him.)",
        "I made you a surprise.",
        "Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I’ve had such a craving for them.",
        "Ross!",
        "No! No. They’re umm… They’re just uh…ground beef smileys. (Holding up one of the shells.)",
        "Excuse me Mr. Mexico.",
        "(trying not to laugh) I’m not laughing.",
        "You’re right. I mean I’m sorry. Yeah, I shouldn’t be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you! (Runs off laughing which gets Chandler laughing.)",
        "(running up to Ross) What happened in Atlantic City?!",
        "(To Chandler) You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.",
        "Oh my God! (Laughing)",
        "I-I already told him everything! (Threateningly) You shush!!",
        "Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls!",
        "It’s hard for some people!",
        "Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!",
        "Ohh, I’m sorry I couldn’t think of any more for Ross!",
        "Y’know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.",
        "No!",
        "I don’t know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! (Ross laughs.) What are you laughing at Pampers? (He stops laughing and glares at her.)",
        "Yeah?",
        "Ohh, absolutely.",
        "Yeah, definitely!",
        "Then, I’d steer clear of Phoebe.",
        "Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Of course! (She mouths, \"I have no idea,\" to the rest of the gang.)",
        "(interrupts him) If someone wants to give us a present, we don’t want to deprive them of that joy.",
        "Oh, I already have one.",
        "Hey, I know what I want!",
        "No, you don’t want this. I want to have your grandmother’s cookie recipe.",
        "Uh-huh, yeah.",
        "I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.",
        "Okay. I’m gonna be the mom that makes the world’s best chocolate chip cookies.",
        "Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?",
        "What?",
        "Wow! That’s great! Dad must really like you, he doesn’t ask just anyone to play.",
        "This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.",
        "Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.",
        "He hates to lose.",
        "What’s wrong Phoebe?",
        "No!! Why didn’t you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!",
        "(To Chandler) This is what happens when you don’t register for gifts!",
        "No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.",
        "Yeah! I bet I can do it.",
        "All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.",
        "You don’t? (Laughs) Well, that’s the difference between a professional and a layman.",
        "Hey! How was sailing?",
        "Hey! How was it?",
        "Oh my God Chandler! I can’t believe it!",
        "You gave my father a lap dance!",
        "Listen, I’m sure that dad doesn’t care. He probably thought this was funny; he’ll be telling this story for years!",
        "I wasn’t escaping.",
        "I was trying to help out a squirrel.",
        "(takes the phone from Ross) Come on. (Answering phone) Hello? (Listens) I’m sorry you have the wrong number. (Listens) (Whispering) Okay, I’ll call you later dad. I love you. (Hangs up.)",
        "Okay, here’s batch 22. Oh, maybe these’ll taste a little like your grandmother’s. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.",
        "Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.",
        "No, just a Friday night.",
        "The ones we had right after you almost threw up.",
        "Well, I’ve tried everything. I give up. I guess I’m not gonna be the mom who makes the world’s best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe.  Kids love that right.",
        "Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother’s? Wouldn’t they have the recipe?",
        "What was her name?",
        "Nestle Tollhouse?!",
        "(grabbing a bag of Nestle Tollhouse chocolate chips) Phoebe, is this the recipe? (Tosses her the bag.)",
        "I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!",
        "What’s the matter?",
        "Oh, my mom called, they’re gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we’re looking for a good picture of us.",
        "That’s not true, there are great pictures of us!",
        "(looking at one) Oh, here’s a great one.",
        "I know, but look at me: all tan.",
        "That’s a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Y’know… (Does the whole hair blowing in the wind model type poses.)",
        "Chandler what do you say?",
        "Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.",
        "Yeah! (They turn to the camera, and Chandler does The Face again.) All right, maybe you don’t have to smile. Let’s try something else. Let’s try umm, try looking sexy.",
        "Or not.",
        "I know. Let’s try a look…of far off…wonderment. Okay, we’ll-we’ll gaze into our future and we’ll think about our marriage and the days to come. (Chandler is still not getting it.) Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say \"Geller and Bing to be married,\" not \"Local woman saves drowning moron!\" (The photographer laughs.) Hey! Don’t laugh at him! He’s my drowning moron!",
        "That’s it! Take it! Take it! Take it!",
        "They can’t all be bad. (To Chandler) Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.",
        "Do you really want to pull at that thread?",
        "(seeing him approach) Hey! There you are!",
        "Are you okay?",
        "What?!",
        "Chandler, what were you thinking?",
        "Chandler?",
        "Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!",
        "Okay. (She opens it up and shows it to them.)",
        "Yeah, we really do!",
        "Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!",
        "Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.",
        "First of all um, I love you both so much and you’re both so important to me…",
        "Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine…",
        "If Phoebe were my maid of honor…",
        "Rachel would be Phoebe’s, I would be Rachel’s, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.",
        "(laughs) Well that’s the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!",
        "Because then I don’t have to!",
        "I’m really not deciding!",
        "Yeah that’s right.",
        "Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today when I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she…she wished me good luck.",
        "No, it’s more like a (sarcastically) good luck.",
        "She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.",
        "Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Oh my God yes! Who is she?",
        "Did you break up with her?",
        "Why?",
        "Fat?!",
        "You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!",
        "Well, apparently she does.",
        "Chandler! (Knocks on the door.) Chandler! I just figured out who you are!",
        "You’re Lewis Posin.",
        "Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?",
        "No! But because he thought I was too faaaaa…. (Chandler emerges, without flushing by the way.) And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y’know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.",
        "No, I know. But y’know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.",
        "It’s pretty clear.",
        "Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’t have to apologize.",
        "All right, I…I have to ask.",
        "Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?",
        "Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?",
        "In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That’s not the point.",
        "Well… That’s not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.",
        "How?",
        "What if I have babies, okay? I mean I’m gonna look different. I’m okay with that, but I’m not sure that you are!",
        "Keep going.",
        "Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?",
        "I love you. (They hug and kiss.)",
        "(entering) Hey, what’s going on?",
        "(gasps) Ohh, wow! That’s great! (Rachel and Monica hug.) Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we’ll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I’m so excited! (Runs out leaving Rachel completely stunned and Phoebe laughing.)",
        "Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and…it bent.",
        "Did the girl ever let you ride it?",
        "Making holiday candy for the neighbors.",
        "I’m gonna hang this basket (Points to the one sitting on the table) on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.",
        "See? This is exactly why I’m making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.",
        "Where you can make out with your assistant.",
        "Oh yeah, what’s the plan?",
        "Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!",
        "Did you two…",
        "Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire…",
        "Okay.",
        "The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!",
        "Joey!!",
        "Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!",
        "They love my candy? Oh man!!! I’ve gotta go make more!! (Starts to do so.)",
        "Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!",
        "(turning a light on) Who is that?!",
        "Hi. Do you know what time it is?",
        "Oh please! (To Chandler) Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.",
        "Umm, listen I am sorry, but I’ll put some out first thing in the morning.",
        "Um-hmm.",
        "Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.",
        "Oh yeah! I saw her walkin’ it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.",
        "Umm, can we see you ride it?",
        "See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And there is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. (To Chandler) Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!",
        "I’m sorry, I can’t help you. See? (Points to her new sign.) Rules are rules.",
        "No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell ‘em?",
        "Some people have been saying its y’know little drops of heaven, but whatever.",
        "(still talking to the woman) All right, I’ll do it just this once! But you can’t tell anybody!",
        "(closing the door) It’s unbelievable! I-I can’t believe that sign didn’t work!",
        "Hmm?",
        "But they like it!",
        "Maybe.",
        "Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man? (Joey laughs but stops when Chandler turns to glare at him.)",
        "Well, they’re just gonna have to wait aren’t they? I’ve only got two hands!!",
        "No! You don’t know the system! There’ll be nobody messing with the system!",
        "(opening the door and frantically) Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!",
        "(To Chandler) Thank you.",
        "Did you smoke?",
        "I’m fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.",
        "She sent the chicken back again?!",
        "Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!",
        "(to the lobster) Lucky b*st*rd! (Throws the lobster in and turns around to face the planet’s most annoying woman, next to Dr. Laura and Kathy Lee Gifford of course. She’s the most annoying female TV character however.) Janice.",
        "I’m fine.",
        "Oh… Uh…",
        "Well, she saw the ring.",
        "Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.",
        "Well, she actually has a boyfriend y’know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.",
        "Huh?",
        "Well, she cornered me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!",
        "Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won’t be so bad.",
        "Oh my God, she’s not gonna like the chicken that night either, is she?!",
        "Really?",
        "So-so you would’ve just lied?",
        "Would it really have been that easy?",
        "Good, so do it Saturday night because we’re going to dinner with her and Clark.",
        "He might still show up.",
        "Is that all?",
        "It’s actually going to be just family.",
        "What are we gonna do?",
        "Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?",
        "(To Chandler) Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren’t they?",
        "Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.",
        "We’ll just…we’ll just let her stay.",
        "Kinda like your barcalounger.",
        "I never stop thinking about it.",
        "Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!",
        "Because Chandler still has feelings for you!",
        "That’s right. That’s right. And that is why you can’t stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn’t come to the wedding.",
        "I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.",
        "Betrothed… (Corrects him)",
        "Hi!",
        "(Offering Ross the skull) Licorice?",
        "Are you gonna dress up as Santa?",
        "No.",
        "About a half an hour.",
        "No.",
        "Bing's weird.",
        "Hey!",
        "Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!",
        "Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.",
        "Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.",
        "I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.",
        "(pulling Chandler away from the Maitre d') You need to give him money.",
        "No, to get a table! Places like this are always shakin’ you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.",
        "You've got to be smooth about it.",
        "How did it go?",
        "It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!",
        "I don't know.",
        "We'd be eating our soup right now.",
        "(sees two people exit) Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!",
        "It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, \"Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!\" I mean, it is so annoying.",
        "Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?",
        "What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?",
        "Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from…Texas.",
        "Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?",
        "Come on Ben.",
        "Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.",
        "(to Chandler) Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (She has a really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling Chandler's beard.)",
        "Yes, is that okay?",
        "No.",
        "It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.",
        "Nobody cares about the Dakotas. (That’s true in so many ways, trust me, I’ve lived in one and been to the other.)",
        "'Cause you invited your assistant.",
        "Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.",
        "Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, (Laughs) but I still do.",
        "All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!",
        "(entering, to Joey and Rachel) Hey, did you guys know that your oven doesn't work?",
        "Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?",
        "Chandler? Can you give me a hand? (Grabs her jacket)",
        "Ross’s apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?",
        "That's my pie!",
        "Uh-oh! Uh-oh!",
        "We left Joey alone with the food! (Walks towards the window and looks out) Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!",
        "Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?",
        "Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!",
        "Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and [Cut to Monica’s apartment] he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.",
        "I'll be right there!",
        "(walks to Phoebe's door) Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!",
        "Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!",
        "Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?",
        "Don't do what?",
        "1250.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Really? I'd say 3 to 4.",
        "When it's your assistant, I would say never.",
        "Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he’s obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers.   What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.",
        "Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.",
        "Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.",
        "Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! (She goes back to Clunkers again) Oooh, I can't leave her!",
        "That's not gonna work.",
        "Hey! I didn't know either.",
        "Yeah, I knew.",
        "Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!",
        "Hi, honey.",
        "What? Why, why would...",
        "That's right, she came back all by herself.",
        "(looking up) Ross, when’s this comet thing start?",
        "Okay, we’ve been out here for two hours and we haven’t seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler’s getting chilly. (She walks over to where Chandler is bundled up in a big coat and shivering.)",
        "She’s sleeping.",
        "Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what’s going to happen to you if you wake me up.",
        "It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.",
        "With a wok? (Chandler’s holding a wok.) I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.",
        "Here, let me make the milk, I’m up anyway.",
        "Okay that does sound like fun.",
        "The second sister dies?!",
        "The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?",
        "Okay, here’s your milk. What do you want to talk about? (She sees that Chandler has fallen asleep and slams the door loudly to wake him up.)",
        "Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I’m sorry. Here. (Hands the mug of milk to him.)",
        "Are you still awake?",
        "You do know that was me who just said that right? (He doesn’t respond and she turns on the light, waking him.) Hey. As long as we’re both up…",
        "What?! What are you doing?!",
        "Yeah. We-we had s*x and then we fell asleep.",
        "Nooo! No, that’s not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked my world! (She turns out the light to go back to sleep.)",
        "What?!",
        "Okay. Okay, I’m ready. Come on big fella!",
        "Give me the good stuff.",
        "Okay, I’m up! I’m up!",
        "That really was some of your best work.",
        "I have to be up in seven minutes.",
        "Really?!",
        "Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I’ll get the furniture polish!",
        "What are you talking about?",
        "You were invited?!",
        "My God, I can’t believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!",
        "Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y’know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn’t have stopped her, there probably wouldn’t even be a wedding to go to.",
        "Joey, that paper’s like a year old!",
        "Hey.",
        "Limited seating?! (Screechingly) I am just one tiny person!",
        "(disgusted) Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That’s not the reason she’s not inviting me!",
        "Joan?",
        "Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn’t invited and you got \"and guest?!\"",
        "Wait a minute, y’know, you’re bringing me!",
        "Why not?!",
        "Because! She’s my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We’re family y’know? Well that’s important to me.",
        "(laughs) We’ll see.",
        "David who?",
        "Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?",
        "What are you doing?",
        "So! He’ll understand!",
        "God, you are so strong.",
        "Limited seating my ass. Let’s see who made the cut. (To the couple sitting to her right.) Hi!",
        "I’m Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?",
        "Used to work with her. Used to! I’m a relative and I didn’t get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!",
        "(to the couple on her left) So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?",
        "Okay, you’re fine.",
        "Here’s Frannie. Hmm, won’t she be happy to see me? (Starts to get up and greet Frannie.)",
        "Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.",
        "Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!",
        "You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! What—Why wouldn’t you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?! (Frannie’s husband walks up.) Stuart!",
        "Oh wait I forgot my wrap.",
        "(entering, carrying a newspaper) Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section…",
        "Look at this. (Hands him the newspaper.)",
        "I can’t believe mom and dad are selling the house!",
        "Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it’s time the velvet ropes came down.",
        "Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria’s Secret catalogues, not a gym!",
        "As much as they love you?",
        "Hey!",
        "That was me and Ross.",
        "Oh that’s a great idea. You’re really good on the phone.",
        "Oh, that’s okay, I can’t wait to see everything again! All of the memories…",
        "I used to love to play restaurant.",
        "Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies! (She goes to the attic.)",
        "Hey guys! Hey!",
        "Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.",
        "(wary) Okay. So, which boxes are mine?",
        "Okay. (Starting to go through them) Oh! A coloring book! (Holding it up.)",
        "(looking through it) Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.",
        "(holding up a glove) Oh, an old glove?",
        "Wow! Look at this! (Picking up a shirt.) I can’t believe I even fit into this shirt! (She holds it up and it reads: Tyrannosaurus Ross.) (She turns it around and looks at it.) Oh, this is yours. (Hands it to Ross.)",
        "(holding up a small cowboy hat) This isn’t mine. (Sets it down and looks at the rest of the boxes.) Hey, this isn’t, this isn’t my stuff! Ugh, Ross! (Grabs and holds up a doll.) These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?",
        "What?",
        "Just mine?",
        "So why-why wasn’t Ross’s stuff ruined? (Pause) And if you say the words medical marvel I’m going to Easy Bake your head!",
        "So wait, Ross’s stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!",
        "I can’t believe this! (Storms out.)",
        "Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. (She picks up some kind of furry thing.) It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don’t even know what it is! Ohh, it’s still soft. (She rubs it against her cheek.) What do you think this is?",
        "How do you think I am?! You’ve wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!",
        "(opening it) What’s this?",
        "(shocked) What?!",
        "Wait, you’re giving me your Porsche, you’re kidding me right?!",
        "All right!",
        "(entering) Hey guys!",
        "Do you guys know what happened to Chandler’s barca lounger?",
        "Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca lounger’s gone?! This is the best day ever! (Runs out.)",
        "Happy birthday!!!",
        "It’s your birthday!",
        "Chocolate-chip pancakes!",
        "They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.",
        "Rach, you’re in a great place in your life. Come on, you’ve got a great job! Good friends…",
        "Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.",
        "I can’t believe you bought this.",
        "All right Rach, for what it’s worth, I think that you’re doing great. I mean y’know let’s face it, no one handles this well.",
        "Weren’t you asked to leave sonny?",
        "Heyyy!! You got the door open!! (Giggles.)",
        "Nooo! (Giggles) Okay. (She tries to pull herself up by Rachel and Joey’s doorknob, but the door opens and she almost falls into the their apartment. She manages to catch herself.) Whoa! (Stands up, unsteadily) Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning (whispering) thirty. (Giggles.) So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. (Pause) I wanna puke on you later!",
        "Noo!!!",
        "Noo!!",
        "Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! (Pause) That they know of.",
        "Really?! You promise?",
        "Okay. I love you so much. (Kisses him.)",
        "What about your breath?! (Breathes on him.)",
        "Okay. I can do that.",
        "Ross, just forget about it. This guy’s got you totally wedged in.",
        "Yay!",
        "(sees someone) Paul!",
        "Phil!",
        "Awwwww… (Giggles.)",
        "All you had to do was buy the card!",
        "Really! That long?! (Chandler slowly turns and looks at her.) (To Chandler) Look all you want, it’s happening!",
        "You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now! (Growls and pulls him into a kiss.)",
        "I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends…",
        "I really like to say that I’m-um… (Pause) Y’know what I’d really like to say? I’m drunk!! (Mrs. Geller pulls the camera down.) That’s right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! (Ross grabs the camera out of his dad’s hands.) And guess what! I’ve been drunk before! And I’ve smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! It’s all okay. It’s okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown up. (Falls over sideways with Ross filming the fall.)",
        "Phoebe, y’know why don’t we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?",
        "Oh man!",
        "He’s gonna eat the cake!",
        "I’m glad you’re here, we have a couple of things to ask you about the wedding ceremony.",
        "Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.",
        "Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading.",
        "Do you mind telling us what it is?",
        "What is DOOL?",
        "Who are they killing off?",
        "Noo!!",
        "She’s my favorite character on DOOL.",
        "And the way she slaps all the time!",
        "Wouldn’t you love to do it just once?! (Raises her hand towards Chandler.)",
        "What is that?",
        "It sounds like it’s coming from across the street.",
        "What?",
        "Nooo!!",
        "No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! (She looks through the window and sees Ross practicing and fumbling around with the pipes.) Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!",
        "He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It’s not even a song!",
        "Do you want some shortbread? Eh that’s Scottish like you are.",
        "No! No-no they’re not. They’re still very angry! But y’know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.",
        "(interrupting) You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!",
        "(entering with Rachel) Oh my God! It’s true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?",
        "Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?! (Points to her cheek.)",
        "(breaks away) Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute! (To Cecilia) Umm, you’re a stupid bitch.",
        "Nice to meet you! My God you’re great!",
        "What about the second minister we met with? I kinda liked him.",
        "Come on! It wasn’t that bad!",
        "All right, what about the third guy?",
        "Can you blame him?",
        "Well then we still have a problem.",
        "Well, we’re trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they’re all either boring or annoying or y’know, can’t stop staring at the ladies. (Points to her chest.)",
        "Phoebe, we’re getting married, married; not sixth grade married.",
        "Are you serious?",
        "We’re never gonna find anybody.",
        "Joey look it’s really sweet…",
        "That is true.",
        "It might be kinda cool.",
        "Hey Pheebs, how’s it going?",
        "Oh, I’m sorry. Can I get you something?",
        "Here, take a couple of these. (She gets up to grab a couple of pills.)",
        "It’s Hexadrin.",
        "Okay, while we’re waiting for these pills to kick in, I’m gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. (Phoebe gets up and goes with her.) Get some nice soft pillows under your head, I’m gonna turn the TV on and you can watch whatever you want. And I’m—Sit down—(She sits down on the couch)—gonna make you some tea. And then, I’m gonna rub your feet.",
        "Hexadrin. (She gets the box out of her purse.)",
        "No Phoebe, those are like the side effects and stuff.",
        "Y’know, the possible side effects.",
        "Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!",
        "In case it happens.",
        "You did it! You got ordained?!",
        "Phoebe, your liver is right here. (She points to the right side of her torso.)",
        "Yeah!",
        "Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!",
        "How about receiving?",
        "It doesn’t say that!",
        "There you go!",
        "No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy thought that I was Ross’s mom.",
        "And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much…",
        "(standing outside) Cute PJ’s! You’re really livin’ it up here in London huh?",
        "(entering) Is Joey here?",
        "Wouldn’t you be?",
        "Really?",
        "Well, not anymore.",
        "I know, I just thought it would be fun.",
        "Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.",
        "Okay!",
        "(breaking the kiss) Y’know what’s weird?",
        "This doesn’t feel weird!",
        "You’re a really good kisser.",
        "Hm-hmm!",
        "Wow! You are really fast!",
        "We’re gonna see each other naked.",
        "Do you wanna do it at the same time?",
        "One!",
        "Two!",
        "Eh, we weren’t that close anyway!",
        "Okay, can we change the topic? Because it’s really doing nothing for me.",
        "What?!",
        "Okay, fine but please don’t be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted…just s*x. So, when I…went to your room that night…I was actually looking…for Joey. (Joey smiles.)",
        "No, because it-it didn’t seem important.",
        "Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I fell in love with!",
        "Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!",
        "Wait Chandler come on, let’s—it’s not a big deal!",
        "Hey-hey.",
        "Yeah baby! (Phoebe and Joey nod.)",
        "Honey! Dinner’s ready!",
        "Your favorite!",
        "Yep! And lot’s of it!",
        "Okay, in we go.",
        "Wait a minute, she isn’t… She’s not the one who you…",
        "Wow!",
        "(To Joey) They were lovers.",
        "(telling Chandler the seating arrangement) Okay, so this is where the band is. (Points.) And this is where the bar is. (Points) And all these pins have people’s names on them. (She has pins to show the seating at each of the tables.) And Rach, here you are. (Points to Rachel’s place.)",
        "(To Chandler) Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.",
        "Chandler, relax it’s not a contest. (To Rachel) Certainly not a close one.",
        "Okay, I think that’s it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they’re having fun don’t they?",
        "Oh! (Gets up) Let’s see, well…if this is the wedding hall then umm (Walks away) you’re parents will be at home in Queens.",
        "Why would they think they’re invited?",
        "Joey!",
        "Ross’s parents are my parents!",
        "Oh please, you just want more blue pins.",
        "All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!",
        "Hey. Oh good-good you’re here! All right, I figured it out. I’m gonna take two tables of eight, I’m gonna add your parents, and I’m gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!",
        "(looking at him) What?!",
        "Oh that’s too bad. It’s true, but too bad.",
        "Oh Joey!",
        "No she hasn’t.",
        "Well, what am I going to say?",
        "(on phone) Hello? (Listens) Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? (Listens) Hi, this is Monica Geller. (Listens) Yeah I’m just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren’t delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! (Joey nods his approval.) (Listens) T-Tell me about it! (Listens) Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! (Listens) What, are they Irish?! (Joey gives her a thumbs up.)",
        "Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.",
        "What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!",
        "007 has a fancy car!",
        "007 gets all the ladies.",
        "How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I’ll make you a nice martini.",
        "How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?",
        "Hey.",
        "The show?!",
        "Have you ever been to one of my weddings?",
        "The wedding starts at six.",
        "You’ll vamp?!",
        "You just carry that around?",
        "Between you and…",
        "A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.",
        "All right that’s it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom to stand at the altar and scream racial slurs? I don’t care!",
        "(defeated) Oh.",
        "So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.",
        "Chandler.",
        "I will.",
        "No, I’ll do it. You just stick to your job.",
        "There were only twelve.",
        "What are peanut butter fingers?!",
        "This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I can’t believe I found it!",
        "Well I’m Monica Geller, ball like a baby.",
        "Have you found your dress yet?",
        "No, I can’t afford this either. No. I-I-I’m, I’m just here to figure out which one I want then I’m gonna get it at Kleinman’s, this discount place in Brooklyn, day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale.",
        "Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?",
        "Oh May 15th.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Jeffery.",
        "The best man? Wow!",
        "Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.",
        "All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what you’re looking for! (Holds up a picture of it.) Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? (She passes out whistles to them.) Three short blasts. When you hear it, come running.",
        "All right.",
        "(To Rachel) Hey! Don’t be a baby!",
        "No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. (Checks another rack and another woman tries to reach around her.) (To the woman) Don’t crowd me! (Finds it) This is it! This is the dress! Oh my God, it’s perfect! (She takes it off of the rack and someone has a hold of it on the other side of the rack and tugs on it.) I’m sorry, this one’s taken! (The other woman tugs harder pulling Monica through the rack.) Whoa!",
        "Megan!",
        "You came?!",
        "This is my dress!",
        "Yes it is! You saw me wearing it!",
        "What? You freak! You wouldn’t even have known about this place if it wasn’t for me!",
        "Maybe I do! I’m pretty feisty! (She blows the signal.)",
        "(handing Phoebe the dress) Go! Go! Go!",
        "NOW!!!!!!!! (Rachel runs off and Monica gets up to follow her.)",
        "Oh…",
        "Hello? (Listens) What?! (Listens) You what?! (Listens) Hey you listen here missy! (Listens) Wh—(She is hung up on.)",
        "That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn’t have them back unless I gave her the dress!",
        "What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh…Chandler wants the band. What do I do?",
        "How?",
        "Phoebe, he’s gotta be in the room for that to work.",
        "Well umm, we were just talking about the y’know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y’know, they were the right way to go.",
        "Oh crap!",
        "(from the bedroom) Don’t come in here!",
        "No! We only mess around at his place!",
        "No, I’m wearing a wedding dress.",
        "Yeah but I’m not keeping it.",
        "Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can’t like it.",
        "Really?",
        "Oh because it doesn’t…really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings.",
        "Okay! But you can’t rip it. Well, maybe a little.",
        "(entering) Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding? (They ignore her.) Guys?",
        "Alright, what’s going on?",
        "I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone. (She heads for the bedroom.)",
        "Joey!",
        "Congratulations! Wow! I can’t believe you’re nominated for an Emmy!",
        "Oh Soap Opera Digest award!",
        "Honey? Is that something you’re making up?",
        "(to Joey) Okay, I’ll go!",
        "Really? (Looks.) My God, he’s really cute.",
        "Phoebe, I’m engaged!",
        "Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I’m engaged. (Points to her ring.)",
        "Well you should be embarrassed. (Leaves.)",
        "Hey! How’d your date go with Jake?",
        "Okay, stop it Phoebe, you’re getting me all tingly.",
        "And did he?",
        "Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.",
        "Oh, I haven’t had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I’m never gonna have that feeling again am I?",
        "No, a guy would be saying, \"I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else.\" Oh my God! I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I’ve been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I’d be giving up! I mean, I…I’m never gonna have a first kiss again.",
        "Phoebe, it’s okay. You don’t have to tip toe around me. I-I’ve been thinking about it and umm, y’know what? I’m okay about not having that new relationship feeling…",
        "See? That’s what I mean. I mean that, that’s great! But I wouldn’t trade in what I have for that. I mean I’m gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and that’s what makes me happy. (Chandler approaches.) Hey sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is don’t you think?",
        "Have you seen Chandler?",
        "‘Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I’m not gonna have and it’s freaking me out. I don’t know what to do about it.",
        "Phoebe! Come on I’m serious! I just got to talk to him about all this.",
        "Why?",
        "You gotta help me out here Pheebs.",
        "So I’m not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I’m gonna spend the rest of my life with?",
        "Your mother told you this?",
        "The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?",
        "Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?",
        "You’re wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?",
        "Doesn’t it ever just freak you out that-that you’re never gonna be with anybody new again?",
        "Just, I love you so much. Just…It’s just sometimes it bothers me that I’m never gonna have that feeling. Y’know when you meet someone for the first time and it’s new and exciting? Y’know that rush?",
        "Okay, but all right you’re a guy, does it not freak you that you’re never gonna sleep with anybody else?",
        "Even with me?",
        "Really?",
        "Come here! Come here! (They hug.) Sweetie you don’t have to worry. No, besides y’know what? I’m gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid…",
        "What was it for?",
        "Wow!",
        "Yeah. But a part of me also can’t wait ‘til it’s over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have s*x again until the wedding.",
        "Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?",
        "I gotta make up the guest bedroom. (To Ross) Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us for a few days.",
        "Uh-hmm.",
        "Ross, she’s 25 years old.",
        "Hey!",
        "Subtle guys!",
        "I know you’re planning my surprise bridal shower.",
        "Okay. Sorry. (She goes into the guest bedroom.)",
        "Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?",
        "That’s what you say about p0rn.",
        "No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean, the chance to star in a movie? Come on!",
        "Plus, everyone’s gonna see your thing. (Giggles.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh boy, me too!",
        "Yeah?",
        "The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!",
        "Okay. (They both jump up to head for their room, but Monica stops.) But wait, we can’t. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we’re supposed to have lunch.",
        "Shrill?! The wedding is back on!",
        "So, are you ready to go?",
        "(catching him) Chandler!",
        "(To Ross) Cassie needs to stay at your place.",
        "Because Purvy Perverson over here can’t stop staring at her.",
        "You were staring about eight inches south of there.",
        "She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.",
        "Wafer thin ice!",
        "So to get this part you can’t be?",
        "But you are?",
        "But you told them you weren’t?",
        "Wow! Wow! And it’s definitely all gone? There’s nothing there to work with? (Joey glares at her.) What were you thinking?",
        "Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to…grow a turtleneck!",
        "Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!",
        "Unless!",
        "Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.",
        "Well I’m not sure yet, but umm, off the top of my head I’m thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Well uh, I’m trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?",
        "Okay. (Opens the fridge.) All right, turkey. Eh, that won’t work. Cheese? (Picks it up) That won’t work. Olive loaf? (Picks it up) I hope that won’t work.",
        "No it’s umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I’m gonna go guys.",
        "I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present! (Runs out.)",
        "Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.",
        "Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. (Points to it.) Umm, this one is made of bologna. (Points.)",
        "Oh, just until the glue dries.",
        "(to a whole group) Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.",
        "Okay? (To a different group) Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it’s gonna shrink.",
        "I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that’s really just for me. (Rubs it against her cheek.) Okay. So, why don’t you go into your room and try these on and we’ll see—get a better idea of what’s gonna work.",
        "Toothpick?",
        "What are you trying on now?",
        "And?",
        "Joey!",
        "What?! Which one?!",
        "Phoebe! Rachel! It’s Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! (She bursts into the apartment to find only Phoebe and Rachel sitting on the couch.) Oh.",
        "For what?",
        "You al-you already had it?",
        "Well no, wait a minute, that’s not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.",
        "Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents (Motions to the pile in the corner) without having to talk to people I don’t even like!",
        "Do you realize that four weeks from today we’re getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!",
        "There’s still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?",
        "Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.",
        "No! But I know exactly what I’m going to say.",
        "(handing him a pad of paper and a pen) Let’s just do it right now. Okay? It won’t be hard. Just say what’s in your heart. (She goes back, sits down, and starts feverishly writing.)",
        "You have to help me! I’m supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this! (Shows them what she’s been working on.)",
        "Thank you.",
        "Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts. (Points.)",
        "Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.",
        "Ennnh.",
        "Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!",
        "Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. (She starts labelling them) You got one, two three, four (Chandler is shocked to find out there’s more than three), five, six, and seven!",
        "It’s kind of an important one!",
        "All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, (Rachel starts getting worked up) 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7 …7..…7…7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7…(mouths 7)! (They both lean back on the couch satisfied.)",
        "No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?",
        "Oh yeah? When?",
        "Why won't I be married when I'm 40?",
        "Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?",
        "What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriageable about me?",
        "Well?",
        "(Comes up for below the covers and looks concerned.) Do you think he knew I was here? (Chandler quickly looks at Monica not knowing what to say.)",
        "Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)",
        "Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)",
        "I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)",
        "What?",
        "You said you loved me! I can't believe this!",
        "Yes, you did!",
        "You love me!",
        "Then all your stuff would be here.",
        "Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn’t make any sense.",
        "You wanted it to be a surprise.",
        "Chandler… In all my life… I never thought I would be so lucky. (Starting to cry.) As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s a reason why girls don’t do this!",
        "Yes.",
        "Come in! Come in! (Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe burst through the door.) We’re engaged!!!",
        "Chicken? I could eat some chicken.",
        "Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!",
        "Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.",
        "(on phone) I can't wait to be with you!  I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.",
        "(on phone) Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big…",
        "Bye!",
        "Actually, I did!",
        "Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!",
        "Them?! Who's them?",
        "Joey!",
        "Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But, see, they don't know that we know that they know! So…",
        "She's bluffing!",
        "You go back out there, and you seduce her till she cracks!",
        "Of course.",
        "I love you too, Chandler. (They kiss.)",
        "Well actually, Ross doesn't.",
        "Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.",
        "Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?",
        "Hey, you guys!",
        "Oh that’s so sweet.",
        "Yeah, I don’t hear Chandler’s and he doesn’t hear mine.",
        "Chandler!!",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah, well he’s my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.",
        "Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you’re done.",
        "Nice work everybody! So much for the y’know, \"You can drive it, but don’t tell Rachel\" plan!",
        "Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won’t let you drive the Porsche is because you’re a terrible driver. There! That wasn’t about the wedding.",
        "Chandler, we still haven’t gotten an RSVP from your dad.",
        "Chandler! He’s your father; he should be at the wedding.",
        "Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn’t even asked?!",
        "So what! As long as he’s not wearing a white dress and a veil I don’t care.",
        "Here! (She sets a bag down in front of him.)",
        "It’s your suitcase. We’re going to Las Vegas.",
        "We’re going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It’s time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.",
        "No you didn’t. Oh and honey, just so you know, now that you’re marrying me, you don’t get to win anymore.",
        "Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know…",
        "Hey, the point is that he was at every one of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That’s a, that’s a pretty great dad.",
        "Who’s Mr. Garibaldi?",
        "Chandler, you’re not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it’s time that you let that stuff go. If your father’s not at your wedding…you’re gonna regret it for the rest of your life.",
        "Yes!",
        "How much did ever really win before?",
        "Uh oh yeah, she did. Uh, he did. (To Chandler) She? (To the waiter) I’m-I’m sorry I’m new. I don’t…",
        "I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.",
        "Why not?!",
        "What?!",
        "That can’t be your father.",
        "What?",
        "Relax! You’ll be fine. (Chandler exhales and turns off the table light.) Oh much better. You’re invisible now.",
        "Can we have our drinks please?! Waiter—Uh, tress!",
        "I’m-I’m Monica.",
        "New York.",
        "(looks at Chandler) In…in two weeks.",
        "(To Chandler) You okay?",
        "Do you realize this is probably the last time we’ll all be here in the coffee house as six single people?",
        "Old?",
        "That’s much better.",
        "We’re gonna pick up the wedding dress, then we’re gonna have lunch with mom. (Joey stands up.)",
        "I’m making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared.",
        "Well, so far I have uh, my bridesmaids' dresses won’t get picked up, my veil gets lost, or I don’t have my something blue.",
        "I had to go with the odds Rach.",
        "That other play?",
        "Wait! Wait! Wait! You can’t start today! Today’s the rehearsal dinner!",
        "Oh. Well then way to go, you big movie star!",
        "Who did we fight in World War I?",
        "Honey, we gotta go!",
        "(laughs) I don’t have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does.",
        "Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow we’ll be getting married?",
        "I just, I can’t believe that we made it!",
        "I’m sorry but…nothing.",
        "Well…honestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to.. to flip you out.",
        "Really?",
        "Ohh, I’m so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean it’s really, it’s made me stay calm. (Chandler just looks at her.) I coulda been worse!",
        "(voice on answering machine) Hi! If you’re calling before Saturday, you’ve reached Monica and Chandler. But if you’re calling after Saturday, you’ve reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!",
        "Hey Maureen! (They hug.) Gosh! Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin Maureen.",
        "What is that?",
        "Mrs. Bing? Here, these are my parents umm, Judy and Jack Geller.",
        "Dad! There’s Ross (points), why don’t you go talk to him?",
        "Hi Mr.…Bing.",
        "It-it’s so great to see you both here.",
        "Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would you talk to Chandler’s dad and try to keep him away from Chandler’s mom?",
        "He is the man in the black dress.",
        "All right, I’m gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?",
        "Who wants it? Anybody?",
        "Nobody wants to do it? All right, I’ll do it myself.",
        "Y’know what? You’re right, I’m sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.",
        "Okay. Sorry. (Monica goes into the bathroom.)",
        "(entering from her room, excitedly) I’m getting married today!!! (She trips and falls.) (Getting up) I think I just cracked a rib. But I don’t care because today’s my wedding day! My day is finally here!! (Runs back into her room.)",
        "(re-entering) I’m gonna start getting ready! (Goes back into her room.)",
        "Hey! Okay, so I thought we’d start with my make up and then do my hair.",
        "About what?",
        "Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?",
        "Any woman would be lucky to have ya.",
        "(jumping up) Rachel! You okay?",
        "(interrupting) The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel I’m sorry! I have to start getting ready! I’m getting married today!",
        "(getting up) I’m gonna go put my make-up on, we have to be at the hotel in an hour! (Starts for the bathroom.)",
        "What?!",
        "I can’t go to lunch!!",
        "(entering) What’s going on?",
        "Okay, you’re-you’re really freaking me out.",
        "How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!",
        "Oh wow! Okay. Don’t scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like, \"Oh my God! The worst has happened!\"",
        "I wanna wear this everyday.",
        "(starting to cry) I’m so happy for me.",
        "I know! Hey, how’s Chandler doin’?",
        "Are you okay?",
        "Well, you’re-you’re sweating.",
        "Oh that’s sweet. Don’t touch me.",
        "She’s right there.",
        "Not now.",
        "(To Chandler) Who is this?",
        "(To Rachel) He took off?",
        "Chandler, for so long I…I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And instead, I found everything that I’d ever been looking for my whole life. And now…here we are…with our future before us…and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don’t want to. You go!",
        "I do.",
        "What baby?",
        "We have a baby?",
        "I didn’t take a pregnancy test.",
        "Okay.",
        "Guys! I’m not pregnant.",
        "You didn’t tell anybody I was did you?!",
        "(To Joey) Oh, about that. Joey, you have to change before the party.",
        "Find some! Please! Anything that doesn’t say I-I died tragically in France. (Joey leaves to find clothes.)",
        "Because I’m not.",
        "What are you talking about?",
        "Wait a minute! So you told people I was pregnant?! (Flash) Does this look like a conversation that I want to remember?!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Why?!",
        "Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.",
        "Honey, I’m going to put my hand in your pocket!",
        "No.",
        "What?!",
        "Oh that is so sweet!",
        "Yes.",
        "What’s the matter?",
        "Well, are you going to be able to do this?",
        "Well, the good news is, I don’t think anyone’s looking at us.",
        "(seeing him) Oh sweet Lord.",
        "Honey, I’m not even going to pretend I was listening. (Sees someone else.) Hey! Hey! (Goes over to that person.)",
        "Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!",
        "This is so huge.",
        "Of course not nothing is. Between me and you…",
        "…in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?",
        "How?",
        "Well I-I talked to and uh, she’s definitely going to have this baby. Y’know, she said she was gonna raise it on her own.",
        "Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard it’s gonna be.",
        "Well, there’s a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize she’s not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?",
        "Are you okay?",
        "Oh really?!",
        "(interrupting) Rachel’s really the one who’s pregnant.",
        "How do you feel?",
        "Yes! Maybe it’s a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the stick right?",
        "You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me.",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh, wait a minute! Who’s is the father?!",
        "Oh, come on it’s my wedding! That can be my present.",
        "Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?",
        "Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, you’ll be fine. (She starts to walk towards the floor.)",
        "Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me. (Chandler grunts.) Okay, you can easily embarrass me. But come on, it doesn’t matter. All right? I married you! So I want to dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on. (They go onto the floor.) Just try not to move your feet at all. (Chandler starts to get into the groove and bust a move.) There you go.",
        "(entering) Did I miss it? (Phoebe nods no.) Rachel, I-I want you to know that, if it’s positive, we’re gonna…",
        "Go ahead Rach.",
        "Well… Well, great.",
        "Oh God…",
        "Are you really gonna do this?",
        "(depressed) That’s right. I’m no longer a bride. I’ll never be a bride again. Now, I’m just someone’s wife!",
        "Oh yeah, right. (Rolls her eyes.)",
        "That’s not ‘til Thursday.",
        "They won’t be ready for weeks.",
        "That’s true! (Happily) I knew I married you for a reason!",
        "Okay.",
        "Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.",
        "Oh thanks. (Reading the bill) Champagne, strawberries…Oh my God! I can’t believe Chandler ordered p0rn on our wedding night!",
        "Hey!",
        "No! (Pause) But, they’re callin’ out to me! I mean this little guy (Holds up a small one) even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldn’t mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?",
        "A tiny salt shaker!!!",
        "Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.",
        "Good. Okay, I’m just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of them.",
        "Whew. Although y’know, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I mean… I guess y’know it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?",
        "Or this one! (She grabs and starts to open the biggest present.)",
        "Hey, how are you feelin’? Any morning sickness?",
        "No! Joey and Ross don’t know anything and Chandler still thinks that Phoebe’s pregnant.",
        "Wow. Y’know it is so weird. I mean, you’re gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea what’s gonna happen.",
        "What was that bam?",
        "Who’s David Lynn?",
        "No! No! I shouldn’t have even opened these! I mean I—Joey I am out of control!! Joey, you have to do me a favor. No matter what I say, no matter what I do, please do not let me open another present! Okay?",
        "Give me one more.",
        "Oh my God! Joey!",
        "You can’t marry him!",
        "Phoebe!",
        "She’s not pregnant. It’s Rachel. Rachel’s the one who’s pregnant.",
        "Phoebe I think he would notice if you didn’t have a baby in nine months!",
        "There’s a dude?",
        "People have got to finish their stories!",
        "(throwing up the last present) I don’t know how any of these got opened?!",
        "I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!",
        "Yeah. What is that?",
        "Hey! How’d it go?",
        "So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?",
        "What?!",
        "Great! We’re hangin’ in the kitchen! (She drags him into the kitchen and turns his back to the living room) Let’s stay in the kitchen!",
        "Wow! That is a great picture!",
        "Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags! (Throws them into his chest.)",
        "That would be a good idea.",
        "You kissed another woman!",
        "Okay! (They high-five and he walks out.)",
        "Yeah I am!",
        "That’s right. Get it out of your system while we’re alone.",
        "Oh no, I already packed. The only thing I couldn’t find though was your Speedo.",
        "Hey!",
        "Thank you.",
        "This is so great! And I’m gonna be your baby’s aunt!",
        "Yeah, but I’m the only one related by blood.",
        "Well, what were you gonna say?",
        "Hey! Good luck!",
        "Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are gonna have a baby.",
        "I didn’t think you could keep it a secret.",
        "They’re kissing let’s just go around them.",
        "I’m in love too! But in an orderly fashion.",
        "(to the couple) Hi! Can you do that and walk? ‘Cause she said, \"Next.\"",
        "(To Chandler) Did you hear that?! They bumped them up to first class because they are on their honeymoon! Come on! Let’s act like we’re on our honeymoon.",
        "Grab my ass!",
        "Hi, sorry. I almost didn’t hear you, because y’know I’m just so in love with my new husband. We’re on our honeymoon.",
        "Oh no, you see we’re on our honeymoon. So umm, can you do your little thing and bump us up to first class?",
        "You see, if we’d gone around them like I said, we—She would’ve given us those tickets. Damnit!",
        "Look at that! Look at that! They’re going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?",
        "Me neither! We have to get in! (She runs through the door with Chandler in tow.)",
        "Oh my God! Oranges!",
        "Fine. (Starts to walk away then she runs over and grabs an orange before she exits.) Go! Go! Go!",
        "I can’t believe we’re here.",
        "What? (Monica sees the first couple and gasps.)",
        "No!! You have been screwing us all day!",
        "Yeah! You already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge! I mean we should get free stuff too! I mean you’re not the only ones on your honeymoon!",
        "What? Are you serious?! (To Chandler) Joey smells gas!",
        "Well do something! Get in there!",
        "Yeah! Do that!",
        "No! (Pause) Are you doing it?! I don’t hear anything! Come on!",
        "Okay, now this one is rare, this one is medium well! Now go-go-go! (Phoebe enters) Hey Phoebe!",
        "Hey how was dinner?!",
        "Okay!",
        "Okay!",
        "Uh Tim? This is Phoebe. Phoebe this is Tim, my new sous chef.",
        "Hey Tim? I need a calamari and a Caesar salad. And umm, could you get me the pesto?",
        "All right, I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad.",
        "All right, all right! Let’s just cut to the chase, okay? (To Phoebe) You’re single. (To Tim) You’re single. (To Phoebe) He gets off work at eleven. (To Tim) She’ll be waiting for your call. (To Phoebe) I’ll give him your number if I can get one calamari and one Caesar salad!! (Everyone in the kitchen stops.) I did not yell. I am not putting a dollar in the jar.",
        "Hi!",
        "I…I have to fire him.",
        "Because he’s terrible! Okay, he’s slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!",
        "Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished.",
        "(thinks about it) All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!",
        "I paid to have this done.",
        "Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!",
        "No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, \"Ha-ha! Gotcha!\"",
        "Why not?!",
        "What?! You said he was sweet!",
        "Just don’t pick up your phone.",
        "What? So now I’m not allowed to fire him?",
        "Okay well then, I’ll fire him today and you go out with him for another week.",
        "Okay well, then we’ll both do it today and he’ll just have to deal with it!",
        "What do you mean?",
        "I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.",
        "Hey.",
        "Uh well that depends, how are things with Phoebe?",
        "Oh my pleasure. Okay, I’m afraid I’ve got some bad news. (Phoebe enters.) Phoebe!",
        "(simultaneously) You’re fired!",
        "You’re fired.",
        "Yeah and-and I’m sorry too. But, well I just—I like things done a certain way and the chemistry’s just not right.",
        "Tim wait!",
        "Umm, I think I spoke too quickly. There-there’s a learning curve with this job and maybe we can try it again.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Okay.",
        "(recognizing him and panicking) No you don’t!",
        "I’m sorry, they surprised me. There was nothing I could do!",
        "Ugh, I knew giving you that book was gonna come back and bite me in the ass!",
        "(entering) Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight you’re gonna have a bachelor party.",
        "Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!",
        "Come on! Come on, it’ll be fun! It’ll make me feel so much better.",
        "So don’t think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as a…a two month anniversary present.",
        "Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!",
        "Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?",
        "Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girl’s number.",
        "My husband.",
        "She’s a stripper.",
        "Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?",
        "Oh my God Stu! I-I can’t believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure she’s a hooker?",
        "(entering quickly) She’s a hooker! She’s a hooker! She’s a… (Stops as she sees her.) Hi! Uh, we spoke on the phone. (Goes and shakes the hooker’s hand.)",
        "I swear I didn’t know she was a hooker! I mean wh—Did you let her smoke in here?",
        "Y’know what? I’m gonna make this up to you. I promised you a stripper (turns on the radio), and you’re gonna get a stripper. (She starts to strip.)",
        "What?",
        "Ooh, these tennis shoes are so tight. I think I’ll take them off. (Goes to do so.)",
        "Gotcha sailor. (Kicks one of her shoes off and it lands in the kitchen knocking something down, but she continues to strip.)",
        "Hey you guys?",
        "I know it’s last minute, but we decided to have a Halloween party.",
        "And everybody has to wear costumes. (And there’s general disconcertment.) Come on! It’ll be fun!",
        "You have to!",
        "So Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?",
        "Wait! You’re supposed to wear a costume!",
        "Oh.",
        "I’m Catwoman, who wants to borrow the dress when you’re too big for it.",
        "So we do Supergirl.",
        "What?! I thought he’d love it! His favorite kid's book was the Velveteen Rabbit!",
        "Well, it was either a pink bunny or no bunny at all.",
        "You didn’t dress up either?!",
        "What?! There’s only been like four kids.",
        "What are you supposed to be?",
        "No, space doody!",
        "Hey Joey?",
        "You read comic books right?",
        "Who do you think would win in a fight, Catwoman or Supergirl?",
        "Yeah…",
        "What?! Really?!",
        "No you’re fine. (Joey checks anyway.) All right well, do you think I could take Rachel?",
        "What?! Come on I am tough! Punch me right here! (Her stomach) As hard as you can!",
        "Oh really? Okay? Well what would you say if I told you that, y’know, Ross or Chandler could beat you up?",
        "Oh my God, Phoebe!",
        "You’re getting a crush on your sister’s fiancée.",
        "I can’t answer that! Chandler’s my husband.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Ross is really strong! Okay, he’s the strongest out of all three of you! (Joey looks at her.) Except for Joey.",
        "Wait-wait!! Okay, stop it! Stop it! Stop! (Breaks it up.) Now listen, no one’s gonna fight in this apartment.",
        "(To Chandler) Look honey, you don’t have to do this, okay? It’s the strength you have inside that means the most to me. You’re loyal, you’re honest, and you have integrity! That’s the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!",
        "(To Phoebe) Oh God!",
        "Chandler’s making his s*x face.",
        "Look, I wanted to tell I’m-I’m sorry you lost.",
        "(laughs) Is that a secret or a lie.",
        "Chandler please!",
        "Let’s go big bunny!",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh my God! You cleaned! (Gasps) Look at these floors! You did the windows! Oh, I have been begging you for months and you did! You cleaned! And nagging works!",
        "Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?",
        "Well then who?",
        "(shocked) I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then…",
        "Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!",
        "Did she really say that?",
        "Fine, I can do it. (Gets anxious.) Whew.",
        "Well, usually when I’m this anxious, I clean!",
        "Oh well umm, I make it myself! It’s two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice. And now the secret ingredient is…y’know what? We just met.",
        "(To Chandler) I love her.",
        "Okay. (As Brenda exits Monica notices something.)",
        "She stole my jeans!",
        "I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!",
        "Don’t you see? It’s the perfect crime!",
        "I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!",
        "I guess.",
        "Fine. I’m just glad I didn’t give her my secret ingredient.",
        "Yeah! (Laughs.)",
        "Nice jeans!",
        "Oh. (Holds on to it.) (To herself) You’re not gettin’ it.",
        "Oh, I fell asleep.",
        "Oh, will you do the top of the cabinets? That’ll really work up your appetite for lunch.",
        "Hello.",
        "I’m sorry. I’ve never had a maid before, is this not okay?",
        "Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.",
        "Because I put my head between her legs.",
        "They’re my pants!",
        "No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.",
        "Fine. (Brenda comes in to use the bathroom and adjusts her pink bra strap on the way.) She’s wearing my bra!",
        "My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!",
        "Here’s the plan! Okay? I’m going to leave you get a look at Brenda’s bra!",
        "I would do it but she thinks I’m attracted to her!",
        "Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on we’re a team! We’re in this together!",
        "Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at woman’s breasts all the time!",
        "Do you see this? (Mimics him drooling over a woman’s breasts.)",
        "Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, you’ll know it’s mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, there’s a very noticeable rip.",
        "(looking at Rachel’s jeans) Where did you get those jeans?!",
        "No I didn’t!",
        "Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!",
        "The pink one with the flowers?!",
        "Sounds about right.",
        "Hey! So what do you think?",
        "Yes! Now, they’re a little more than I normally spend on boots…or rent (Shows him the receipt.)",
        "I know.",
        "I’m sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman was looking at me like, \"Oh, these are way too expensive for you.\"",
        "Hey.",
        "They’re mine!",
        "Honey, I’m not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost a lot, but I’m going to wear them all the time. You’ll see. Besides, I love the compliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?",
        "Nice try; I’m keeping the boots.",
        "Hey guys!",
        "Hey. (Sits down on the arm of the couch.)",
        "See Chandler? I’m getting a lot of use out of them already! They’re very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants…",
        "(almost crying) They hurt so much!",
        "The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!",
        "I can’t! I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that I’d wear them all the time, I just can’t give them away!",
        "I can’t do that either! The soles’ are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.",
        "(standing up) Ahhhhhhhh!",
        "Oh nothing I’m just—just was yawning. (Mimics the groan from before and stretches.)",
        "Honey, we don’t really have to go to this thing tonight do we?",
        "I-I don’t-I don’t think that I’m gonna wear the boots tonight.",
        "Well y’know, I’m just-I’m just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!",
        "Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots don’t really go with it.",
        "Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, I’ll wear the boots. In fact, I’ll go into my room right now and y’know try the outfit on.",
        "Okay? (She starts to walk which causes her to start crying) Ooo wee! Christmas party in my boots! (Runs into the bedroom and mixes saying ‘ow’ with laughing.)",
        "Yeah! I didn’t know there would be dancing. That was a fun surprise!",
        "Oh no, we can’t walk!",
        "Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?",
        "I can’t walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!",
        "Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! They’re killing me! One toe at a time!",
        "How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?",
        "Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first. (She starts taking them off.) Ah…Ooh…Oohh…Ohh…Oh God…Ohh…Oh…Ohh…Ohhhh…",
        "(notices something in the window) Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!",
        "My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?",
        "Okay, I’m sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.",
        "Well I don’t have them either. Where are they?",
        "Okay. (She gets off him.) God well, we gotta go back and get them!",
        "Okay, I’m never gonna wear them again. I just didn’t get a chance to say goodbye.",
        "Okay. (Climbs back on his back.) All right.",
        "(to the boots) Bye boots—Wait! Half off?! (Chandler runs off.)",
        "(entering) Oh good you’re all here. Thanksgiving tomorrow, four o’clock. (To Rachel) Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from high school?",
        "He was in Ross’s class…marching band…kinda overweight? Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend.",
        "No that was Jarred! Wow! I haven’t thought about him in a long time… (Stares off into the distance lost in thought.) (Pause) Anyway, umm Will’s, Will’s here on business and he didn’t have a place to go so I invited him here.",
        "Oh, and by the way, he’s lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looks goo-ood! Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous! (Joey clears his throat.) I still love Chandler.",
        "All right okay, just so you know, I’m not gonna make a turkey this year.",
        "Well Phoebe doesn’t eat turkey…",
        "All right! Okay, it’s just Phoebe. Will’s still on a diet, Chandler doesn’t eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachel’s having her aversion to poultry.",
        "Anyway, it just doesn’t seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It’s a lot of work.",
        "All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just—there’s gonna be a ton left over.",
        "All right, you’re telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?",
        "Hey, isn’t weird to think about how next year at this time they’ll be a little baby at the table? (Chandler turns around in horror.) (Seeing him) Rachel’s! But good to know where you’re at!",
        "Hey!",
        "You too!",
        "Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but he’s really into the game so I don’t want to bother him. Could you help me fold these napkins? (Hands her a stack of them.)",
        "I’m gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.",
        "No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! We’re not at a barn dance. You’ve gotta—you wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you at Christmas time, remember?",
        "Is your team winning hon?",
        "Oh, I didn’t know you liked football.",
        "You like Green Bay?",
        "Hey!",
        "Aww thanks! God Will I’m so glad that you came! You look great! You must’ve lost like…",
        "A pie! (Will brought a pie.)",
        "You wanna meet some people? This is uh; this is my husband Chandler. Chandler, this is Will.",
        "This is Phoebe.",
        "(to Will) Wanna give me a hand?",
        "Well you look incredible too! You’re just—you’re so fit!",
        "Oh umm, I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.",
        "Good. And Rachel Green too. (Will stops suddenly.)",
        "Is there a problem?",
        "What?",
        "Hey, what are you doing? You gotta save room, you’ve got almost an entire turkey to eat.",
        "All right.",
        "Will! From high school.",
        "(to Will) Joey.",
        "Hey sweetie. Oh good. (Takes the baking dish from her.)",
        "That’s Will from high school!",
        "Okay, dinner’s ready!",
        "Oh, so who won?",
        "What?",
        "(breaking it up) Uh Rachel? Rachel, why don’t you sit here? (Next to Joey) And Will you sit way over there. (The other side of the table.)",
        "(laughs) This is Chandler’s chicken. This is the turkey. (Sets down a huge turkey.)",
        "About nineteen pounds.",
        "(To Rachel) Apparently you were umm, a little mean to him in high school.",
        "Oh Will. But you-you’ve worked so hard…",
        "Okay. (Chandler grabs the dish from Monica and hands it to Will who starts dishing out a large helping.)",
        "I swear I didn’t. (To Ross and Will) Hey! Is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?",
        "Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say.",
        "You started that?!",
        "Everyone at our school heard it!",
        "I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.",
        "Joey, you don’t have to finish that.",
        "Oh! Me too!",
        "That’s not totally true.",
        "Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs. Altman, our 50-year-old librarian.",
        "It’s true?!!",
        "Didn’t she walk with a cane?",
        "All right, listen you’re just being silly. Rachel, even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you. One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll!",
        "And Ross, if it weren’t for Rachel’s rumor I mean no one in high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!",
        "Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty.",
        "Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-you’ve been through so much since then. And right now you’ve got so much more important stuff going on in your life. Can’t you just let this go?",
        "Well Joey, we’re all…we’re all very proud of you.",
        "Yeah, you want some?",
        "Yes, hi.",
        "No leg-chewing for us sir.",
        "I can’t think of anything we’re doing. (Quietly) Why can’t I think of anything we’re doing?",
        "Okay, I’ll see you tomorrow! (Doug exits.) Just so you know, we’re not seeing him tomorrow. (Chandler wonders why.) I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?",
        "That’s because he wasn’t invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.",
        "Why did you do that?",
        "Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up you practically came on to me.",
        "Hey, I could’ve had you if I wanted you.",
        "You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?",
        "Like asking her to move in with you?",
        "Making her a mixed tape?",
        "All right. Have you said, \"I love you?\" You could say, I love you.",
        "That is a slap in the face.",
        "Hi Roger.",
        "Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think he’ll have s*x with you.",
        "From the tequila factory?",
        "Come here. I can breath through my mouth.",
        "I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?",
        "(interrupting) I love it! It’s huge!! Let’s open it! Open it!! (Monica rips open the paper.)",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom.",
        "All right. (He goes to push it and it doesn’t move.)",
        "Are you kidding?! I practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade! This is like—Oh my, this is like my second favorite game!",
        "Well I-I really don’t remember the name of it.",
        "Well, you just—you put a quarter in and y’know pull-pull some handles and win like a candy bar or something.",
        "Don’t feel bad for me! I won like every time!",
        "Okay, I’m next. (Phoebe starts another game.) Don’t! Don’t start another game! I said I’m next! Phoebe!",
        "Chandler! Phoebe’s hogging the game!",
        "You only think it’s stupid because you suck at it.",
        "No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why don’t you go home and wait for the thank you card?",
        "Okay. Phoebe that’s it. Come on, get out—out of the chair. Get out! (She goes to move Phoebe, but Phoebe goes limp and Monica can’t move her.) Oh come…Phoebe!",
        "Hey.",
        "Well it clearly wasn’t showering or shaving.",
        "Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man while I went off to work like some kind of chump?!",
        "What is the matter with your hand?",
        "Chandler, why would you do that?",
        "You think this is clever?",
        "Hey wait a minute, this one isn’t dirty.",
        "Ah, well if you don’t clear this off, you won’t be getting one of those from me. But Ben’s coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this can’t be there.",
        "Chandler! He’s seven; he’s not stupid.",
        "All right, look I’m just gonna unplug it.",
        "Honey you-you got to beat your scores!",
        "All right fine. Fine, I’ll do it. I’ve just got to get this off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.",
        "Okay, I got that. I’ll escape over there. I’ll come back over here. All right, come on Ms. Pac-Man. It’s got—Right—(She dies.) Well, you’re just a little bitch, aren’t you?",
        "They’re all Chandler.",
        "But Ben is coming over tonight and he can’t see this.",
        "Oh my God Phoebe, you’re on fire!",
        "Don’t touch her!!",
        "(airily) Hi.",
        "I just had the most amazing bath.",
        "Wait, you like them with me.",
        "Oh, baths are so relaxing!",
        "How dirty do you think I am? I’m telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.",
        "Boy, do I have a surprise for you!",
        "No, but someone’s really not going to get over that idea, are they?",
        "I drew you a bath!",
        "Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff! I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And got you this little plastic Navy ship. So it’s a boy bath!",
        "I swear, if you try it, you will love it!",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Bet I know how that discussion’s going to go.",
        "(entering) So?",
        "I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial!",
        "Hello?",
        "You know what? I-I think I’ll wait out here.",
        "Oh. (She goes into the bathroom.) What’s wrong?",
        "What?",
        "Okay, let’s talk about something else.",
        "Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking about rules and right and wrong and…",
        "You did? What was he talking about?",
        "(groans) That was a long night.",
        "Okay, he was talking about rules.",
        "Umm, and looking at people differently.",
        "What did he tell you?",
        "Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.",
        "Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!",
        "And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!",
        "Just a minute! (To Chandler) That’s Mrs. Tribbiani!",
        "Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?",
        "You just stay here! (Dumps a jar of bath salts in the bathtub)",
        "Oh, you had that?",
        "I thought I lost it. I got a new one, like, a month ago.",
        "Nothing.",
        "I mean, I-I, I really shouldn’t say. I mean, I’m really not supposed to.",
        "It’s a humdinger!",
        "Somebody likes you!",
        "No!",
        "It’s Joey!",
        "Is it something you’d be interested in?",
        "I guess that makes sense. So, you think you’re going to talk to him?",
        "Not Chandler, just Joey.",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah, I’m going to take a bath. I’m just going to get a magazine.",
        "What do you think you’re doing?",
        "I know that you’re new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum.",
        "Fine, you can have the bath, but I am taking your boat. Now you’re just a girl in a tub!",
        "She pulled it out of me! She’s like a conversational wizard! How’d it go?",
        "What?",
        "(Pause) I don’t think I’d care.",
        "Oh my God! A friend he’s looking at differently, but it’s wrong. It’s Rachel!",
        "Honey, cover it up with the boat!",
        "It sure is nice to do this together, isn’t it?",
        "I’m not touching you.",
        "It’s the salts.",
        "(To herself) Whatever keeps you off the balcony, big guy!",
        "(opens the door wearing a robe, but leaves the chain on) Hey, what’s up?",
        "Oh, okay. No problem.",
        "Okay.",
        "Here you go.",
        "Okay.",
        "What?!",
        "Phoebe! You kinda caught me at a bad time.",
        "Yes! Exactly.",
        "(laughs) No. (Closes the door as Chandler walks up.)",
        "Phoebe, I can explain!",
        "Well umm, Alexandra has been…",
        "Phoebe, don’t get upset!",
        "Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing; they don’t like us do they? (They gave them a pok-a-dotted punch bowl.)",
        "No, it doesn’t say where it came from. Where would we return it?",
        "Why don’t we just find a place for it?",
        "No! That’s where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?",
        "Oh, okay. Here, why don’t you let me do it?",
        "No reason. I-I keep private things in there.",
        "Feminine stuff.",
        "Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me you-you’ll let it go.",
        "Thank you! (He tries the door again and Monica glares at him.)",
        "Well it’s…I mean I’d just—I’d be self-conscious. You’re my friend; I’d be naked.",
        "That’s different, we were roommates! And when?!",
        "Hey, come on Phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me.",
        "Okay, if it means that much to you…",
        "Dinosaurs.",
        "Yes.",
        "Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!",
        "No. Ooohh…",
        "(in a sexy voice) Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah!",
        "Oh God Phoebe!! (Phoebe covers one ear.) Oh that’s it! That’s it! Right there! Oh! (Tries to cover the other ear.) Ooooh-oooh-ooooh… (Covers both ears and continues the massage with her elbows.)",
        "Hey.",
        "I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!",
        "So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?",
        "Okay.",
        "What?",
        "What’s going on?",
        "What? (Laughs.)",
        "What?! You’re crazy! There’s nothing sexual about the noises I make!",
        "Oh my—This is so embarrassing. Oh my God, I’m never gonna get massaged again!",
        "Really?!",
        "Are you sure?",
        "I guess.",
        "(entering) (Gasps) How did you get in there?!",
        "Oh no! You weren’t supposed to see this!",
        "No Chandler, you don’t understand! (Chandler starts singing the theme for Sanford and Son, an old TV show starring Redd Fox.) Okay! Okay! Okay! Fine! Now you know. Okay? I’m y’know…I’m sick.",
        "Really? You promise you won’t tell anyone?",
        "Well…it’s just umm…I’m afraid you might mess it up.",
        "Ohhh.",
        "Ohh. Oh! Ohh!",
        "Oh God!",
        "Oh yeah right there!",
        "Uh Phoebe?",
        "Hey.",
        "I just talked to Joey, I just—I want to see how you were.",
        "All right, I know you’re hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but don’t say that again.",
        "Honey, I don’t think that’s something we need to worry about! First of all he’s-he’s never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if he did you have no idea how she’d react.",
        "Joey…he’s not even thinking about going after Rachel!",
        "No! All he’s thinking about is how you’re taking this! I mean, listen it’s totally freaking him out. He’s talking about moving to Vermont.",
        "He says he wants to leave the country. (Pause) He thinks you hate him.",
        "Honey I can’t even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I don’t want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that you’re still his friend.",
        "All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.",
        "Hi!",
        "So, what have you guys been doing?",
        "I know! What is this, 1985?!",
        "Not really.",
        "So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?",
        "Oh my God! That’s my restaurant, I’m the chef there.",
        "No!",
        "Oh, I’d like a latte. Oh y’know what? If you’re gonna talk about me, I’m gonna go with you.",
        "(returning) Phoebe, good work.",
        "Yeah! Oh he’s great, I love him. (Walks away and Chandler glares at Phoebe.)",
        "Me too! Yeah, Chandler can’t stand it. He won’t even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.",
        "You know what I’d love to do? I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese—Not even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah. Ah, and pastries… (Breathlessly) And pate. Oh, I’m really not high, it’s just I used to be fat.",
        "I’d move in tomorrow!",
        "I’d like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn’t that be nice?",
        "Are you okay? You’ve been acting weird all afternoon.",
        "Jeez! What is with you?",
        "All right, what’s going on?",
        "Chandler, you don’t believe in soul mates?",
        "I don’t believe in soul mates either.",
        "No. I don’t think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.",
        "No, I’ve had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?",
        "I know.",
        "Joey, you have to talk to her!",
        "Hey Rachel!",
        "I don’t see him. Hey! Maybe he’s in the sugar bowl! (Opens the sugar bowl) Joey? Nope! (Closes the sugar bowl and they both laugh.)",
        "What’s up?",
        "We were playing a game.",
        "Sure.",
        "(To Joey) Okay, did you hear that?",
        "Honey, you gotta talk to her.",
        "Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean when they’re hungry.",
        "This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again? I mean I know it’s weird, it’s awkward, but you gotta at least try.",
        "Okay, I’m done. Read mine.",
        "(stunned) I-I’m the head chef. I-I can’t get promoted.",
        "You mean your pink shirt?",
        "No, I-I haven’t seen your pink shirt.",
        "Tea gives Phoebe the trots.",
        "Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?",
        "Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?",
        "Where is the James Taylor CD?",
        "Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, we’re just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases.",
        "Hmm, I don’t know. We really have to talk this through.",
        "Okay, I-I’m sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.",
        "Yeah, like I don’t know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.",
        "Good. (To Chandler) Uh honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack? Really?",
        "Uh I really don’t know what to tell you Rach, I really don’t. I mean, maybe Joey can help you out with your, with your big work problem.",
        "Yeah Joey she’s…Rachel’s got this really big work problem, and it is a head scratcher. Wow! (To Chandler) Y’know what, if we’re gonna make dinner we’re gonna have to leave. Yeah. (She and Chandler exit.)",
        "Honey, both yours.",
        "Yeah? The work problem?",
        "What?!",
        "You said your boss wants to buy your baby?!",
        "Chandler has two copies of Annie!",
        "That’s not your regular dry cleaners.",
        "What?!",
        "Don’t worry Phoebe, you’re gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.",
        "Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like Disneyland for me. I’m-I’m gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts. (She points to and walks over to the electric clothes rack they have.)",
        "(to the clerk) Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?",
        "(entering with something behind her back) Phoebe, c’mere. I want to show you something in the bathroom.",
        "Nothing. Just something I want to get Phoebe’s opinion on for Valentine’s Day.",
        "Not really.",
        "All right, big brother. (holds up two erm…revealing articles of clothing) Which of these do you think would make your little sister look hotter, so your best friend would want to do her?",
        "(from her bedroom) Okay! I’ll be right out. I’m slipping into something a little less comfortable, and a little more slutty.",
        "(entering from her bedroom) So what do you think? (referring to her outfit)",
        "(to herself) I’ve still got it!",
        "What is it?",
        "Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebe’s. Why were you even watching it?",
        "Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you p0rn for Valentine’s Day… (pulls a video out of a basket) you were right! Apparently, it’s about a young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having s*x with a lot of guys! Yeah, it got four starts! (looks closer) Oh, wait a minute. Those aren’t stars. Anyway, you want to take a look?",
        "Honey, what’s going on?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Chandler, we can’t let this tape wreck Valentine’s Day!",
        "Child-birth, it’s a natural thing! It’s beautiful.",
        "Oh! Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!",
        "Don’t touch me!",
        "How long has it been this time?",
        "That’s better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it…except all I did was think about it.",
        "Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why don’t we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh, thank God!",
        "Come in!",
        "Oh, my God.",
        "Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It’s here.",
        "No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!",
        "She’s right…of course not. Honey, get the tape.",
        "It’s…still beautiful.",
        "I know! I know, I’m so sorry for you!",
        "Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!",
        "Oh…Rach!",
        "Yeah.",
        "(To Ross) Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom and dad this year?",
        "Yeah, I’d really like to.",
        "Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and it’s always really moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year I’m going to make them cry.",
        "No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, \"God, your brother.\" Know what they’ll say this year? \"God, you\"",
        "Really you can do that?",
        "Oh I’m working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it. Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out. (Hands him a picture.)",
        "It’s a dead dog. That’s Chi-Chi; she died when I was in high school.",
        "The good stuff, huh?",
        "You got a present for my parents. That’s so sweet.",
        "What?!",
        "That’s my old dog. He passed away years ago.",
        "It’s out on the island. It’s in Massapequa.",
        "Okay, I got my note cards. (To Chandler) Do you got the presents?",
        "And I’ve got the car keys.",
        "Yeah.",
        "He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle.",
        "It’s just that, it’s so much.",
        "I feel terrible.",
        "Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit ‘em. I can’t wait. They’re going to be crying so hard. They’re going to be fighting for breath.",
        "Okay it’s time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year I’m going to do it.",
        "No, no it’s going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I got married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I probably don’t say it enough, but I love you. (Pretends to cry hoping her parents will join her.) When I look around this room, I’m-I’m saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here, but she can’t because she’s dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how cute she is. (Holds up the picture and pretends to cry again). Was. (To an old man by the stage.) Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember she’s dead. Okay, her and Nana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her children in Terms of Endearment? (Chandler covers his ears) Didn’t see that? No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching 60 Minutes these orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love. (Waits for people to cry, but doesn’t get any tears.) You people are made of stone! Here’s to mom and dad! Whatever!",
        "Okay that’s it. I give up. At mom and dad’s 40th anniversary, you’re the one giving the speech.",
        "Oh, come on.",
        "(starts to cry) Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?",
        "Hey!",
        "How cool is this?! We know three down! I’m touching three down! (She has her hand on his shoulder.)",
        "Three down knows I’m married, what’s three down doin’?",
        "(To Chandler) You think we’re being obvious?",
        "Joey! You’re doing great!",
        "Bye. (They resume their previous positions.)",
        "You can’t say that!! You-you don’t know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn’t...bend that way. So... (Looks at Joey.)",
        "You slept with her didn’t you?",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "(seeing the stack of newspapers) Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers! It must be a good review! Is it great?!",
        "(reading) Oh dear God!",
        "What about the rest of Manhattan?!",
        "Oh my God, this is horrible!",
        "I’m so humiliated!",
        "You don’t think that umm, (reading) \"The chef’s Mahi Mahi was awful awful,\" is bad press?",
        "Is he right? Am I really—Am I awful?",
        "We said at the movies, but…",
        "Joey! (He returns) Now that you’re here…",
        "Hey Joey, come taste this.",
        "Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well… (Feeds him a spoonful of what she’s cooking.) I’m getting my revenge!",
        "No. He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bollet base again. Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow! \"Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica.\"",
        "Hi! Umm, I’m Monica Geller, I’m the chef at Alessandro’s.",
        "I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my boule base another chance.",
        "Spoon? (Hands him one and he tastes it.) So, what do you think?",
        "I can.",
        "Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bournese has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly teradyne.",
        "Monica.",
        "Okay. (Does so.)",
        "Oh no! I don’t know anything about cooking. I had to ask someone what it’s called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.",
        "I-I-I’m sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn’t hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?",
        "That’s right.",
        "Y’know, you called me that before so I-I took the liberty of fashioning a star out of aluminum foil. Now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give me the star. (Hands it to her.)",
        "Wow! A star! (The class glares at her.) I know you all hate me and-and I’m sorry, but I don’t care.",
        "Joey! I’m so proud of you!",
        "Excuse me? He doesn’t even know what he’s doing!",
        "I do! I’m a professional chef! (The class gasps.) Oh relax! It’s not a courtroom drama!",
        "I’m-I’m sorry, it’s just that umm… Well I-I cook at this restaurant, Alessandro’s, and umm I just got a really bad review…",
        "You do?",
        "Oh, I’m totally crazy, but you-you like the food?",
        "Okay then, I don’t stink. I’m a good chef. Okay. (Starts to leave.)",
        "Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?",
        "Okay.",
        "Hey!",
        "Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.",
        "Oh my God, your mother!",
        "Well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was.",
        "Well it wasn’t my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!",
        "(interrupting her) Oh give it a rest!",
        "Okay, y’know what? Don’t worry, okay? We’ll take care of it. We’ll call her. Just go home and get ready.",
        "Go! I have it in my book. Go! (Rachel leaves and Monica calls Mrs. Green.) (To Phoebe) Wait a minute! If you’re in charge of the invitations why am I the one who has to call her—Hello Mrs. Green! Hi, it’s Monica Geller.",
        "(on phone) Hi, umm I know this is last minute, but we’ve decided to throw an impromptu baby shower for Rachel today.",
        "Yeah, I’m sorry. I’m-I’m so sorry.",
        "(To Phoebe) Oh my God, my ass is sweating! (on phone) Please! Please! Can you come? It’s today at four.",
        "Thank you. (Hangs up.)",
        "Son of a bitch! (Calls Mrs. Green again.)",
        "You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!",
        "Hi!",
        "Yes, thank you so much. And again, we’re so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.",
        "She’s still mad.",
        "Phoebe, Sandra’s mad at you too. It-it doesn’t bother you?",
        "Okay. I can do that. (Pause) I gotta go powder my ass.",
        "What?",
        "I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.",
        "That’s right. That is right, you go over there and tell her you don’t want her to live with you. Do not take no for an answer!",
        "(To Phoebe) This is great! Now she’s gonna be mad at Rachel! Y’know what? And I’m just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had.",
        "Yes! Yes! And I think that the first gift that Rachel opens should be from the grandmother of the baby, because you’re the most important person in this room. And in the world!",
        "Rachel, listen to your mother. She is very smart.",
        "It is going to be okay! (Mrs. Green glances over her shoulder and glares at Monica while she heads for the bathroom.) It was worth a shot.",
        "It’s frightening.",
        "(laughs) You’re still so funny. You’re so funny. (To Phoebe) What do I do?",
        "Y’know what? You’re-you’re right.",
        "Really?",
        "Okay! I will! Mrs. Green? Mrs. Green! (She ignores Monica and Monica follows her out into the hall with Phoebe in tow.) It is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host! Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it! Now what I did to you, it wasn’t on purpose! But what you’re during to me now is just plain spiteful!",
        "That’s right! Maybe it’s time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady…old lady…lady!",
        "So whenever you’re ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you. Good day! (Monica and Phoebe reenter the apartment and Monica closes the door on a stunned Mrs. Green.) I can’t feel my legs!",
        "Yeah? I’m proud of me too.",
        "Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?",
        "Okay. (When Phoebe turns around Monica runs out into the hall after Mrs. Green.) Mrs. Green! Okay I’m really sorry!! I’m apologizing for the—(She trips and falls down the stairs.) (Pause) Okay, I bit my tongue, but I’m still really sorry!",
        "Are we gonna take a limo?",
        "Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!",
        "What are you doing here so early?",
        "Well, well Ross didn’t care enough to be here, so I think he’s out. You snooze you lose.",
        "Well then somebody’s snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut down to here. (Points to her stomach just above her belly button.)",
        "Star in a movie.",
        "Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you’re gonna take him? Joey, I don’t think you’re comprehending just how slutty this dress is!",
        "She’s over a week late! She gotta have it today, right?",
        "Hmm, care to make it interesting? I’ll bet you that she’ll have it by this time tomorrow.",
        "Okay, how much?",
        "How about fifty bucks?",
        "Damnit! Damnit!! Here’s your fifty bucks! (Pays Phoebe.)",
        "Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!",
        "Okay.",
        "She’s in the bathroom.",
        "I’m actually with her on this one.",
        "Hey!",
        "What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?",
        "Well what is it? What is it? If it’s gonna help bring the baby here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.",
        "Do it!",
        "I’m just saying it’s been a really long time for you. I mean, women have needs. Do it, get yours!",
        "All right, let’s be practical, if Ross isn’t willing to do it, he’s not the only guy in the world you can have s*x with. You can borrow Chandler—Chandler is good!",
        "Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.",
        "Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you’re gonna have the baby and I don’t want to lose again!",
        "Wait a minute! Now I’m betting against all three of you?",
        "Oh, okay!",
        "Two hundred.",
        "That’s it. I’m done. I don’t care when the baby comes, no more betting.",
        "Hello? (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up.) I guess we can bet one more time.",
        "How did you know that?! (Runs to yell at Joey’s apartment.) Joey! Chandler!! It’s time!",
        "You know everything!! Oh wait, double or nothing. I bet you the baby is over seven pounds. (Phoebe isn’t interested.) I bet you it has hair. (She’s still not interested.) I bet you it’s a girl.",
        "(following her) I’ll give you really good odds.",
        "(entering with everyone else including Mr. Geller) Hi! Hey look who’s here!",
        "Oh, Aunt Liddy’s coming? That means we get five dollars each!",
        "About what?",
        "Isn’t she beautiful?",
        "I want a baby.",
        "Come on! Come on, if we have s*x again it’ll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet’s still available?",
        "Deal!",
        "Oh, I still can’t believe my dad saw us having s*x! He didn’t make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!",
        "Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?",
        "It wasn’t fun?!",
        "The truth is, Dad, we’re-we’re trying.",
        "Yeah, we’re trying to get pregnant.",
        "Well, that’s okay dad, we-we can wait until later.",
        "Daddy?!",
        "Daddy! I don’t think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had s*x.",
        "I don’t feel good right now.",
        "Hey.",
        "Well, now’s a good time. I’m on my way to have my ears cut off.",
        "What?",
        "Is he crazy?! You just had Ross’s baby!",
        "What?! Are you crazy? You just had Ross’s baby! It’s-it’s so inappropriate. No, it’s worse than that. It’s wrong. It’s… It is bigger than mine! (Rachel’s engagement ring.)",
        "You can’t marry him!",
        "Well do you love him?",
        "Sure?",
        "Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?",
        "(walking by with Chandler.) Hey dad!",
        "How are you doing?",
        "We took a cab. Did you guys walk?",
        "Hey, you wanna see something?",
        "Umm, this is going to be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler. Honey?",
        "Listen uh, I-I’ve been doing some thinking, and I don’t know whether it’s because we’re here or Rachel’s giving birth but umm, I think we should try to have a baby.",
        "(freaking out) What-what-what’s that now?!",
        "What?! Are you kidding me?! You-you-you think we’re ready to have a baby now?!",
        "Yeah but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird like mine is now!",
        "Okay, just back off mister! Whoa. (Pause) ‘Cause I am ready to have a baby. I just want Joey to be the father.",
        "That’s it! Right there! Is all I wanted!",
        "Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it!",
        "What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?",
        "What?",
        "We are pretty good.",
        "Well maybe I’m ready now. I mean, it’s a little scary, but maybe it’s right.",
        "What?!!",
        "So we’re gonna try? I mean, are we trying?",
        "Okay, hold on a sec.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, we could start trying. Now.",
        "No, not here. Maybe here.",
        "And it’s so clean!!",
        "I think we found a place.",
        "Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?",
        "Okay! Okay! Make me sterile, but okay.",
        "Okay. Let’s hurry—Oh wait! Do we have a condom? (He looks at her.) Oh right! (Laughs and they resume making out when a nurse catches them in the act.)",
        "We could, or we can have s*x in it.",
        "(lying down on the bed) Okay mister! Fertilize me!",
        "Does that sound like Janice?",
        "Hey!",
        "I can’t believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?",
        "Oh my God! She’s amazing. Oh, oh I’m so glad you guys got drunk and had s*x!",
        "What’s the matter?",
        "It’s okay honey, you’ll find a name.",
        "Yeah, I’ve had them picked out since I was fourteen.",
        "Umm, okay. If it’s a boy it’s Daniel.",
        "I don’t want to say.",
        "Okay. It’s Emma.",
        "Take it.",
        "It’s clearly an Emma.",
        "Yeah, but I love you more. Besides y’know, nothing goes with Bing. So I’m screwed. I mean… (Rachel hands Emma to Monica.) Oh, hi Emma. Yeah, that’s you. You’re our little Em. Oh what’s that honey? What? Oh, you want a little cousin? (To Chandler) You want a cousin right now?!",
        "I know. Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever? We may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.",
        "Ok, I don’t wanna be negative so I’ll say that most of the signs you bought are good.",
        "(looking at Chandler sleeping with a balloon in his mouth) So sexy. (Waking him up.) Honey.",
        "Honey why don’t you go lie down.",
        "Phoebe did the signs!",
        "Phoebe! But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket.",
        "Wow, he’s really not letting this go, is he?",
        "Breaks your heart doesn’t it",
        "Alright here’s something, it says to try holding the baby close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.",
        "It worked!",
        "Umm, she Rach, not it, she.",
        "Oh my god, I am losing my mind.",
        "Try feeding her again.",
        "I know, that’s why I said again!",

        "What’s going on?",
        "Excuse me?",
        "(stands up angry) Tulsa, Oklahoma!",
        "Chandler, I don’t even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!",
        "Are you trying to tell me that we’re moving to Oklahoma, or that you’re gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?",
        "Thank you.",
        "Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.",
        "About a week and a half.",
        "Rach, try holding her a different way.",
        "You’re just new at this, it’ll get better, think about your first day at work. I mean, that couldn’t have been easy but you figured that out.",
        "Okay I’ll take her, here. (Takes Emma)",

        "Is this not the good part? Do you want me to fast forward to something a little toothier.",
        "Oh well this is the only one they had at our video store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. Or does it always have to be sharks?",

My company has asked me to head up our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated.\nRoss: Oh my God!\nPhoebe: What?!\nRachel: What?!\nRoss: Monday?!\nJoey: How long do you have to go for?\nChandler: They said it could be up to a year.\nJoey: A year?!\nRachel: (To Monica) Do you have to go?\nMonica: I kind of have to don't I? Because of this stupid thing (Points to her wedding ring.)\nChandler: There is nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh?\nJoey: Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot, but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week.\nChandler: I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it.\nJoey: We were gonna go see the Jets!\nRoss: You can't go, I mean you're the glue that holds this group together!\nChandler: Really?\nRoss: Not you.\nJoey: I can't believe you guys are moving.\nPhoebe: I call their apartment!!!\nEveryone: No!!! Ah!! Ahh!!!",
        "(Enters) Hey!\nMonica: Hey!\nChandler: I've got good news!\nMonica: You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?\nChandler: Okay, I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa. You can stay here and keep your job.\nMonica: It's great! How?\nChandler. Well my boss and I worked out a deal where I only have to be in Tulsa four days a week, so the other three I can be here with you.\nMonica: So you're gonna be gone four days a week? (Thinks about it.) No.\nChandler: I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?\nMonica: No. I can't be away from you for that long.\nChandler: Really?\nMonica: Yeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year.\nChandler: That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.\nMonica: Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you.\nChandler: Hey, you said that without gagging!\nMonica: I know! (They high-five.)",
        "It's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their pen1s against your knee?\nMonica: Excuse me?\nChandler: I know what she's talking about.\nRachel: We've got to find a new pediatrician. Ross was getting sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it.\nMonica: Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?\nRachel: Ross said he died.\nMonica: He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.\nRachel: Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.\nMonica: Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist.\nChandler: He saw a therapist?\nMonica: Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just really freaked him out.\nRachel: Why? What was it?\nMonica: That I was going to eat him.",

Chandler is in the kitchen with his laptop)\nHey!\nChandler: Hey!\nMonica: What are you doing?\nChandler: Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.\nMonica: That's so sweet. Find anything?\nChandler: Slim Pickings.\nMonica: Nothing, huh?\nChandler: No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite.\nMonica: 'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.\nChandler: 'So Cheesy' also has an opening.\nMonica: Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy, who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.\nChandler: Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.\nMonica: (On phone) Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo (sp?) is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo (sp?) 'I'll take it!'",
        "Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do.\nMonica: You're right. (Pause) Maybe I shouldn't go.\nChandler: What?\nMonica: So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javo (sp?). It's just a little outside of Tulsa.\nChandler: How far outside?\nMonica: Manhattan.\nChandler: And you're thinking of taking it? (Pause) So before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now it's old job, (Raises his hand) me, (Raises his hand) new job.\nMonica: I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.\nChandler: What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?\nMonica: Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.\nChandler: I think you should take the job.\nMonica: Really?\nChandler: Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.\nMonica: That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!\n(Ross and Rachel enter with Emma.)\nRoss: Hey!\nMonica: How was the pediatrician?\nRachel: Oh, I really liked him. (Looks at Ross) Yeah, it was really, really, really good.\nRoss: You promised you wouldn't say anything.\nRachel: I know. (Pause) Ross still sees his pediatrician!!! (To Ross) I don't care!\nMonica: Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?\nRoss: He's a brilliant diagnostician!\nChandler: Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?\nRachel: Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.\nRoss: Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'\nChandler: Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?\nRoss: Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!\nChandler: That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!\nRoss: It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!",
        "(Enters) Oh good, you haven't left yet.\nMonica: Where have you been?\nRoss: I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office. There was some guy that freaked everybody out.\nChandler: Well, you got here just in time. I really have to go buddy. (They hug)\nRoss: Oh man.\nMonica: Promise to call me when you land.\nChandler: Of course I will call you. I love you.\nMonica: I love you too. (They kiss)\nRachel: Okay, wow, wow, wow.

Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.\nChandler: Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?\nJoey: Dude, you see right thru me!!

        "How can you smoke in this day of age? Do you not seen that ad with a little kid walks to grandpa, it's chilling.",
        "So what? Don't you have any will power?",
        "You said that was sexy!",
        "That's right, because I forbid you to smoke again.",
        "Mhmm.",
        "Don't joke (?) with me, okay? I'm very, very upset right now.",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, I'll tell you what we're gonna do: We are already late for Phoebe's birthday dinner, so you point out put out that cigarette, we're gonna put this fight on hold and go have s*x.",
        "s*x! This is the last day I'm ovulating, and when we don't do it now, we'll have to wait till next month. (walks towards bedroom)",
        "Oh yeah!",
        "Huh, and no cuddling.",
        "Oh good, I hate it when you do that",
        "Spend more time with the tie. That'll make a baby.",
        "Oh sure, now you're Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to have s*x right after my uncle's funeral",
        "No, you're right. Mnya, we shouldn't do it like this. Huch. For what it's worth, I'm, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come down on you so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world.",
        "Yah.",
        "D'you want to?",
        "'kay.",
        "You know what? Let's not talk.",
        "Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.",
        "Oh, blablablabaybaybay.",
        "I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said you wouldn't have s*x with me while we're fighting.",
        "That's right, I got mine.",
        "(entering with husband) Happy birthday!",
        "Well, we had a little fight.",
        "You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy. (being sat down) Ooh, uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isn't it? How d'you get a bigger table? You-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shut up Monica. Whoo, I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck.",
        "Why would you do that?",
        "Mom's here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me she was out of town.",
        "Uch, you see, I'm ovulating.",
        "Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just can't get enough.",
        "Bye.",
        "So, I'm, I'm probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it another try?",
        "We don't have much time. Once the egg decended the oviduct ...",
        "What do you do with your money now?",
        "Joe... Emus are birds. You raise them for meat.",
        "Joey, I think you should consider something a little less risky. I\nmean, I think in this market, real estate is your best investment.The Fed.\njust lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally\ndeductible. (looks at Chandler) That's right, I know some stuff!",
        "(very excited) Oh, and you know who's selling a great apartment?\nRichard!",
        "My dad told me. They play golf together.",
        "Hey!",
        "Wow, the boyfriend's parents! That's a big step.",
        "They just gonna love you, just be yourself.",
        "Oh God, neither!",
        "I'm sorry honey, but we're gonna take you shopping. It's gonna be\nfine.",
        "You went out with Wallis Pincer?",
        "I knew you didn't get a 1400!",
        "(Monica looks at Rachel in disbelief) She said WHAT?",
        "What are you guys doing? (Monica hears the moaning coming from the\nTV and looks at it) Oh my God, is that Richard? (It only takes a split\nsecond for Joey to realise, he pulls Monica down by her jacket, and she\nfalls, face down next to Chandler. Chandler gets up a bit, and Joey quickly\ncovers Chandler's eyes with his hand.)",
        "So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?",
        "That tape was never meant to be seen by... (pauses) Joey I would\nfeel more comfortable if I was having this conversation in private.",
        "Why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you\nwatch it?",
        "Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?",
        "Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that is? You\nshouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him.",
        "Chandler, this is not our problem. We've got each other. That's all\nthat matters.",
        "Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life! (she\nturns on the video again)",
        "THAT'S NOT ME!",
        "That b*st*rd taped over me! (Chandler's expression changes)",
        "I-It's just so insulting! Big spring for a new blank tape, Doctor!",
        "(in her apartment, screaming) I LOVE MY NEW JOB!",
        "YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro's.",
        "Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean.",
        "Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy, Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt, the funniest guy I have ever met. (Chandler, who was almost asleep again, sits up straight in bed in an instant and can't believe what he just heard.)",
        "Maybe he didn't give you a chance.",
        "Oh, well... That had been your window.",
        "Really? The scientist guy?",
        "Continue...",
        "Phoebe!",
        "Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?",
        "What are you gonna do?",
        "You have to tell David!",
        "Heeeeeey!",
        "(Doesn't believe what she's hearing) Was your cabin pressurised?",
        "No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?",
        "Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken. (Phoebe bursts out in a laugh)",
        "Hi! There you are.",
        "Yeah! I think that's great!",
        "Oh... How are they?",
        "Yes... What is the end of that sentence?",
        "Yeah, so?",
        "Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...",
        "I can't believe he's that upset about this...",
        "Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!",
        "Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it! (Monica wipes away tears)",
        "Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy! (Chandler turns to Joey)",
        "Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey.",
        "Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks...",
        "Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...? (he laughs) That slayed me.",
        "Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore.",
        "Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you.",
        "Naaaa... He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing so hard, I swear... a little pee came out.",
        "Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?",
        "No, I think we should save our china for something really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.",
        "What if something gets broken, they're so expensive.",
        "Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen comes over..",
        "<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.",
        "Careful. <hands Chandler a china plate> Careful. CAREFUL!",
        "I know, after you left the store, I chose different ones.",
        "well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.",
        "Hi.",
        "yeah oh my god, I'm so moved.",
        "Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.",
        "Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved. <pinches Ross' arm>",
        "No, honey, its. thats a special plate.  See its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.",
        "That was me.",
        "Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.",
        "Thats not how you see me, is it?",
        "Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.",
        "Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about. I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of Merlot and a five year old condom.",
        "No you learn these things. You grow into it.",
        "I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts.",
        "Can you hear me say \"You're grounded\"?",
        "How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture.",
        "Oh wait.. What are you doing?",
        "Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.",
        "Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!",
        "uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a plate. Its not like somebody died.",
        "I don't care. <pauses and realizes...> Oh my god. I've lost the will to scold.",
        "Like only if the queen comes?",
        "Bye plates!",
        "What? Something happened with the plates?",
        "Hello?",
        "Really? But tomorrow night’s the only one I get off from the restaurant. If you go to the game then we won’t have another night together for a week.",
        "Look. I don’t want to be one of those wives that says “You can’t go to the game”, “you have to spend time with me”, so, if you just realize it on your own?",
        "[On phone] Tell him you haven’t seen your wife in a long time. [In apartment] Tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult. Tell him that…what little time that we have is precious.",
        "Hi! [Surprised]",
        "Welcome home.",
        "What do you think?",
        "Just a second.",
        "Why not?",
        "So you lied to him?",
        "Hi!",
        "[Nervous giggle] Because I, erm, well, Chandler’s gonna be home in a couple of days, so I thought that I would just, er, practice the art of seduction.",
        "I was just doing Chandler’s side of the conversation, y’know like “Hi”, “How do I look” [In Chandler’s voice] “Really sexy”, “Could I be any more turned on?”",
        "Because, one of them is for you! [Monica goes to get a glass. Chandler looks at Joey through the peep-hole and Chandler ducks. Monica comes back to the door with the two glasses of red wine. Gives one to Joey. ‘Clinks’ the glasses together] Okay, bye, bye!",
        "You might wanna keep practising.",
        "What?",
        "Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you are not in Tulsa.",
        "I don’t want him to think that I'm having an affair.",
        "Yes. Because all good plans start with “I’ll just go down the fire escape…”",
        "Aren’t you afraid that Joey’s going to figure all this out? [Silence] I heard it!",
        "Scary pigeon’s back?",
        "Huh, Chandler – you’re home!",
        "What are you saying?",
        "There's no man in here! How dare you accuse me of that? [Slaps Chandler]",
        "I arranged some pillows on the bed to make it look like a guy!",
        "I think that's you.",
        "I can’t believe you thought I was cheating. You owe me an apology.",
        "It’s an honest mistake. It can happen to anybody. Alright, see ya.",
        "Joey?",
        "I don’t know what to say. We shouldn’t have lied to you.",
        "You can go.",
        "You should go to the game. It’s okay, I want you to.",
        "Yeah, it’ll be fine. Y’know, maybe I’ll stay and practice the art of seduction.",
        "That’s gonna be so hot!",
        "I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas.",
        "It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!",
        "It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week,\nbut for Christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do,\nI understand.",
        "(shocked) You're not gonna be here new year's eve??",
        "No!",
        "Come on Ben.",
        "Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa,\nthe Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's\na sentence I'd never thought I'd say.",
        "(to Chandler) Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?\n(She has a really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling\nChandler's beard.)",
        "Yeah, is that okay?",
        "No.",
        "Hi Honey! We're all here; we just want to wish you a merry\nChristmas.",
        "So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?",
        "Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.",
        "Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about new year's eve.\nWhere is everybody else?",
        "Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?",
        "What does she do there?",
        "She did WHAT?",
        "*What*??",
        "Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest\ngirl in Oklahoma get back to work.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay!",
        "Merry Christmas.",
        "Really?",
        "Well, not anymore.",
        "I know, I just thought it would be fun.",
        "Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that\nyou should feel guilty about taking advantage.",
        "Okay!",
        "(breaking the kiss) Y'know what's weird?",
        "This doesn't feel weird!",
        "You're a really good kisser.",
        "Hm-hmm!",
        "Wow! You are really fast!",
        "We're gonna see each other naked.",
        "Do you wanna do it at the same time?",
        "One!",
        "Two!",
        "Eh, we weren't that close anyway!",
        "Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not\njust goof around with him.",
        "I think you're better than you think you are.",
        "(interrupting) Know when to stop.",
        "Yeah. (They kiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts\nto dance. Without turning around:) Don't do the dance.",
        "I can't get married until I get something old, something new,\nsomething borrowed, and something blue.",
        "You're so efficient. I love you!",
        "No-no-no, wait! We need something old!",
        "That'll work!",
        "Okay, now we just need something borrowed!",
        "That's stealing!",
        "Ohh. (Rubs her fake stomach.)",
        "Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask\nyou to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you\nwork, you work really hard for that.",
        "Eh, you work for that.",
        "You do?!",
        "Oh, you're so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what\nabout our, what about the future and stuff?",
        "You thought about that?",
        "How many kids were we gonna have?",
        "What else did you think about?",
        "(laughs) Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.",
        "No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.",
        "Uh-hmm.",
        "I love you. (They kiss.)",
        "\"Wendy\" is a fat girl name.",
        "Okay, fine. Let's talk about snow. -- Do you think it's snowing\nin Tulsa, where my husband is having s*x on a copying machine?",
        "What are you doing here?",
        "But I thought if you left, you get fired.",
        "What?",
        "Oh my god!",
        "No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it's great!",
        "Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer... (he looks\ndown on himself, checking, then nods satisfied and marks the\noffer with a pen) (to Monica:) Hey, d'you know what I just\nrealized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of\nthe household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!",
        "You are! (she picks up a bill from the table, handing it to\nChandler) Hey, here's twenty bucks. -- Why don't you go buy\nyourself something pretty while I'm at work tomorrow?",
        "Good morning, Tiger! I'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. You're gonna get me good and pregnant.",
        "Well, I just lost my erection.",
        "You're supposed to find your passion in life. You can be whatever you wanna be now. It's exciting.",
        "Hey, wait a second. I can help you with this. You just need to be organized. We can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. There\ncould be folders and files!",
        "I know!!! My erection is back!",
        "(Flipping through bunch of folders as Chandler enters from bathroom) Okay, I have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key\npassages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision.",
        "Okay. Let us start with the A's. Advertising.",
        "Don't you want to look through the rest?",
        "You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder!",
        "I got one. \"Socks. Because your family's feet deserve the best.\"",
        "I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone.",
        "\"Marriage. It's not for everybody.\"",
        "(Enters) Okay, it's baby time. Pants off Bing. (Sees Ross) Didn't see you there Geller.",
        "We're gonna have s*x.",
        "Let me put it this way. We're having s*x whether you're here or not.",
        "(Enters from the bedroom) Hi, good morning lover. I gotta say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees.",
        "(To Ross) Sorry. (To Chandler) But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.",
        "What are you talking about?",
        "What!? You faked it?",
        "You faked it? You couldn't have faked it!",
        "Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?",
        "Like a month?",
        "Really, you want to wait a year?",
        "I really wanna have a baby.\nChandler: Yeah, me too. Look, I'll just get my old job back.",
        "No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.",
        "It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really\nbusy. There's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons.",
        "It's gonna be really scary. I mean, god. When we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I\nwon't have time to clean it. What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? Messes up all the ribbons?! What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff\ntakes up all the space!? Where will all the ribbons go!?!",
        "Yes, please!",
        "I wish I could say the same. I'm a little shook up!",
        "Would you stop staring at her?",
        "What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.",
        "Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl for once.",
        "They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.",
        "(to Chandler) Take me home! (they quickly leave)",
        "Hey Rach!",
        "Ready for your birthday lunch?",
        "Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?",
        "You were just being so nice to him!",
        "Right there! That was so fake!",
        "Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time.",
        "Does he?",
        "Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?",
        "Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me! (put her glass down)",
        "Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!",
        "So this is what a stroke feels like.",
        "Hey!",
        "No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?",
        "Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from your office didn't show up (Gavin shows up at the balcony windows).",
        "Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover.",
        "(from inside) Again, you're welcome.",
        "Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby! (screams from another room)",
        "No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,",
        "Only if I don't have to get up and sing.",
        "It's just, I'm not good at singing.",
        "No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!",
        "So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass judgments on others?",
        "I'm there!",
        "You kissed him?",
        "Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?",
        "Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?",
        "I thought you hated him?",
        "So are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?",
        "Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, and you definitely should talk to Ross",
        "No I told you I can't.",
        "What have you heard me sing?",
        "What?",
        "Yeah I do rock that one.",
        "Just a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I would sing...",
        "\"Delta Dawn\"",
        "Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.",
        "Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing \"Delta Dawn\"",
        "\"To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?\"",
        "\"Take me to the mansion in the sky-y\". I am sorry, the song is over. Did you see me out there?",
        "I can’t believe I did this. I can’t believe I'm singing for the people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear that",
        "Good? Didn’t you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for making me do this. That’s is the best gift ever.",
        "Ok, for my next song I think I’ll sing something a little more upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the Pointer",
        "Honey, you’re just in time, I’m about to sing another song!",
        "And they love me!",
        "All right, watch!",
        "\"Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. Give in this",
        "Oh, who cares, they still love me! \"I am so excited...\"",
        "Hey!",
        "Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?",
        "Oh my god.",
        "Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are...",
        "You want a job? Turn off \"Oprah,\" and send out a resume!",
        "Oh, it's perfect.",
        "Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.",
        "Yeah.",
        "No, it's not.",
        "Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.",
        "Okay.",
        "Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.",
        "Chandler!",
        "We're okay. I'm still ovulating.",
        "So, let's do this.",
        "Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.",
        "Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.",
        "Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?",
        "Canoodling?",
        "I don't know. I mean, I guess having s*x in front of a baby isn't so...",
        "I guess you're right.",
        "But what kind of a sick b*st*rd wants to do it in front of a deer?",
        "She's asleep. Chandler?",
        "What are you doing?",
        "She's asleep.",
        "Yes, but we have to be fast.",
        "Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.",
        "Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.",
        "Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?",
        "Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma. You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.",
        "Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another, we're giving a baby back to Rachel.",
        "Hey, did you stop by here?",
        "Oh my god, then...",
        "Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!",
        "Oh, we were playing \"peek-a-boo.\" She just – she loves it when I'm dramatic.",
        "No, we weren't!",
        "No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!",
        "Unless what?",
        "(shocked) Really? (She looks around, suddenly embarrassed) Let's get past the moment.",
        "(hugging Chandler) Oh, honey, that's incredible!",
        "Ross, you did not come up with \"got milk?\"",
        "Hey!",
        "He just left.",
        "What is she talking about?",
        "Is it a good play?",
        "(sighs) He was so good in that movie of MacBeth. ",
        "No, but… I saw the previews. They played it right before Jackass.",
        "Hey! Maybe the monkey will be at the audition!",
        "Hey, how did the audition go? ",
        "What happened?",
        "So far so good! (Joey nods)",
        "(standing up, walking towards him) What's wrong?",
        "So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience.",
        "What are they? (They sit down again)",
        "Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.",
        "Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers? ",
        "You okay?!",
        "(bewildered) How do you know a mugger?",
        "(shocked) Seriously?",
        "(disapproving) Phoebe, that is awful!",
        "You're mother killed herself!",
        "Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross.",
        "Well, Ross was mugged as a kid.",
        "(coughing) Wonderwoman!",
        "Oh yeah! What was his superpower again?",
        "That's it. ",
        "What?",
        "Yeah?",
        "So?",
        "\"Geology rocks!\" ",
        "Oh my god!",
        "Hey!",
        "What are you doing?",
        "No, that seems about right.",
        "Wow, that's a big cable bill! Huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering p0rn… on a Saturday afternoon?! (shocked) I was in the house! ",
        "… that she was the huge guy that mugged you? Yah. ",
        "… everybody we know? Yeah.",
        "Hey!",
        "So, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?",
        "Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month!",
        "Oh, honey!I can't. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!",
        "Yeah, I'm sorry. I really am.",
        "Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant!",
        "Why don't you take Ross?",
        "No, not if their room has two beds!",
        "Thank you!",
        "Thank you!(she looks at the 3rd customer waiting for a compliment) You haven't said anything...",
        "Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism.",
        "What musician?",
        "What are you doing here!",
        "Great!",
        "Listen Phoebe...",
        "You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but...",
        "This is kind of a classy place.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.",
        "Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?",
        "What do you think brought than on?",
        "A love scene? With who?",
        "Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! (pause) Oh right, real life more important.",
        "I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.",
        "Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.",
        "It was hard!",
        "Hi.",
        "Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.",
        "Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.",
        "I didn't say your songs were not good enough.",
        "Tiny portions?",
        "Phoebe, it's not about quantity.",
        "Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.",
        "Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.",
        "You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.",
        "Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.",
        "Ok, you have to stop playing now.",
        "Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!",
        "(to the restuarant customers) Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. (pauses as if waiting for something).. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? (a few people raise their hands)",
        "Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? (a few raise their hands again).",
        "Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? (a few raise their hands)",
        "Excuse us! (then to Phoebe) Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? (raises her hand)",
        "I'm sorry...",
        "ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?",
        "(without looking up from what she's doing) Besides tampons and salt? (Then looks) Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you. (Opens the box) That's weird...it's empty!",
        "I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money?",
        "I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in.",
        "Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold.",
        "Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.",
        "Why not?",
        "Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.",
        "Hey Joey!",
        "Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you, will never get back to Chandler.",
        "(Looks exasperated) Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.",
        "But Chandler lent you money!",
        "Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.",
        "Two thousand dollars?",
        "Yeah...",
        "Hey!",
        "Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?",
        "You're a pig. And you can't do this.",
        "Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal your makeup. Unless they're playing \"This is what my sister would look like\" (Looks at Chandler)",
        "Is that a bit you guys do?",
        "We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that!",
        "I hear wedding bells.",
        "Don't you mean..groomy?",
        "I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy!",
        "So you gave in and decided to call someone?",
        "Thank you?",
        "Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want s*x or did you do something bad?",
        "Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still ok.",
        "Okay...",
        "I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?",
        "Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.",
        "You heard him! \"No bigger!\" \"You're perfect!\" \"Just don't get any bigger!\" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler.",
        "Honey?",
        "About that? Erm...I'm going to change.",
        "I'm going to get bigger!",
        "Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger too.",
        "It's kind of a package deal!",
        "I thought I was something that we both wanted!",
        "Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money.",
        "Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!",
        "We're all sorry... (They have a group hug)",
        "Ok.",
        "But ehm...what is it not?",
        "And what else is it not?",
        "Very good! (Gives him the keys) What do you need it for anyway?",
        "Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buy some tickets myself!",
        "Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.",
        "How do you know she's gonna start talking?",
        "God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.",
        "Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only way I could win something?",
        "(smiling)That was a good day!",
        "I'm parked in a garage on Morton!",
        "(to Ross)So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?",
        "Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.",
        "Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up your pants!",
        "Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.",
        "Alright, who wants to do it?",
        "Ok, hey Rach?",
        "Well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing for the same thing, right?",
        "Right! .. but we \"know\" what you're wishing for!",
        "I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?",
        "Please, just do it!",
        "You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.",
        "Because I know that you think the lottery is \"boohaki\" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.",
        "Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!",
        "Come on, lottery!! (everybody cheers)",
        "Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this? (doesn't let them answer) Ok, how about this: we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first.",
        "I'm sorry, idea time is over.",
        "Yeah.",
        "There are no tickets on the nightstand!",
        "Un, no you didn't! You must be mistaken!",
        "Chandler, sense the tone!!",
        "Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.",
        "Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!",
        "When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!",
        "Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!",
        "Ahhh! (shocked)",
        "There's the man I married!!",
        "Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!",
        "No, no! We should divide them up (picks up the bowl) and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!",
        "Friends!",
        "Money! (they all look at her) Friends...",
        "They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra (takes some tickets out of her bra and gives them to Phoebe)...",
        "Phoebe, we lost half of them.",
        "Oh, play them!",
        "Oh God, I am so sorry honey...",
        "(she hugs Chandler) Honey, you've been really strong about this, I know how badly you wanted that job.",
        "(she draws out a ticket from a pocket of her pants) 131! (they kiss)",
        "We are on a roll, people!!",
        "Check your numbers! Make me rich!",
        "Make me rich!!",
        "Just double checking (does so)...no, no, no...(takes off a shoe and takes a ticket out of it) No!",
        "(answering phone) Hello? Hold on. It's your boss.",
        "Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!",
        "You bet! No TV or anything! (she gets up from the sofa and goes to the kitchen area)",
        "Let me see!",
        "You know what? You can have mine.",
        "Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better?",
        "Ok, you got it!",
        "Really? If that's what you want...",
        "Damn it! Rookie mistake!",
        "Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as... (reads from the screen) \"gay as the day is long\"?",
        "But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true. (Phone rings)",
        "(On the phone) Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?",
        "What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!",
        "Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want. (pause) Give me your phone.",
        "And now your cell.",
        "This is your cellphone?",
        "This is your current cellphone?",
        "Phoebe, where's your purse?",
        "No, no! Give it to me!",
        "Give it to me!",
        "I'll go in there.",
        "Phoebe come here",
        "Haha!",
        "Haha!",
        "So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.",
        "Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.",
        "Who's that? (goes to open door)",
        "(To Mike) What are you doing here?",
        "Phoebe!",
        "Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?",
        "Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!",
        "(to Mike) This doesn't concern you!!",
        "Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.",
        "Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend (to Phoebe) and Mike's friend (Mike is sceptical).",
        "Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend! (sits herself down between them)",
        "I've been pretty good!",
        "Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!",
        "You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!",
        "Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it.",
        "(running back into the room) Kiss him, you fool!!",
        "Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!",
        "Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!",
        "Excuse me?",
        "Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.",
        "You didn't hear the speech!",
        "Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless!",
        "You're... weird!",
        "Oh (realizes her pants are undone and zips them up)!",
        "Damn it!",
        "And I blame you too.",
        "Hi, glad you could come.",
        "So, did you know Ross well?",
        "(a bit surprised) Yes, he is. Me.",
        "I look like a man??",
        "You are married though.",
        "It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.",
        "Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey, what's this?",
        "Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage chains.",
        "Do you wanna go hunting?",
        "And she wants to go hunting, too!!",
        "(entering) Hey honey! I missed you today!",
        "Yeah. (they kiss) What d'you wanna do tonight?",
        "Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience! Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank.",
        "Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.",
        "What is the big deal?",
        "It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?",
        "Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think it's a good idea!",
        "(really embarrassed) OH!",
        "Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody is gonna wanna watch that.",
        "Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going to be ok?",
        "I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even knows you!",
        "Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!",
        "This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to! (leaves)",
        "So, what's your name?",
        "Hey sweetie.",
        "With good news? (very quickly and wringing hands) Of course it is not good news, you just said (deadpan) \"Doctor Connelly just called\". If it was good news you would have said (excitedly) \"Doctor Connelly just called! \" But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem with me or with you?",
        "What?",
        "Oh... what does that mean?",
        "Chandler?",
        "(weeping) Oh my God!",
        "I'm sorry too.",
        "(still weeping) I know.",
        "It sounds interesting!",
        "Yeah.",
        "No, I don't think it ever works. Why?",
        "No, no, Rachel?",
        "Who do you wanna fool around with?",
        "(whispering) You can't!",
        "In the hall.",
        "You wanna fool around with Joey?",
        "Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?",
        "Who, who are they?",
        "Both of them?",
        "Which one?",
        "Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.",
        "What the hell are you cooking!",
        "Hey!",
        "What's so bad about that?",
        "(fingering her elbow): Ross?",
        "(to Chandler) Is he gonna introduce us?",
        "(to chandler) Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.",
        "(to Ross) So, did you two have fun?",
        "And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a (aloud) HOTTY!! (Charlie looks at her) HI!",
        "Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec?",
        "You're not sick!",
        "Ok, then, why are you... (she opens her robe revealing a nice black dress) all dressed up??",
        "You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!",
        "Ok, what is this?",
        "(aloud) WHAT?",
        "Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!",
        "The game's over! Take off your robe!",
        "Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!",
        "(Yells after him) I love you!",
        "Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.",
        "(Excited) Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself.",
        "(Shocked) Oh my God! Chandler!",
        "(to Rachel) Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this \"best wishes\" crap. I want \"love\".",
        "Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!",
        "(yelling after him) We will!!",
        "(to Rachel) Look at you with all the guys!",
        "I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?",
        "Please... Chandler is the love of my life... (At which point a man in leather pants walks by)... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! (Follows the man in the leather)",
        "That's it, just sign right on the bra (the actor does so).",
        "Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year!",
        "Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.",
        "You really liked it?",
        "Oh really!",
        "No!",
        "So I got it when I was 13...",
        "Hey!",
        "No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.",
        "That's different! I was drunk and stupid!",
        "What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?",
        "Alright (shrugs). I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.",
        "And I can't stop you.",
        "Oh, you're so wonderful.",
        "Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!",
        "Hi.",
        "Ok.",
        "Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.",
        "(long pause) Ok.",
        "Hi honey!",
        "Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!",
        "I got it.",
        "Yeah, I guess.",
        "(turns around and she's quite shocked) Excuse me?",
        "Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! \"Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm\"!",
        "Chandler!",
        "I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!",
        "Uh!",
        "Tell me about yourself, Zack!",
        "Hey guys! Dinner's ready!",
        "Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!",
        "I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.",
        "Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?",
        "Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?",
        "We're just making conversation. (Chandler makes an agreeing-sound)",
        "Yess!! (M & C high-five and Zack looks confused again)",
        "Does seem pretty perfect.",
        "(pause) No.",
        "No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.",
        "No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.",
        "Yeah, I'm sure.",
        "That is so sweet. I love you. (they kiss)",
        "Adoption.",
        "I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.",
        "So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?",
        "(excitedly) Oh my God, we're gonna be parents!",
        "And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there (they go look through the window) our baby could be being conceived.",
        "Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.You wanna...? (plays with her finger on Chandlers chest)",
        "I'll put a pillowcase over my head.",
        "What's up?",
        "Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls.",
        "Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I hear someone else in there with him.",
        "Oh my God, that's Charlie!",
        "I'm not sure about this.",
        "No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!",
        "What?",
        "(in her Monica-excited-way... TOO LOUD!) Oh my God, I love how thin these walls are!",
        "(muffled) Thank you.",
        "I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?",
        "I'm on it!",
        "I think I hear curtains closing...",
        "Bedsprings, unmistakable!",
        "Not until you said it. Somebody switch! (Chandler makes a clicking sound with his fingers and Phoebe runs to the other wall. Monica returns to Chandlers wall.) Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people leaving with the same person we came with.",
        "Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.",
        "Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!",
        "(also hugs the wall) Yeah, we had a great time, thank you! (walks to Phoebe)",
        "Other wall, people! Other wall!",
        "Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?",
        "Check it out!",
        "What do you think?",
        "Don't you just love it?",
        "And listen to this... (shakes her body so the shells tingle)",
        "Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these... (plays with her hair to make the shells tingle again) Ow!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this. (she pushes Chandler on the couch and brushes her hair and shells against Chandler's chest) You like that, right? (again, she brushes her hair against his chest and hums...)",
        "It's \"Bolero\" from \"10\".",
        "You what? You said you liked them.",
        "Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.",
        "You know what? I don't care. I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this... (and she shakes her head more violently) OUCH!",
        "And the eye!",
        "Not really.",
        "I have a problem.",
        "Well, I was dancing around, and singing \"No Woman, No Cry\" and I got stuck.",
        "Oh, well, I can move... (she moves back and forth the shower curtain rail, opening and closing the shower curtain with her hair as she goes)",
        "(looking disappointed) I guess so...",
        "Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.",
        "Look what I found in the drawer... (Chandler looks up from his book.) And you said I'd never wear this...",
        "Sure, what do you have in mind?",
        "Really? I don't really feel like it.",
        "Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.",
        "David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.",
        "(to Chandler) See?",
        "Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.",
        "(pinching her) Let's get you out of here!! (they go outside)",
        "At least you took me down with you!",
        "I guess, in time.",
        "I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone.",
        "Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.",
        "Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.",
        "What? (looks very shocked) Why?",
        "Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?",
        "They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say \"No\", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again.",
        "Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!",
        "(to Chandler) Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!",
        "(shouts to Chandler) And make sure our room isn't next to theirs (points to Phoebe).",
        "Yeah, right!",
        "Ok!",
        "See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?",
        "Ok fine. I'll handle this. (goes to Phoebe who's talking to Rachel) Phoebe?",
        "(looking very serious) I need to talk to you.",
        "Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight.",
        "What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha... What about Mike?",
        "Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?",
        "Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole \"I never want to get married\" thing and step up!",
        "This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say \"yes\" but I know she really wants to be with you!",
        "I... I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair! (Tries to move her huge hair away from the phone, in vain)",
        "You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you, you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity? (Mike hangs up the phone) Damnit!",
        "(sarcastically) Well, I hope you're happy!",
        "Phoebe is going to say \"Yes\" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!",
        "No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike!",
        "No, I called him. It's not gonna happen.",
        "Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!",
        "I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.",
        "Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.",
        "IT'S THE HUMIDITY!",
        "You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you? (Phoebe looks very flattered) Now, I don't actually have a ring...",
        "(to everybody) BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright?",
        "I know (she snuggles to him)",
        "The sun is out!",
        "Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.",
        "Damn it!",
        "Yeah!",
        "(her hair bigger then before) I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!",
        "So, what are we gonna do today?",
        "(pleasantly surprised) Ping pong? (to Chandler) Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!",
        "(disappointed) Why not?",
        "I'm not always that bad!",
        "(hesitatingly) I punched you...?",
        "... Phoebe...?",
        "I clunked your heads together!",
        "C'mon guys, it'll be fun!",
        "But then how do we know who wins?",
        "So, we're just four losers... SUPER!",
        "(smiling) OK!",
        "Sure! Got to!",
        "Aww!",
        "Hell, yeah!",
        "How much were you thinking?",
        "Make it fifty!",
        "(nearly shouting) One thousand...",
        "(going through her pockets) No... (to Chandler and Phoebe) Either of you girls got a quarter?",
        "Heads! No, Tails! He-he-heads!",
        "(angry) Ow, what are the chances!",
        "Ha! My point!",
        "Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!",
        "Ah, yeah!",
        "Ah, yeaaah!",
        "AH YEAAAAH!",
        "Oh, damn it!",
        "(threatening) Don't get too cocky! Remember I won the last one! Oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?",
        "NO, NO, NOOO!",
        "Best out of three?",
        "(to Mike) Serve the ball, chump!",
        "No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!",
        "I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!",
        "Look! You knew this about me when you married me! You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. Well, this is my sickness!",
        "That's just good sense!",
        "(in pain) Aww! (she holds her hand, moaning like she's biting back a scream)",
        "No, no, no. Honey, I'm ok. Shake it off! (she shakes the wrist and it's more painful) Oh, no! No shaking, no shaking! Ooh! Ooh! (pause) Oh my God! I can't play!",
        "I can't believe it! (pause) I lost!",
        "What?",
        "(to Chandler) Honey, you don't have to do this.",
        "But... you suck!",
        "Oh my God! You're good!",
        "(to Chandler) Oh my God. That was so amazing! When did you (pause) Hold on! I almost forgot (she turns to Mike) loser! (back to Chandler) When did you stop sucking?",
        "Why?",
        "This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "(to Chandler) Hey sweetie! (they kiss)",
        "Chandler gets pedicures!",
        "There. Here's their card.",
        "Hey Phoebe!",
        "I know, Amanda! Ah! She called me too! She's the worst!",
        "She's this girl who used to live in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message. (she apes Amanda using an awful British accent) \"Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!\"",
        "(pause) (to Phoebe) Chandler gets pedicures!",
        "I know, and she's always bragging about all the famous people she's met.",
        "Oh, what are we gonna do! I don't wanna see her!!",
        "What?",
        "Oh, I guess we could try that, but... it seems so harsh! (to Chandler) Have you ever done that?",
        "Monica’s apartment. Monica and Phoebe are reading magazines when the phone rings and Phoebe reaches to pick it up]\nMonica: (to Phoebe) No, no, don’t get it. Let the machine pick up.",
        "It could be Amanda!",
        "You're from Yonkers! Your last name is Buffo-Martisis!",
        "We weren’t picking up, it’s Amanda!",
        "Hi Amanda! Actually now... it’s... is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night? (Phoebe mouths 'no') Ok, Phoebe and I will see you then!",
        "Well, I said 'no' to her coming over now! I couldn’t say 'no' twice! I get this uncontrollable need to please people!",
        "And you would?",
        "How could you mess this up? It's so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!",
        "One Two Three...",
        "Wow, really? One time he just looked at my bra and it popped open.",
        "Well, you guys have been friends forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was? You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that.",
        "(sees what he is doing) Chandler, stop! It is not going to pop open!",
        "Hey Phoebe!",
        "Is Amanda here yet?",
        "(sits down) Oh good. Good, look I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan. Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.",
        "Well, what do you think of Mike and Chandler being in a car accident?",
        "Hi!",
        "(beaming) Yeah! Yeah! His name is Chandler and...",
        "When were we not friends?",
        "Ehm, we were friends in 1992.",
        "(To Phoebe) You were going to cut me out?",
        "Oh My God!",
        "(Into the phone) Hello? Chandler, what's wrong? (She listens) Oh my God, are you alright? (listens some more) Yeah, I'll be right there. (She hangs up and speaks to Amanda) I'm so sorry, but Chandler was in a car accident. (She gets up)",
        "Nope! (She turns and leaves)",
        "We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.",
        "I have nothing to say to you.",
        "I can't believe you tried to cut me out. Why Phoebe, why?",
        "I'm still all those things!",
        "(starts smiling) I am scrappy.",
        "It's because I'm scrappy.",
        "I won't know what I would do without you.",
        "Well, I guess we should go back in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.",
        "(she enters) Hey guys!",
        "That place in Vermont? You can take a hint!",
        "Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?",
        "Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.",
        "All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.",
        "Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that!",
        "Hey!",
        "All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!",
        "Are you freaking kidding me, Green?",
        "So glad you came!",
        "I can't believe Emma is still asleep!",
        "I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!",
        "Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike there when I was a kid.",
        "Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?",
        "Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!",
        "We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!",
        "Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour.",
        "Alright, 5 more minutes.",
        "No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us (Points at herself and Chandler) We've been complaining the longest!",
        "No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.",
        "Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right now!",
        "No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.",
        "(She gives Joey a you-are-so-stupid-look) Ok, ten.",
        "Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday. We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!",
        "Everybody get your toys! (They all run toward the table with toys)",
        "Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go (Takes two cups and marks the start and finish lines with them) from here to here. Now the one who comes in last, stays!",
        "(to the dog) What are you barking at?",
        "Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?",
        "No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose. (turns to Chandler) The rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically...",
        "Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.",
        "Game?",
        "That's how old you are.",
        "(embraces Emma tightly) Ooh, I want one...",
        "...and head to Canada!",
        "I wasn't. Let's get going!",
        "What about your massage client?",
        "Thanks!",
        "What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?",
        "Hey, you wanna go to see a movie?",
        "Oh, right.",
        "Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!",
        "Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you to give up?",
        "Who's Gladys? (Phoebe shows her a horrific painting with a half-a-body girl dummy coming out of the frame. Monica's frightened and she gasps.) Oh! What a tragic loss!",
        "(faking happiness) Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know...",
        "Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!",
        "Absolutely! Yes, you say to him \"I'm sorry Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!\"",
        "Damn it, I did not think this through!\n[Scene: Central Perk. Rachel, Joey and Emma are there.]",
        "Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you keep the painting?",
        "Wow, what's the bad news!",
        "Huh!",
        "You know, I would give her up, for you.",
        "But I want to.",
        "But I insist!",
        "No, that landed in your food!",
        "(faking happiness) Oh, my!",
        "(sounds desperate, knowing what Rachel is trying to do) I haven't really settled on a spot yet!",
        "(offended) I like that poster!",
        "(Impatient with Rachel) Are you still here?",
        "Hey! I sold that to Joey.",
        "No, too late. You can't give it back! (she pushes the painting back to Rachel)",
        "No you can't. She's yours!",
        "SHE'S YOURS!",
        "She's m-i-i-ne!",
        "She's mine!",
        "She's mine!",
        "She's mine!",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us.",
        "Thank you!",
        "Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much \"with the words\".",
        "Clearly we were wrong.",
        "You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it.",
        "Wow! Don't you look nice?!",
        "You guys do that? Chandler won't even have s*x in our bathroom!",
        "(also reading it) It doesn’t make any sense.",
        "Alright, what was this sentence originally? (shows the sentence to Joey)",
        "Hey Joey, I don’t think we can use this.",
        "Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani (Joey makes a 'and-what’s-wrong-with-that' look). Hey, why don’t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!",
        "Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song.",
        "Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?",
        "Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!",
        "I proposed to Chandler! (Phoebe stops herself from laughing) Alright, moving on...",
        "Thank you.",
        "How about at a game, on the big screen?",
        "What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, plus he'd never suspect it!",
        "No, sorry sweety..",
        "You dropped it off?",
        "You hand-wrote it?",
        "Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!",
        "Okay good.",
        "Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.",
        "What?",
        "(surprised) They thought Joey was a child?",
        "Hey, what did you guys do today?",
        "Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.",
        "I'm a cool, fun aunt!",
        "God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.",
        "Hey.",
        "That's sweet. Drink your hair.",
        "Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.",
        "That's not really how it works.",
        "I don't know!",
        "Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?",
        "Hi Frank.",
        "Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!",
        "Which one is which again?",
        "Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.",
        "Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.",
        "Oh my god!",
        "Thank you. (To Chandler.) I think I just had a tiny orgasm.",
        "It's.. It's just so pretty and white.",
        "Can I adopt you?",
        "They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?",
        "Why? What did you do in the bathroom?",
        "Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!",
        "Hey, Phoebs",
        "Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate us.",
        "What?",
        "Hey!",
        "Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.",
        "She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.",
        "And a lot could still get in our way.",
        "Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!",
        "You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby!",
        "Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and (to Chandler) you're gonna be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm gonna get me... A BABY! {she leaves)",
        "Ok, thank you.(the man leaves) Uh, well this is it. Are you OK?",
        "Uh, we're gonna be great.",
        "Well... obviously!",
        "Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.",
        "I don't know about that.",
        "(overlapping) Let her finish, doctor.",
        "Amen.",
        "Uh, good hands. (she holds Chandler hands) Healing hands.",
        "It says “Do it!”. And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.",
        "Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.",
        "We don’t?",
        "Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! (to Chandler, who looks bewildered). Did you hear that?",
        "(to Erica) Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. (they hugs). You are SO going to Heaven!",
        "Why not?",
        "God works in mysterious ways.",
        "But she liked us.",
        "Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor. (looks very convinced about what she just said)",
        "C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.",
        "(very emotional) Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.",
        "I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?",
        "(Almost crying) Please.. please, we are so close.",
        "(realizes Chandler is right. She's almost crying) okay, right. (They hug)",
        "(sniffing) Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?",
        "Technicality!",
        "(pointing to a picture on the table) I-Is... Is that a picture?",
        "Look, doctor!",
        "Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby. (holds up the sonogram)",
        "Well, we... (makes quotation signs in the air) \"bore false witness\"... See I could be a reverend.",
        "But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...",
        "Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...",
        "God bless you Chandler Bing!",
        "(sarcastically) We?",
        "And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.",
        "Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... p0rn or cigarettes?",
        "Chandler?",
        "Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?",
        "It isn't mine!",
        "Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!",
        "Ok.",
        "We’re waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I’m glad you’re here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this (she puts a box on the table and opens it). I don’t know if you wanna use it, but…",
        "I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!",
        "That’s crazy! (Phoebe looks bewildered). I am sorry. I just can’t imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!",
        "That’s right. You’re making a commitment and that’s the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?",
        "Ow! (Chandler slaps her on her back) Oh, that sounds nice! I am just there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!",
        "Yay!",
        "Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids!",
        "Hi, I am Monica and this is Chandler. Please come in.",
        "Would you like something to drink?",
        "Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We’re really excited about getting this process started.",
        "Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.",
        "Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby before\nthem. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs. (Laura looks shocked)",
        "Really? What is it?",
        "Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?",
        "Keep on roaming Bert! We don't want any crazy today!",
        "Oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to look under any of the furniture,\nbecause, believe me, you won't find any p0rn or cigarettes under there!",
        "(Pulls Laura into the spare room) Why don't I show you the baby's room?",
        "So that was the baby's room. (They come out and Chandler throws Joey behind\nthe couch and puts his foot on him. Monica looks at Chandler)",
        "(To Chandler) What room should we see next?",
        "(laughs nervously as well, Laura looks confused) (To Laura) Some people don't\nget him, but I think he's really funny! (She takes Laura to their own bedroom).",
        "Yeah, that we totally understand. Dating is hard.",
        "Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler... Ok, goodbye. (hangs up)",
        "It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list.",
        "Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. Oh...",
        "Hey guys!",
        "We need to talk to you about something.",
        "No, it's not!",
        "Thank you, Pheebs!",
        "What? You are way off, lady!",
        "That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!",
        "Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!",
        "You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?",
        "No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.",
        "2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, I see you guys at 4.",
        "This dinner is gonna be so great! In your face, last year \"me\"!",
        "(Chandler's laughing) Did someone drop the baton again?",
        "(she tastes what she has cooked) I don't get older. I just get better!",
        "You don't know that.",
        "Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!",
        "Name one of his books.",
        "Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...",
        "Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.",
        "Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.",
        "Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these (she gives Chandler a bowl with cranberries. Then, while she's going outside, she sees him with a bottle of soap in his hands) Not with soap!! (she leaves)",
        "Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!",
        "Do you hear something? (Chandlers stands up and goes to the door to look out from the peephole)",
        "Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!",
        "(gasps) Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!",
        "Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!",
        "No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.",
        "(Rolling her eyes) Nothing. It's fine.",
        "That's all the turkey you're gonna get.",
        "Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.",
        "Stinky?!",
        "Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made 'em!",
        "Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.",
        "(Gets up) Okay, okay. You two (to Phoebe and Rachel) go get the dessert. And I'll let you in.",
        "Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?",
        "Grand Supreme Little Darling?",
        "Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.",
        "It's too late for apologies.",
        "The three of us?",
        "Joey, that is not gonna work.",
        "Alright, well, this does not change anything. (to Chandler) Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face.",
        "Bring it.",
        "Here you go!",
        "Okay, try it.",
        "Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain.",
        "Chandler, where are your tools?",
        "I do, but Rachel borrowed them.",
        "Oh!",
        "Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.",
        "(very emotional) I don't care.",
        "That was the adoption agency...",
        "WE'RE GETTING A BABY!",
        "There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us!",
        "This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!",
        "I can't believe they called, and we're actually getting a baby. (she kisses Chandler)",
        "(really excited) Mmh... this cake is amazing!",
        "I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time!",
        "(with no hesitation) s*x!",
        "Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said \"s*x\" I wasn't thinking about \"s*x with you\"!",
        "Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes.",
        "Nancy doesn’t smoke!",
        "So? What do you think of the house?",
        "Isn’t it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?",
        "Don’t you love the huge yard?",
        "And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!",
        "So? Do you think we should get it?",
        "I think we should.",
        "This is huge!",
        "How bad you wanna smoke, right now.",
        "Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?",
        "Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.",
        "If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!",
        "No, he’s picking up dinner, why, what’s up?",
        "What?",
        "Oh my God! Oh my God that’s awful! What did you think of the house?",
        "Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously... (to the rest) Did you think the neighborhood was homey? (Chandler enters)",
        "(goes to Chandler) Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.",
        "(turns to them) Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.",
        "Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.",
        "When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.",
        "And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...",
        "And about an hour ago, we made an offer.",
        "(smiling) It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees... (gets cut off)",
        "We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there. (Points to Rachel and Phoebe) It is beautiful, isn't it?",
        "Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...",
        "Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.",
        "Every year.",
        "Hey, did you get the turkey bast-Oh my God! Oh my God! (She sees someone is stuck in the turkey.) Who is that?",
        "I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?",
        "Deal!",
        "Maurice.",
        "It’s umm, it has something to do with transponding.",
        "That’s not even a word!",
        "NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!",
        "Hey, we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question wrong!",
        "(She opens the door.) Hey Ross. What's up bro?",
        "I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too.",
        "Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, \"What were you thinking?\"",
        "Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I’d like.",
        "When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.",
        "When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.",
        "And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. (To Rachel) (Starts to cry) You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! (They both break down in tears.)",
        "She really left.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Can I ask you a question?",
        "What the hell is that dog doing here?! (She notices the dog sitting in the living room.)",
        "And?",
        "We can't afford that.",
        "Well, there you go.",
        "Yeah, we'll be okay.",
        "I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... I love that one so much.",
        "What?",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Oh my God! My God! We've got the house !?",
        "And a baby...",
        "We sure are.",
        "(quickly) Not it!",
        "Rachel, this is yours.",
        "All right, everybody open them!",
        "I know.",
        "Enjoy!",
        "Hey, let me tell them!",
        "Joey is gonna be a celebrity guest on a game show!",
        "(stopping Joey from answering) Ohh! Fish, seaweed, a sunken ship.",
        "Oh, that was our favourite game show ever!",
        "Or \"Win, Lose or Draw\".",
        "Oh, I can't. We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette party.",
        "Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.",
        "Yeah, we used to perform for our family and friends.",
        "(singing) \"I'm a little bit country\"...",
        "(to Rachel) Hey, where is this guy, it's been over an hour!",
        "Who is it?",
        "What's the matter, officer? Has someone been bad? (looks over to Phoebe and she opens the door, and to their dismay, the stripper is an old, short, fat guy who looks exhausted)",
        "Are you gonna be ok, officer, uhm,...",
        "...If-you-say-so.",
        "Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!",
        "Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!",
        "(walks towards Phoebe and the stripper) Uh, look, officer... uhm Sir...",
        "I can't believe we are at a real college party! (Rachel laughs excitedly) I have to pee so bad!",
        "Hey, you've got a boyfriend!",
        "Look, there's Chandler. You knew, that stupid friend of Ross'. Said I'm fat. You know I've already lost 4 pounds!",
        "I KNOW!",
        "Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you (rolls her eyes) NOT. (she and Rachel giggle a little and Chandler looks unimpressed)",
        "Oh my God Rach. Bean bag chairs.",
        "Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days.",
        "That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all. (Chandler approaches)",
        "For your information, ass munch, I've lost four pounds. Maybe even five with all the dancing. (A guy enters holding a pizza box)",
        "Oh THATS ME! (she runs to the pizza guy)",
        "She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.",
        "What? When was this?",
        "Oh my God! That's wild!",
        "Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.",
        "(screeching) OH! Oh, oh! (holding her hand in front of her mouth)",
        "YES! (Chandler gets an \"oh no!\" look on his face)",
        "I was the pile of coats!",
        "You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?",
        "You were my first kiss ever?",
        "Oh, crap!",
        "(she enters with a headset on and she's speaking into the microphone) Well, it matters to me!",
        "Did you just hung up on me? (she hangs up too) All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.",
        "You don't know military time?",
        "Just subtract twelve.",
        "(screaming) Six o'clock!",
        "Ok. Hold on. (her mobile phone rings) Geller here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye. (she hangs up) Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?",
        "Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.",
        "Ooh... she backed out.",
        "I made her. (Phoebe looks shocked) Steel drums don't really say \"elegant wedding\". Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.",
        "(coming) Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the time! (she takes off)",
        "(looking at Phoebe eating something) Pheebs, spit that out, that has pork in it.",
        "Yeah, I changed them. I-I sent you a fax about it!",
        "Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!",
        "Ok, it's 2100 hours. (to Phoebe) Time for your toast. (Mike appears)",
        "You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! (to Phoebe and Mike). Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing and get out!",
        "(very serious) It's 2101 and I am not amused. (pause). Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say. (Everyone sits and Phoebe gets up)",
        "What?",
        "Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back.",
        "Oh, is that so? Ok. If that's really what you want, then here... I give you the headset. Well, I don't really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages. (hands her a stack of papers with messages and calls to return)",
        "Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine.",
        "Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.",
        "Hi.",
        "She's in her room, why?",
        "I know.",
        "Bye.",
        "(Obviously enjoying this setback) Ugh, I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address. (by now she can barely keep herself from smiling) Uh! What a pickle.",
        "(enjoying what she's seeing) How's it going?",
        "What?",
        "(Sounds moved) Really?",
        "You really want me to come back?",
        "Ok people, we are back in business! (Gets her headset out of her purse) Oh God, we've missed you soo much! (takes all the notes from Phoebe) Ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I'll take care of everything.",
        "Ooh! But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from New Jersey!",
        "(Putting down her phone) Well, the club lost it's power.",
        "(thinking) AFFIRMATIVE!",
        "(walking around with her headset still on) OK LET'S GET THESE CHAIRS OUT HERE! Gunther, hit the Christmas lights. (He does so and the lights above the chairs light up. Monica looks satisfied) Okay, who left the ice sculpture (picks up a piece of ice from the ground) ON THE STEAM GRATE? (nobody answers)",

        "So, you're ready to do this?",
        "I love you. (Phoebe leans in to kiss her.) Oh, wait, wait, wait! No hugs. The dresses... Oh what the hell. (the girls hug)",
        "I love you.",

        "Yeah, you really shouldn't. (to Ross, sarcastically) By the way, how was that year-long dig in Cairo?",
        "Hey.",

        "Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting.",

        "Ok, so you've done some good work! (pause) What about your carry-ons?",
        "Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you! (they hug)",

        "You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?",
        "Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.",
        "Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.",
        "Ross! She's giving us her baby. She can eat you if she wants.",
        "Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name.",
        "Yeah, it takes two incomes.",
        "Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room.",
        "Mhm, helpful brother - creepy loner at teen movie.",
        "From?",
        "All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these yahoos!",
        "Hey! Where's Mike?",
        "Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy: smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust, kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a questionable orange.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Come here, I'll make you a drink.",
        "Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these (she holds the furry handcuffs) on my pillow.",
        "What are you talking about? These aren't mine.",
        "That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.",
        "Rachel used to live in that room.",
        "Joey's bare ass!",
        "Yeah?",
        "Sure.",
        "No.",
        "I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too.",

        "What?",
        "That is so sweet. (they hug)",
        "(to Ross) So, I guess you're next. You're ready?",
        "You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.",
        "Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.",
        "Yeah. Mine too.",
        "And say what? \"You owe me a goodbye\", I mean, he's got more pride than that.",
        "I hope Ross isn't too upset.",
        "Uh, where do you think you're going?",
        "We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.",
        "Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.",
        "Okay, we're gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?",
        "Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.",
        "You did? How?",
        "Oh my God! Let me see. (they all look at the pictures)",
        "Nana liked it rough!",
        "Erica, are you okay?",
        "Oh my God!",
        "She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor.",
        "All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. Ooh! (she's hyperventilating)",
        "Okay, okay... Okay, I feel a little better.",
        "Oh... Yes, I'm sure. Oh honey, let's go. Okay bye everyone.",
        "Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive...",
        "I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.",
        "How is that gonna happen?",
        "You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?",
        "Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.",
        "But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?",
        "That's terrible!",
        "Joey's gonna be *so* upset.",
        "Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?",
        "What if he reads it in the paper?",
        "Hi. We’re buying the house next door, and we were wondering if we could just take a look around.\nLady: Oh, sure. I’m showing it to someone else right now, but please, look around.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave! What a hole!",
        "Love it!",
        "They could be our neighbors, what are they like?",
        "No, actually, we're buying the house next door. (Janice gasps)",
        "(looks confused and scared) I don't know why.",
        "Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.",
        "(Thinks a little more) Okay, Okay, (clapping her hands) All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house.",
        "Okay, you come up with an idea.",
        "But we love our house.",
        "Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body. (She shows this with her index finger, mimicking it pushing something up)",
        "Erica, are you okay?",
        "Oh my God!",
        "She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor!",
        "Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good.",
        "No, last time you said it like Dracula, and it scared her! Can I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?",
        "Alright, I'll be right back.",
        "To use the bathroom.",
        "What?",
        "What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?",
        "You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.",
        "It's just a little bit more, honey.",
        "Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!",
        "Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your child! It's the miracle of life!",
        "It's a... It's a boy!",
        "Oh, you did it!",
        "(to her son) Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! (To Chandler, on the verge of tears) Oh, we are so lucky!",
        "(To Erica) Oh my God, he's beautiful. Thank you so much.",
        "I... I'm sorry, who should be along in a what now?",
        "We only ordered one!",
        "(to the doctor) Wait, did you know it was twins?",
        "(to Erica) Anybody tell you?",
        "This is unbelievable.",
        "What do you mean \"what do we do\"?",
        "Chandler, you're panicking!",
        "We can't split them up!",
        "Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?",
        "Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.",
        "That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't care if the entire cast of \"Eight is Enough\" comes out of there! We are taking them home, because they are our children!",
        "Okay!",
        "Do you think they recognize each other from in there?",
        "There's something that we wanna tell you. We decided to name the girl-baby Erica.",
        "Son of a gun, it is!",
        "Okay, well, bye!",
        "We'll call you!",
        "Oh, look at these little bunnies!",
        "Okay.",
        "Alright, let's see..",
        "Yeah, I'm good.",
        "Yes, it's twins!",
        "(points at the baby she's holding) This is a boy, (points at the baby Chandler is holding) and that's a girl.",
        "Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.",
        "I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.",
        "I love you.",
        "Call us when you get there.",
        "Now, that you can do.",
        "Oh, great! Just what you want for a new house with infants. Bird feces.",
        "Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins.",
        "Oh God! What did I just step on?",
        "Oh..",
        "I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor.",
        "Hello.",
        "Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises the twins are making. Listen.",
        "Oh, I'm sorry. Shoot, they were doing it before.",
        "Oh, wait, wait, wait! Here they go again.",
        "Isn't that cute?",
        "Oh, okay. Alright, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40.",
        "That's what it says here. Flight 421, leaves at 8:40, Newark airport.",
        "Newark airport. Why, where are you?",
        "Hey! Did you find them?",
        "Oh, well sure. This gotta be so hard. I'll do it. Gimme!",
        "Alright. My job here is done.",
        "Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.",
        "Well, that's it. Everything's packed.",
        "I know.",
        "I put three lasagnas in your freezer.",
        "Okay, please be careful with that. It was my grandmother's. Be careful.",
        "If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.",
        "Oh, yeah, that's true.",
        "Wait a minute. What about that summer during college that you lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer?",
        "Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys.",

        "That's nice.",
        "Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.",
        "He should take the sack?",
        "Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking. Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?",
        "I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.",
        "When's that?",
        "Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?",
        "What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.",
        "Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?",
        "Hey.",
        "Your sister stood me up the other night.",
        "I've been trying for two days. When I call the restaurant, they say she's too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off.",
        "Urs, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you.",
        "No, no, no, don't say \"listen\". I know that \"listen\". I've said that \"listen\".",
        "I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?",
        "You don't drink",
        "Urs--",
        "Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?",
        "No. No, I, I couldn't do that.",
        "Then, uh, then I'm sorry.",
        "I know. I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or what, but you have never looked so beautiful.",
        "Pheebs?",

        "Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!",
        "Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.",
        "Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.",
        "Maybe she never got your message.",
        "He's back! The peeper's back!",
        "(DUCKING) Get down!",
        "(INTRIGUED) Yeah?",
        "..Naughty!",

        "Hey, you know our phone's not working?",
        "I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.",
        "Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?",
        "(TO MONICA) Can I use your phone? (ON PHONE) Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.",

        "No no no no no, I'm not fallin' for that again.",
        "Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?",
        "Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey says hello. He'll know what it means.",
        "Can we see her?",
        "How're you doing?",
        "Ooh, that bad, huh? Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.",
        "You gotta tell Ross how you feel.",
        "What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.",
        "Look, Rache, Rache, I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.",

        "No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.",
        "That's how they do pants. First they go up one side, they move it over, they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?",
        "What? That's not? Oh my god.",
        "Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...",
        "I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.",
        "I gotta get one, too.",
        "Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.",
        "Uh, does it hurt?",
        "Chandler?",
        "Ok, I got one, I got one. If he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?",
        "Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?",
        "Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle.",
        "Who?",
        "What's he doin' in my section?",
        "Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'?",
        "Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.",
        "Yeah. Bijan for men?",
        "Bijan for men? Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work we could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.",
        "Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men?",
        "What is the big deal?",
        "Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh--",
        "Exactly.",
        "Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.",
        "Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.",
        "I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.",
        "Yeah I guess you're right.",
        "I'm gonna do it.",
        "Mornin'. I said, mornin'.",
        "Yeah, I'm ready.",
        "These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?",
        "Do we have to know about that?",
        "I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.",
        "[to the screen] Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "Hey, listen, lady....[sees that she's pregnant]...whoa.",
        "Oh yeah? And who do you like?",
        "The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?",
        "Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!",
        "Oh, oh, oh, sorry.",
        "Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin' in here.",
        "Tribbiani.",
        "[takes phone] Hi, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends. [pause] Yeah, I'm single. [pause] 25. An actor. [pause] Hello?",
        "Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?",
        "Ok, look, maybe I should just go.",
        "Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?",
        "You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.",
        "Oh, it is.",
        "It is.",
        "Ew! What is that? Something exploded!",
        "[panicked] Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?",

        "Oh, just had a baby.",
        "Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.",
        "Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.",
        "He doesn't do much, does he?",
        "Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.",
        "I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.",
        "Well... I'm helping out down at the NYU Med School with some... research.",
        "Oh, just, y'know.... science.",
        "[sigh]... It's a fertility study.",
        "Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.",
        "We make fire. Cook meat.",
        "Oh, OK.",
        "I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.",
        "What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?",
        "Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have s*x with me.",
        "Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.",
        "Hey!",
        "The country?",
        "Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?",
        "He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.",
        "Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.",
        "We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man. [Joey gives Ross a hug]",
        "Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.",
        "Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I--",
        "Then you do. Heh, heh.",
        "What do you mean?",
        "Not following you.",
        "[to Rachel]: That book got me through some tough times.",
        "[pats Chandler on the leg] That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.",
        "Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.",
        "The country.",
        "He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.",
        "Heh, heh. It was nothin'.",
        "[panicked] Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.",
        "Sure! Why not?",
        "How do you mean?",
        "Shhhh!",
        "She's still asleep.",
        "Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?",
        "Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!",
        "It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.",
        "I know! Neither did I!",
        "Seven hundred bucks!",
        "Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.",
        "What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? [Joey closes his eyes and walks around with arms spread.]",
        "Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.",
        "You guys are messin' with me, right?",
        "That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, \"whoa.\"",
        "\"Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!\"",

        "Have you been here all night?",
        "Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.",
        "All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.",
        "Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.",
        "I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.",
        "Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?",
        "You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?",

        "Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?",
        "You want his yearbook?",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..",
        "Yes!",
        "Are you really not going?",
        "Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.",
        "No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.",
        "Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.",
        "It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.",

Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.",
        "No, seriously.",
        "You wanna smell him?",
        "Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.",
        "(to Chandler) What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?",
        "Hey, hey, look at that talent.",
        "Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Get outta here. This is our stop too.",
        "Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.",
        "Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?",
        "(running after bus) Ben! Ben! Ben! ",
        "Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.",
        "Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?",
        "I'm him.",
        "Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.",
        "Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Ahh!",
        "Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.",
        "You got a better idea? ",
        "Heads.",
        "Yes! Whew!",
        "Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.",
        "Yes! There's still pie.",
        "Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today.",
        "This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?",
        "I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.",
        "I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.",
        "Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' s*x on it.",
        "What happens if you flick it?",
        "Foxy lady.",
        "The Ice Capades?",
        "I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people. [Chandler puts the tape in]",
        "Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have s*x. And then I say, wait, here's my line, [Joey from TV] you know that's bad fo r the paper tray.",
        "Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . .",
        "Me too, we should get goin'.",
        "I got time.",
        "Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?",
        "Hey.",
        "Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?",
        "You gave him cookies?",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this.",
        "I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.",
        "Hey.",
        "Hey.",
        "C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.",
        "So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . .",
        "Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!",
        "Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.",
        "She told us.",
        "Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.",
        "Phoebe here with the cab yet?",
        "Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.",
        "Hey, here she comes.",
        "Hey.",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah, big stuff.",
        "Hey. [Phoebe takes off, Joey and Chandler are thrown back in the seat]",
        "Sure is.",
        "Good luck Phoebs.",
        "How far'd ya get?",
        "Phoebs, what's goin' on?",
        "Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.",
        "Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today.",
        "Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.",
        "Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas.",
        "Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?",
        "Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright.",
        "Rach, these are for you.",
        "No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.",
        "[Chandler and Joey give Monica a pack of condoms.]\nThey're ribbed for your pleasure.",
        "Do we need a cake?",
        "All right.",
        "Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.",
        "Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying \"let's go here, let's go there\". Like we can afford to go here and there.",
        "For Ross.",
        "Hi.",
        "If it's not you, this is a horrible story.",
        "Yeah, someplace nice. (to Phoebe and Rachel) How much do you think I can get for my kidney? (at Central Perk)",
        "Cool.",
        "Sorry, sorry.",
        "What are these, like famous chickens?",
        "Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?",
        "Thank you.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you.",
        "'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--",
        "Charity.",
        "Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.",
        "Me too.",
        "Fine.",
        "Come on you guys, one more time.",
        "Nooo.",
        "Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.",
        "You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?",
        "And we don't work hard?",
        "And you feel like we hold you back.",
        "Let me get that. (to Chandler) You got five bucks?",
        "Hey.",
        "Nice, nice. Hey I got somethin' for you. [hands Chandler an envelope.",
        "Eight hundred and twelve bucks.",
        "Well, I'm makin money now and this is payin' you back for head shots, electric bills, and so many slices of pizza I can't even count. I love ya man.",
        "Hey, this is a little extra somethin' for uh, ya know, always bein' there for me. [hands Chandler a jewelry box]",
        "Heh, what d'ya say?",
        "Isn't it? And it's engraved too, check it out.",
        "Put it on.",
        "Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything. [gets the bracelet from the drawer] You put this on, you're good to go. [puts the bracelet on Chandler] Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet.",
        "You have any idea what this'll do for your s*x life?",
        "If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.",
        "Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?",
        "You know what the. . . [sees Chandler on his knees, holding the couch cushions]",
        "Hey.",
        "How come you have two?",
        "Get out.",
        "Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.",
        "[pulls out a VCR tape] Hey Monica, what's on this video tape?",
        "What is with your nose?",
        "Some girl ate Monica.",
        "Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.",
        "Alright, no peeking. No peeking, no peeking, no peeking.",
        "Alright open your eyes. [opens his eyes to see two black leather recliners and a big screen TV]",
        "Huh? Days of our Lives picked up my option.",
        "I know.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Whichever one you want, man. Whichever one you want. [Chandler starts to sit in one of the chairs] Not that one.",
        "[sits down] Ohh yeah, that's the stuff.",
        "We dare.",
        "Woah, hey, yo. [Rachel and Ross move]",
        "Hey, yo. [they move from out of in front of the TV]",
        "What if we have to pee?",
        "Wow, look at that. The car is on fire, yet somehow it's expensive paint job is protected by the Miracle Wax.",
        "Hi.",
        "Hey.",
        "What're you doin' here? Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel?",
        "She laughed at you?",
        "It certainly is a miracle.",
        "Hey.",
        "Hey, woah, hey, woah.",
        "No, inside good, outside bad.",
        "[uses a dentist mirror to see] Naa, she's lyin'.",
        "Is that the fire alarm?",
        "Cool.",
        "Huh? So whaddya think? Casa de Joey. Huh? I decorated it myself.",
        "Art.",
        "Thanks, yeah. I love this but ya know what, it makes me wanna pee.",
        "Hey, how come, uhh, Chandler didn't come?",
        "Right, I go-, I got it.",
        "Yeah. Uh, oh, OH, the best part, c'mon. [leads them to the bathroom, gestures towards toilet, everyone stares, uncomprehending] Heh?",
        "No no no, behind it.",
        "That's right, I have a phone in here.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hello.",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, that's OK. You uh, you had a thing.",
        "Ahh, forget about it, I'm havin' a ball. How's the apartment doin'",
        "Oh, well great.",
        "Well OK then. [oven timer goes off behind Chandler] Was that the oven timer?",
        "Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?",
        "Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Blepe.",
        "Hey, hey, they're runnin'",
        "I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.",
        "You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad.",
        "Hey.",
        "You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes?",
        "Likewise. Uh, I'll take that. [grabs moose hat] It's what I came for. So, this is new. Where'd you two meet?",
        "Wow.",
        "Oh, now it's a spare room?",
        "Well I uh, got what I came for. [puts on moose hat] I'll uh, I'll see you guys.",
        "Yeah, yeah he is. [leaves]",
        "Eddie.",
        "Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. [looks for the mail on the table by the door, it's not there] Where's the mail?",
        "You don't keep it over here on this table any more?",
        "Huh.",
        "No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me.",
        "So how you two gettin' along?",
        "Great, well, I'm happy for ya. [picks up the orange juice carton and it's empty] Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice. There's no juice f or the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice.",
        "Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man.",
        "Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?",
        "Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.",
        "[sings] It may not be a bed of roses.",
        "Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?",
        "What?",
        "Yeah, so.",
        "Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.",
        "Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?",
        "Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.",
        "Hey.",
        "Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch.",
        "Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?",
        "So where you gettin' it?",
        "Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?",
        "Can you believe this place?",
        "Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.",
        "Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.",
        "Huh?",
        "Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?",
        "Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.",
        "Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.",
        "Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.",
        "I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.",
        "What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.",
        "Well that's how I feel.",
        "Well then maybe I will.",
        "Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.",
        "Hey.",
        "Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened. . .",
        "I know. Yeah.",
        "No, we're alright.",
        "Plastic spoons. Great.",
        "These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.",
        "Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.",
        "I'm movin' out like we talked about.",
        "Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.",
        "Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.",
        "Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?",
        "Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.",
        "Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.",
        "Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?",
        "Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it.",
        "Yes! And the table is mine.",
        "Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?",
        "Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.",
        "Naa, you keep it, you need the practice.",
        "So, I guess this is it.",
        "Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again.",
        "Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care.",
        "Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed.",
        "Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.",
        "Page 42, page 42, page 42.",
        "Ooh, I look good.",
        "Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'",
        "Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?",
        "I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?",
        "They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son.",
        "No. No way, I'm not signing that.",
        "How can they do this to me?",
        "I don't feel like talkin.",
        "Hey.",
        "I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out.",
        "Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin.",
        "Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.",
        "No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.",
        "No, that means nothin to me.",
        "Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?",
        "Freaky.",
        "Monica, relax, go get a beer.",
        "Who said it was for you?",
        "You're kiddin'.",
        "Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.",
        "Do what?",
        "See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?",
        "Yeah good luck, good luck.",
        "Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich?",
        "Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo.",
        "Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?",
        "Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.",
        "Hey, hey, hey no.",
        "Well if he's not gonna eat it, I will.",
        "Phoebs, he's just a little dog. [turns back to the car window and the dog is halfway through it.] Ahhh.",
        "Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.",
        "Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?",
        "Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.",
        "Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'",
        "Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.",
        "How come those?",
        "That is so not my motto.",
        "Good.",
        "Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it.",
        "[dials the phone] It's a woman.",
        "[in a fake voice] Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye. [hangs up]",
        "[in the voice] Hard to say.",
        "[walks out of his room] Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.",
        "Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?",
        "By someone besides Monica?",
        "He-he-he, how's it goin'?",
        "Excellent.",
        "Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?",
        "Oh no, what happened?",
        "Yeah, I've had it.",
        "But don't you need experience for a job like that?",
        "Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.",
        "Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.",
        "Ha-ha. [Scott leaves] Are all you processors dorks?",
        "Hey.",
        "Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.",
        "Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.",
        "Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?",
        "I figure my character has kids.",
        "Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.",
        "Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.",
        "You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.",
        "Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.",
        "What a phony.",
        "Sir.",
        "Yeah Bing, what's that about?",
        "This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.",
        "Joseph's good, isn't he?",
        "Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.",
        "Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.",
        "Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.",
        "'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.",
        "Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.",
        "What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.",
        "Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.",
        "Karen.",
        "Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.",
        "Really?",
        "Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.",
        "It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot. [Chadler pushes him out the door by the face.]",
        "Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?",
        "Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.",
        "Cause she uh, she steals stuff.",
        "Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.",
        "I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.",
        "Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals.",
        "Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.",
        "Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.",
        "[peeks back out] Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, [sees that the coast is clear] oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.",
        "Right this is staging.",
        "[as they're walking out, Dr. Greene questioningly gestures at the Happy Birthday sign over the door] This is clearly in the wrong apartment. [they all walk across the hall]",
        "Quick volleyball question.",
        "Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?",
        "Ahh, you drive safe.",
        "Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. [grabs her and kisses her to distract her. She goes limp in his arms. Mr. Greene leaves.] Well, ok, you take care.",
        "Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.",
        "Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over.",
        "Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.",
        "No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.",
        "Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?",
        "I don't know.",
        "How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?",
        "[Monica walks back in the kitchen] Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What's the matter with you, he's parking the car.",
        "Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. [With money in his palm] Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats [shakes his had and passes the dollar].",
        "No problem. Hey Chandler",
        "Ok.",
        "He-he-eyy. [Shakes his had and passes the dollar]",
        "Ok. He kept my dollar.",
        "How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?",
        "Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.",
        "Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks.",
        "Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.",
        "We're the guys.",
        "Man you are incredible.",
        "Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with.",
        "No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads. [Chandler starts kicking him below the table] I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here.",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "Nooooo.",
        "Not a dad.",
        "Hey.",
        "Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?",
        "Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.",
        "Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache.",
        "Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee.",
        "Anybody want a croan.",
        "So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?",
        "No, can we get back to me?",
        "Alright. Cab driver number two?",
        "But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?",
        "But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.",
        "I'm sorry. See ya.",
        "What is it?",
        "See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.",
        "It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Look at this, how did I spend so much money?",
        "Ahh.",
        "My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do.",
        "What?",
        "That's a two line part.",
        "So what.",
        "Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.",
        "Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'",
        "Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.",
        "Look, I don't wanna hear this right now.",
        "Well don't just say.",
        "Ok.",
        "I don't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray. That was huge. Big things are gonna happen, you'll see. Ross, you still there?",
        "Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go.",
        "Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show.",
        "I fell down an elevator shaft.",
        "What?",
        "All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks.",
        "What?",
        "Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything. ",
        "And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.",
        "No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day. [gets up and leaves]",
        "Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose.",
        "They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.",
        "Thanks Ross.",
        "I went.",
        "I didn't get it.",
        "What?",
        "Huh?",
        "[movers removing a glass parrot] Oh, not my parrot.",
        "I can't watch this.",
        "Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register.",
        "Thanks Ross. I really like that bird though...I'll take the dog though.",
        "Hello.",
        "I know I would.",
        "Hey no problem.",
        "Na, na I'm ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is...",
        "A little foos?",
        "What happened to the foosball?",
        "He paid a lot of money for it.",
        "Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky.",
        "Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.",
        "All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.",
        "Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.",
        "No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.",
        "I did do it, I'm a professional.",
        "See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother. ",
        "Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.",
        "Come on, I need your help here.",
        "You see this, this is a friend.",
        "Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?",
        "Yeah, that makes sense. (looks at Ross)",
        "Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much. (Chandler ignores him) Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone.",
        "Aww, Rach, I think you look cute (kisses her on the cheek, then looks at Ross) And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon (goes to kiss him).",
        "Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him (runs out)",
        "(entering) Man, I got this close to him (holds up his fingers) and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on?",
        "Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.",
        "Aw, man I'm sorry (starts rubbing Chandler's shoulder). This must be very tough for ya, huh (and starts comfroting him looking for a kiss).",
        "Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....Hello? Hello? (picks up a statue of an Indian and walks into\nhis room)",
        "Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.\nEND",
        "I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.",
        "Morning, hey, you made pancakes?",
        "(sarcastically) Good morning.",
        "(under his breath) Kiss her! Kiss her!",
        "B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.",
        "Come on, quite yankin' me.",
        "This is Janice.",
        "Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.",
        "(entering) Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.",
        "Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?",
        "There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?",
        "Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?",
        "Wheel!",
        "Fortune! This guy is so stupid. (yelling) It's Count Rushmore!!",
        "I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?",
        "Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.",
        "No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. (walks into the kitchen, Chandler follows closely, he turns around and gets startled). Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair (holds his hands up to signify she has big hair)?",
        "Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.",
        "Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?",
        "Look, what do you want me to say?",
        "I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna (grimaces and tenses up) pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.",
        "Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain? (Chandler gives him a look like 'You stupid idiot!')",
        "I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.",
        "And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...",
        "But what does that gonna do...",
        "Okay. I'm in.",
        "Does it have to be a whole day?",
        "Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy.",
        "I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.",
        "But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.",
        "No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.",
        "Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.",
        "Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.",
        "Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having s*x.",
        "You guys, can we please not watch this all right.",
        "(on tv) Oh, you said it Mike. (rips open the carton and spills\n      milk on the counter) Aw! There's got to be a better way!",
        "Can we please turn this off?",
        "(on TV, finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is\n      easy. (starts to poor the milk) Now, I can have milk everyday.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't\n      show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first\n      good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the\n      message?!",
        "How is it you?",
        "Yep, that's my audition.",
        "Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her\n      that I missed my chance.",
        "Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to\n      friends, she only talks to agents.",
        "What, what are you doing? What are you doing?",
        "Hang up, hang up. (reaches with his good arm, but Phoebe grabs\n      it and he tries to reach the phone with his other arm but can't\n      because of the sling.)",
        "I love that movie. (Joey is using it as a pillow)",
        "I'm sorry, it just felt nice.",
        "Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing\n      stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.",
        "Hey, you know about that?!",
        "Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I\n      understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than\n      one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much\n      like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of\n      heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of\n      bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of\n      commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed\n      guy there ever was.",
        "Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the\n      barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!",
        "Come on baby, come on!",
        "Thank you so much.",
        "You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see\n      there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and\n      Estelle couldn't get me in.",
        "Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's\n      two.",
        "Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at\n      it. I love you.",
        "Nooo, four.",
        "(entering) G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?",
        "Pheebs! There you are!",
        "But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe! (catches her in the\n      hallway)",
        "Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything?\n      I think I got a shot at it.",
        "It's okay, these things happen.",
        "I'm, I'm okay. See. (tries to smile, but fails horribly)",
        "No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had!\n      Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it\n      personally.",
        "They actually said that?",
        "No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents\n      always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went\n      another way', but this, I can use this. (in a very bad Italian\n      accent) I canna work on a new accent.",
        "Okay, shoot.",
        "I didn't get it?",
        "Okay, what else?",
        "Oh.",
        "Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really\n      appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to\n      Estelle.",
        "Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she\n      is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb\n      brains out.",
        "You do, thanks.",
        "Wait a minute.",
        "Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get\n      out of being my agent.",
        "(in a really, really bad Italian accent) That's-ah what I\n      suspected-ah.",
        "Well, that’s really a different question.",
        "Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.",
        "Okay, but let’s say there was. How might that go?",
        "Hey, there’s a dog out there!",
        "Don’t you ah, don’t you wanna ask me any questions?",
        "Well, ah, I’m an actor. I’m fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don’t worry I’m totally okay with the gay thing.",
        "Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I’m totally cool with that.",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey! (goes into the apartment)",
        "Oh, no thanks, I got it. (picks it up) No I don’t!",
        "Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.",
        "That’s a uh, that’s a tough combination.",
        "Like you wouldn’t believe. (they go into the apartment) Wow! This is a great place.",
        "Gotcha.",
        "Oh, you bet I am!",
        "You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?",
        "Whoa, ah!! We’re you just gonna give me some lemonade?",
        "Oh right, right.",
        "Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I’m such a jerk.",
        "Baywatch.",
        "Lifeguards.",
        "Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.",
        "They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?",
        "No, no, no, don’t get up, I got a cooler right here.",
        "Cool!!",
        "Hey!",
        "No. Y'know how we’re always saying we need a place for the mail.",
        "Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.",
        "No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It’s a one day job, max.",
        "Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente’s.",
        "Power saw kinda got away from me there.",
        "Her what?",
        "Hey, Monica, who would yours be?",
        "It’s just a game Mon. (makes a ‘Can-you-believe-her’ face to the rest of the gang.) Rach, how about you?",
        "Hey-hey!",
        "I know.",
        "Oh, I’m sorry. Did I get ‘ya?",
        "Calm down, do you want this unit or not?",
        "Well, you should’ve told me that before, I’m not a mind reader. Hey, we’re out of beer. I’m going to Monica’s.",
        "Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.",
        "Nothing. It’s just old and dingy, that’s all.",
        "Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. (Monica gasps) Yeah.",
        "Relax. Here hold this (hands her his beer). This old stuff just comes right off. (he bends down to try and lift some tile right in the middle of the floor, in his tight pants.)",
        "(manages to pry off only a small piece) Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It’d take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it. (starts to walk away, but Monica grabs him)",
        "Eh! There you go.",
        "(yelling from bathroom) Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.",
        "Ooh, very official.",
        "Why don’t we just go on two.",
        "Because it’s faster.",
        "All right, but in the future...",
        "So we are going on two?",
        "Wow, it’s big!",
        "Maybe, my ruler’s wrong.",
        "Look it’s not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.",
        "Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.",
        "Y'know what?",
        "I bet ‘ya ya I could fit in there. (points to a hole in the center)",
        "Get out your checkbook, mister.",
        "You are dogged man! I totally fit!",
        "Thank you. Cha-ching! (Chandler starts to leave) Oh, well hello Mr. Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. (Chandler leaves and closes the door) And the drinks are on me!",
        "Question. Was ah, ‘Egg the Gellers!’ the war cry of your neighbourhood?",
        "Booo!!",
        "(entering) Hey, you guys!",
        "Guess what?",
        "I got a gig!",
        "Well, it’s not a part, no. I’m teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension.",
        "Yeah, yeah. It’s like my chance to give something back to the acting community.",
        "(glares at him) I know!",
        "Good evening. I’m Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as (proudly) Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, (looks for a reaction from his students, and gets none.) I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don’t have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this. (looks all intense for a moment and then gasps, the students cheer him) Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along.",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, ’Hey, the bell doesn’t dismiss you, I dismiss you.’",
        "Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children.",
        "Yeah, it’s this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I’m so, so right for it, y'know, he’s just like me. Except he’s a boxer, and has an evil twin.",
        "Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?",
        "You want me to lie to Chandler?",
        "No.",
        "Hey, you’re ah, pretty good at this.",
        "Ahh!",
        "Hey now!",
        "Hey!!! Oww!! And I’m bleeding.",
        "Okay, great.",
        "Okay.",
        "All right. I can’t see.",
        "Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I’ve never been able to cry as an actor, so if I’m in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let’s say I wanna convey that I’ve just done something evil. That would be the basic ‘I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it’ (Does it by raising one eyebrow, and showing off the pretend fishhook.) Okay, let’s say I’ve just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. (looks all confused) And that’s how it’s done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.",
        "Hey-hey.",
        "Awww, one of my students got an audition. I’m so proud.",
        "You bet! What’s the part?",
        "Wow! That was good. That was...(points to his pocket) Tweezers?",
        "Whoa. That was really good.",
        "Well, I-I might’ve said supergay.",
        "Because, Monica, the guy’s so good, and I really, really want this part.",
        "(sadly) There will come a time in each of your careers when you’ll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I’m ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he’s got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I’m stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. (he gets a huge round of applause from his students.) Thank you.",
        "All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.",
        "Oh-ho-kay, I’m talking to the king. (starts to go to a back room)",
        "And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.",
        "What? Me having a job?",
        "Well, I’m pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.",
        "Hey. What, what are you doing here?",
        "Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....",
        "Sure.",
        "All right.",
        "Oh, that’s, that’s ah, one of the old ones, he’s just taking it to the back.",
        "Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.",
        "Well, they go into the chipper.",
        "(to the guy operating the chipper) Hey! Hey!! (makes the ‘cut it’ motion with his hands)",
        "All right, I’ll take a box of the cream filled Jesus’s.",
        "Look Rach, wasn’t this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?",
        "If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you’ve got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.",
        "(entering, interrupting Rachel) Hey! I got great news!",
        "What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?",
        "Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?",
        "Not a problem.",
        "And now for the great news.",
        "Only if you think it’s better than this... (holds up an aerosol can) snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie.",
        "Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it’s a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.",
        "Yeah, the ah, trees that don’t fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.",
        "Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.",
        "(simulating an echo) Ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine...., eight, eight, eight... (Chandler hits him in the back of the head) Okay, Blast off!",
        "Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?",
        "Great, you can cover Chandler.",
        "Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.",
        "Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it’ll take your mind off Janice, and if you don’t play, everyone will be mad at you ‘cause the teams won’t be even. Come on.",
        "Says who? Your mom?",
        "All right, we have to pick captains.",
        "What?",
        "Thank you.",
        "(to his team) All right, huddle up, right over here.",

        "Her name is Dutch, and also Marklan.",
        "Mar-klan.",
        "Yeah! Why don’t you stick around. You can sit right there.",
        "I think so.",
        "Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.",
        "Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I’ll let you have her.",
        "Well I don’t like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don’t feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You’re better with numbers and stuff.",
        "Fumble!",
        "What the hell’s the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.",
        "All right, that’s it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.",
        "Pheebs, run!",
        "After!!",
        "It’s hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.",
        "What are you gonna do?",
        "Okay.",
        "Here you go!",
        "Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it’s better if we’re on the same team.",
        "Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.",
        "Nice try. (to Margha) See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.",
        "Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I’m not playing with this guy, now.",
        "What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?",
        "Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn’t understand the question.",
        "Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of s*x.",
        "This sucks, I was just up by that much!",
        "(looking at the timer) Thirty seconds left on the timer!",
        "When they’re hungry enough, they’ll come in.",
        "(entering with Monica) Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?",
        "Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way\n      would be, to not.",
        "It’ll kill him. I mean it’ll, it’ll just kill him.",
        "(looking out the window) Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his\n      new hammock. It’s like a Play-Doo Fat Factory. ",

        "Oh God. Uh, okay, here’s the thing, this is the thing, okay, the\n      thing is...",
        "Okay. I went down to the ‘Mattress King’ showroom and,\n      and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.",
        "They were in his office.",
        "I’m telling you man, I saw it.",
        "I’m not wrong! I wish I was. I’m sorry. Bet that barium enema\n      doesn’t sound so bad now, huh?",
        "You said number two.",
        "I know. (giggles harder)",
        "Uh.",
        "Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still. (Phoebe runs to the\n      window and gasps.)",
        "I’m tellin’ ya, he hasn’t moved since this morning.",

        "Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no\n      reason we get when we get Chinese food?",
        "Well, now we got a reason.",

        "Hey uh, what’s a matter?",
        "Oh my God, is she going back to him?",
        "What are you ah, what are you gonna do?",
        "Well, it doesn’t matter what I would do.",
        "All right, you’re probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if\n      it was me, and this is just me, (Chandler gets ready to throw\n      another dart) I would ah, I would bow out.",
        "They have a kid together, y'know. They’re like, they’re like a\n      family, and if, I don’t know, there’s chance they could make that\n      work, I know I wouldn’t want to be the guy who stood in the way\n      of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?",
        "All right now remember, something this big and long is going to\n      be difficult to manouver, fortunately I have a lot of experience\n      in that area.",
        "All right, ladies and gentlemen, let’s poke. (they start to\n      advance the giant poking device) Steady. Steady. Okay, a little\n      higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, we’re approaching the\n      window (as he says this the camera cuts to their view of Ugly\n      Naked Guy, so that we actually see him!) Thread the needle.\n      Thread the needle. ",
        "Okay, retract the device, retract the device.",

        "Okay, pick a card, any card. (Monica picks one) All right, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it?",
        "All right, give it back to me. (takes the card back, but he looks at the card before he puts it back in the deck, he holds the deck to his forehead, and thinks a little while) 5 of hearts.",
        "I can’t tell you that, no.",
        "All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I’ll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn’t see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. (picks up a card and quickly looks at it) I just did it. (does it again) I just did it, again. Here, I’ll slow it down so that you guys can see it. (looks and the card in slow motion)",
        "Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.",
        "Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....",
        "I don’t know, Chandler is supposed to be passin’ ‘em around...",

        "No, only for s*x.",
        "Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!",
        "(angrily entering, to Chandler) Can I talk to you for a second?!",
        "Come on!! (motions for Chandler to come with him)",
        "I just got off the phone with my sister.",
        "Mary-Angela.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Why don’t you ask Chandler, ‘cause he’s the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin’ over Janice by groping my sister.",
        "Really? That’s great! You and my sister, sittin’ in a tree.",
        "Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?",
        "You are so the man! (motions him to come in, and he does) Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, ‘cause my Grandma doesn’t know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.",
        "She’s right in there. (motions to the living room)",
        "What’s goin’ on?",
        "What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?",
        "Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you’d be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!",
        "No! No! No! No, I’m not going to punch Chandler.",
        "No you won’t. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he’s sorry. But, (to Chandler) you’ve got one more apology to make, all right, you’ve got to apologize to Mary-Angela.",
        "All right.",
        "Cookie, now you can punch him!",
        "All right, that’s it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. (gets up) This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! (stops and turns around and asks Rachel) But, is he a big guy?",
        "(hanging up the phone) Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?",
        "It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.",
        "What?",
        "Who?",
        "The what?",
        "Oh, okay. (to Ross) The what?",
        "(singing) You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, (picks a handkerchief from the pianist's pocket) you've got to pick a pocket or two..........",
        "Really? Thanks.",
        "Excellent, I'll be there.",
        "Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part.",
        "Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either.",
        "Yeah, I can dance, y'know. (starts to dance really, really, really badly)",
        "Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing.",
        "Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.",
        "Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?",
        "(reading) The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...",
        "Whoa, I'm not done.",
        "Done.",
        "Mark's a genius!",
        "And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, (sadly) 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'",
        "So, does that mean the audition is off?",
        "What?!",
        "It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.",
        "Bye. (does the jazz hands)",
        "I know, it was the best I could get out of them.",
        "People, people, people.",
        "(to Phoebe) Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?",
        "Cool.",
        "Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you’ll probably be hungry after the s*x.",
        "Hey.",
        "Check the freezer. If there’s none in there, then we’re probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It’s late.",
        "I discovered I’m able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.",
        "Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.",
        "Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we’ve got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.",
        "Haven’t you ever read the same book over and over again?",
        "The question should be Rach, what is not so great about The Shining. Okay? And the answer would be: nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it’s way better than that classic of yours.",
        "All right, you got it.",
        "Okay.",
        "Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.",
        "How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?",
        "These little women. Wow!",
        "Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo’s manuscript. I don’t see how he could ever forgive her.",
        "But Jo’s got a crush on Laurie. (Ross nods his head) Oh. You mean it’s like a girl-girl thing? ‘Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.",
        "No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.",
        "(noticing Chandler) What are you doing? (he pushes Chandler back to his side of the couch) Get back over on your side of the... (sees Robert in all his glory) Hello!! (to Robert) Hi, I’m Joey, we haven’t met.",
        "Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?",
        "Hey! (starts to laugh.) How’s it going?",
        "Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?",
        "Oooh, the next part’s the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...",
        "All right I’ll talk in code. (to Ross and Chandler) Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?",
        "Oh, all blank, and no blank, make’s blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!",
        "Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.",
        "Beth, Beth dies?",
        "Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?",
        "Then why would you say that?!",
        "Beth is really, really sick.",
        "Jo’s there, but I don’t think there’s anything she could do.",
        "Yeah.",
        "(nodding his head) Okay.",
        "Wow! This girl is good.",
        "(to Leslie) So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.",
        "(to Leslie) Ah, anything we might of heard of?",
        "(joining in) Home is Home Star stew.",
        "(to Phoebe) Wow, that was kinda brutal.",
        "Ah, he can’t make it, he said he had to his... (sees Ginger) Whoa-oh! (hides behind the coat rack.)",
        "Phew, close one.",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "Is ah, is Chandler around?",
        "Oooh.",
        "Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn’t something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?",
        "Aww, man. That’s the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he’s my roommate, she’s gonna tell him what I did.",
        "What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can’t, I can’t tell you that, it’s like the most awful, horrible thing I’ve ever done my whole life.",
        "All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad’s cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....",
        "I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.",
        "I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should’ve told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.",
        "I ran!!",
        "(entering from his bedroom) Morning.",
        "(to Chandler) Heard about the leg burnin’ huh?",
        "Listen, I ah, I know it’s a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?",
        "Yeah. You okay?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Where have you been?",
        "(to Monica) Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?",
        "Done.",
        "So Pheebs what’s this guy like?",
        "Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?",
        "Yeah!",
        "Uh, y'know what, we’re having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we’ll need a little more time to think about it.",
        "Both of us? (points to Chandler and himself)",
        "We’ll be there.",
        "Uh, 10:30.",
        "4:30.",
        "Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?",
        "She was kidding about that right?",
        "God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?",
        "Dude, I don’t know.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don’t want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don’t want to be seeing.",
        "Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... (clears throat) y'know each would, (clears throat again) y'know (pause) be?",
        "Yeah, I guess, but what’s like heads and what’s tails?",
        "So what are you gonna do?",
        "Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.",
        "Nothing, he’s just really believes in that.",
        "(Voice Over) Previously on Friends.",
        "Yeah. We figured when we couldn’t find you, you’d gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?",
        "Look, Ross look, I’m on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that’s gonna get you in trouble.",
        "Yeah, and there won’t be a relationship left to rebuild.",
        "All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn’t find out some other way. (spins the chair around so that Ross is facing him) Did you think about the trail?",
        "(stomps on the footrest which pops Ross up into a sitting position) The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! (slapping his hands with each word) You always have to think about the trail!",
        "Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that’s all. I mean, come on, it’s just a little wax.",
        "Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?",
        "Don’t answer that.",
        "Awful! Horrible!",
        "She was nothing compared to you.",
        "Ewwwww!",
        "Y'know what, I don’t think we should listen to this anymore. (Goes to open the door)",
        "Why not?! (to Chandler) I’m hungry.",
        "Yeah, we’ll be fine.",
        "Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. (makes like he is trying to send a telepathic message to Rachel) Put olives on the pizza.",
        "You think I need a new walk?",
        "Well y'know, I’ve been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a ‘take notice’ walk.",
        "Whoa-ho-ho! (He looks at Chandler, who gives him a ‘come on’ look.) Yeah, okay.",
        "Maybe she killed him?",
        "(whispering) No, I really have to pee.",
        "Can I see the comics?",
        "Okay, may I see the comics?",
        "Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.",
        "Well Ross was hangin’ out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....",
        "Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.",
        "Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.",
        "I had the same dream!",
        "Oh, I had the opposite dream.",
        "Yeah, I mean it’s never taken me a week to get over a relationship.",
        "Rach, it’s, it’s ah, it’s not that we don’t want to, really. (quietly) Are we talking models in their underwear?",
        "(He turns around to Chandler looking for approval to go with Rachel, Chandler mouths ‘Come on!’) (turning back to Rachel) Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "You’re smoking again?!",

        "It’ll be great for next weekend.",
        "It’ll be great for next weekend. I mean, (in an Irish accent) it’ll be grrreat.",
        "Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother’s cab, but y'know what, I’ll stay.",
        "(to Chandler and Monica) Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?",

        "Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!",
        "Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?",
        "Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.",
        "If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.",
        "Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.",
        "(opening the door) And there you go!",
        "Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.",
        "Okay, done.",
        "That’s ‘help’ spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!",
        "Hey!!",
        "Arrrghh!!",
        "Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?",
        "No, I wasn’t gonna ask you that, no.",
        "I-I can’t handle this, you guys.",
        "(pause) What?",
        "(pause) What?",
        "Yeah, and not put us in the middle.",
        "Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who’s going with who?",
        "Come on man, you drove all the way up here.",
        "Yeah! Oh my God! (to Chandler) Is this what it’s like to be you?",
        "Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we’re on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it’s like somebody’s ripping out my heart!",
        "Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?",
        "Hey, Kate!",
        "Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week...",
        "(to himself) And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah...",
        "Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani.",

        "All right.",
        "Come on baby, don’t go. Please? What do you say?",
        "(to Kate) That guy’s like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?",
        "Hey, I’m not interested in her sweater! It’s what’s underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I’m going out with?",
        "Do you want me to want you to care?",
        "What?",
        "Come on baby, don’t go. Please? What do you say?",
        "Hey, it’s gonna be all right.",

        "(to Kate) Ah, are you okay?",
        "I don’t know.",
        "How do you mean?",
        "Maybe he could slip her the tongue.",
        "Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.",
        "And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!",
        "Something like that?",
        "Yeah.",
        "(to Ross) Hey.",
        "(to Monica) Hey.",
        "Hey.",
        "No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.",

        "Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming ‘cause, ‘cause her eyes keep going like this. (He closes his eyes and moves them around, kinda like he’s been processed by the devil, or something.)",
        "Hey.",
        "So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall?",
        "Y'know, about what happened with us.",
        "What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can’t tell me last night didn’t mean something to you. I-I was there, you’re not that good an actress.",
        "Nooo.",
        "Hi, Lauren.",
        "(on phone) Well, so anyway Beth, what I’m saying is I should’ve considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I’ve ah, I’ve recently learned what’s it like to be on your side of it, and I’m sorry. So, do you think you can forgive me? (listens) Great. Thanks. Okay, bye.

(listens) Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.",
        "Oh, nothing, no. It’s an acting exercise, I’m practising my fake laugh.",
        "What-what’s so funny?",
        "Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.",
        "Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.",
        "Well, have-have you told him how you feel?",
        "No-no-no-no-no. (They start to turn away, but Phoebe stops them, and turns them back to face her.)",
        "No.",
        "So, we’re walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, “Hey, let’s go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,” remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, “Nah, let’s just hang out at your place.” Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.",

        "Yeah, that was real.",
        "I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can’t do it, they’re all like-like laughing at me.",

        "Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?",
        "Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and nothin’. You look at me, and it’s nothin’. (He kisses her) Nothing.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it’s says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don’t know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you’re a bitch.",

        "God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, ‘Oh, I’m so talented.’ and ‘Oh, I’m so pretty,’ and ‘Ooh, I smell so good.’",
        "Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?",
        "Oh. (realises) Ohh. Ohh, you’re out of your mind.",
        "Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!",

        "Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.",
        "Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy’s\n      theory. Okay?",
        "Saw a girl with that vest.",

        "Hey.",
        "How’s she doing?",
        "Well yeah, don’t-don’t you think it’s a she?",

        "That’s not what I said. Okay, I just meant...",
        "I don’t know, maybe we weren’t ready to have a chick.",
        "Do you think we’ll get our three bucks back?",
        "Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks\n      great in the blue one.",
        "(entering) Hey!",

        "Yeah, maybe it’s like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns. (pats Ross on the butt)",
        "Yeah. What are we getting?",
        "Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. (thinking aloud) Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?",
        "(sticking his head out the window) Hey, the fight’s starting!",
        "(sticking his head out the window) Fight’s over!",
        "Check it out, he’s winning! (to Monica) Pete’s winning!",

        "Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.",
        "Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.",
        "Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.",

        "Kate, do you even like me?",
        "Well so, how come you blew me off? Y'know? How come you were with him?",
        "Thanks.",
        "(Checks to see if she’s drooling on his shirt.) Okay. Okay, okay, hey. (Lays her down and covers her with a blanket.) There we go, let’s get your feet up there. (Looks at her) Good night, Kate. Sweet dreams. (Picks up a garbage can) I’m gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.",
        "(entering, happily) Hey!",
        "Yeah! I stayed at Kate’s, but ah, nothing happened. Hey, Pheebs, where were ya?",
        "Oh, it was great! Yeah, I-I walked her home, and it was amazing how much we connected, y'know? Then ah, then she passed out, but then she woke up. Yeah? And we stayed up all night talking, and now we’re like totally crazy about each other!",

        "Well, so, stay for the museums!",
        "Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? I mean, I’ll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.",
        "(to Lauren) In a minute!!",
        "Yeah, I guess it is. (sees Kate is watching, he turns Lauren so that he can talk directly to Kate, but still look like he is talking to Lauren) Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick ‘cause this is killing me. One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you’ve got things you have to do now, and so do I. And so… I’m gonna get on this spaceship, (smoke starts pouring in from the ceiling, and a ladder comes down, with flashing, colored lights on the side of it) and I’m gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you’ll be long gone. But I won’t have aged at all. (gets on the ladder) So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I’m gonna want to meet her.",
        "Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about\n      geography.",
        "Well, I think we all learned something.",

        "Look, we’re not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!",
        "All right. But, you’re gonna have to tell them. (He opens the cabinet to reveal the chick and the duck living inside with Christmas lights and a disco ball as decorations.)",
        "Looks good, uh?",
        "Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!",
        "What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.",

        "What? What’s wrong?",
        "(to Chandler) Dude, Phoebe’s mom has got a huge peni...",
        "Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don’t think any of them are gonna work out.",
        "Pretty nice?",
        "(to Peter) Good for you!!",
        "(looking at the flyer) Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!",
        "Uh, Pheebs, about your mom...",
        "(pause) How’s that going?",
        "That’s so sweet. (pause) I’m gonna get some coffee. (gets up and leaves)",
        "This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.",
        "Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn’t, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny ‘til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.",
        "Oh yeah? (opens up the center and takes out the stereo) If I can’t, I’ll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.",
        "Okay. (he gets in the unit and closes the door) See?! I told ya! ",
        "Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!",
        "(still trapped in the entertainment center) WHAT?!! ",
        "Yeah...",
        "(getting out) Awww, man! He promised he wouldn’t take the chairs!!",
        "Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn’t think big enough to fit a grown man!",
        "I was tryin’ to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I’m gonna do?",
        "(looking through a deck of cards) Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is!",
        "Dude, you don’t have to brag! We got nothing here!!",
        "Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?",
        "I’m gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.",
        "All right that’s it, school is in session! (Exits and slams the door.)",
        "Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you’re gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.",
        "Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.",
        "I have actually not heard of that.",
        "Why don’t you tell me something I don’t know! (He storms out, and once Treeger closes the door behind him, Joey makes an ‘Oops!’ have.)",
        "Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he’d better come up here and apologize. I’ll see you later. (Starts to leave)",
        "He said that he wasn’t gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he’s gonna do is have you evicted—I’ll see you later.",
        "Well he made Rachel cry!",
        "All right! I’ll try! But if I can’t, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.",
        "All right, all right, all right. (Starts to leave, stops, and turns around) I mean I’ll have to check with him first, but I’ll think he’ll be cool with it. (Monica shoos him out.)",
        "Please don’t kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn’t there fault, it was mine.",
        "No you can’t do that, where would the chick and the duck live?",
        "Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I’m the chick and Chandler is the duck.",
        "Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I’ll do whatever you want.",
        "Yeah-yeah, absolutely.",
        "What, what is it?",
        "That’s not, prison lingo, is it?",
        "Yeah, there’s this superintendent’s dance, the Super Ball. I don’t know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he’s a crush on.",
        "Well, he’s too shy, he doesn’t thing he’s good enough to dance with girls yet.",
        "Aww, man, now we won’t be bank buddies!",
        "Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I’m doing something exciting and I don’t wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y’know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!",
        "No-no, thank you.",
        "All right, I’m here, let’s ahh, get this over with.",
        "Whoa-whoa, don’t we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like ahh, get really drunk?",
        "No, it’s okay, but if I’m Marge, my breasts are coming out my back.",
        "Come on man, you’re not a potato.",
        "Come on Treeger, don’t say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, let’s ahh, let’s try it again. Come on. (they start dancing again) Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y’know, I’m not really that comfortable dancing with a—(Treeger throws him) We-he!! Hey!",
        "Ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time. (He walks into the kitchen and does a little dance step on the way.)",
        "What?",
        "No I didn’t.",
        "No, I’m not! And it wasn’t a hop it was a pademarie.",
        "All right, well maybe I’m enjoying it a little bit. I mean I’m getting pretty good at it.",
        "Hey-hey, hold on, this isn’t some kind of like girly dance. All right, it’s like a sport, it’s manly!",
        "All right.",
        "I don’t know how to lead.",
        "What?!",
        "(To Mr. Treeger) So you ah, ready for our last practice?",
        "Look, you wanna use our place?",
        "We did it!!",
        "I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.",
        "Oh well, okay, good luck.",
        "Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?",
        "Okay.",
        "Go get ‘em Treeger.",
        "(intrigued) Really?",
        "No, I’m good.",
        "Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there. (Goes back into the hall)",
        "(Returning carrying a couple of rusted lawn chairs) Huh?!",
        "Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!",
        "Just pickle.",
        "Yeah-eh-eah! (Rachel glares at him) Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant.",
        "Uhhhh. (He’s not sure)",
        "No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.",
        "Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.",
        "He cut off his ear.",
        "I’m out.",
        "Wow! That’s pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear ‘cause he sucked. What else you got in there?",
        "In the woods. No wait-wait, that’s the joke answer.",
        "Spock’s birth control.",
        "Wow! There’s a lot I didn’t know about vomit. (The duck comes to the door of the bathroom, quacking.) (To the duck) In a minute. (The duck goes back into the bathroom.)",
        "Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I’m home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there’s a few things you don’t get from book learnin’.",
        "How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?",
        "You wanna see what I got? (He gets up to empty out his pockets) Okay? I’ve got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!",
        "And a 50. (The salesman stops suddenly) Huh, these must be Chandler’s pants.",
        "Oh, I-I think I’m gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out.",
        "Wh-what’s going on?",
        "No he doesn’t!",
        "Well, it’s good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.",
        "Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.",
        "Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.",
        "Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?",
        "(lying on a beach towel, recapping what happened in the last episode) Okay, so we went to the beach, because Phoebe found out about this lady who knew her mom and dad, and I don’t really know what happened with that.",
        "(voice-over) Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldn’t go out with a guy like Chandler...",
        "(voice-over) ...and he couldn’t let it go, and... I don’t really know what happened with that either. ",
        "(voice-over) Oh-oh! And then Ross’s new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up and Rachel convinced her to save her head. And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I don’t know what happened there either... ",
        "Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler. (gets up and leaves.)",
        "Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don’t you wanna stay here and talk about it?",
        "(jumping up in a hole that he is digging, he is shoulder deep) Hey, you guys! Take a look at this! (Chandler and Monica jump up and go over to the hole.) Check this baby out, dug me a hole!",
        "Oh no! No!! My hole!!",
        "(climbing out of the hole) What?! What?!! What is it?!",
        "Yeah, and I’m a little tired from digging the hole.",
        "Well, there’s really only one thing you can do.",
        "You’re gonna have to pee on it.",
        "Don’t blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.",
        "If you want some privacy you can use my hole.",
        "Me too.",
        "No?",
        "Sure, it’s hard to forget! But that doesn’t mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, (to Chandler) ever talk about.",
        "It’s between us and the sea, Ross!",
        "Nope.",
        "NO!!!",
        "All right. (gets up) ",
        "Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It’s eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.",
        "And I was tired from digging the huge hole!",
        "I’d seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...",
        "That’s right I stepped up! She’s my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I’d pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn’t. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.",
        "(laughs) That’s ‘cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.",
        "Hey!",
        "Why?",
        "You can pee here!",
        "We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?",
        "Oh, I know...",
        "(entering the apartment) Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.",
        "It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?",
        "Why not?",
        "Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... \"Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!\"",
        "She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.",
        "(whining and heading toward the door) Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...",
        "Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?",
        "Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.",
        "So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?",
        "All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.",
        "What kind of smell?",
        "All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?",
        "You wanna see her again, right?",
        "So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah!",
        "All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! (Ross hesitates, looks unsure) Oink!",
        "(entering) Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!",
        "Our place, the hall! I...",
        "(Unimpressed) A book? (Suddenly interested) Is it like a book that's also a safe?",
        "You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. (Joey leaves, comes back in.) Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?",
        "Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.",
        "Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!",
        "Hey!",
        "You know, uh... [Joey moves the pen case out onto the counter.] Chandler got you a gift, too.",
        "Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!",
        "Ah. Hm. (To Kathy) Wanna go to bed?",
        "Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. (Tries to strike a sexy pose up against the doorway to his room. Then goes inside).",
        "(opening bedroom door) Hey, that coupon expires, you know.",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?",
        "Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.",
        "Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Hey guys. (to Chandler) Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?",
        "It's 4:30.",
        "Okay, I see what's going on here.",
        "Yeah! You don't like Kathy.",
        "Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?",
        "Good, and hey! My treat. (He turns to go into his bedroom then stops.) But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?",
        "Is she great or what?",
        "(to Kathy) I'll be right back. (to Chandler) What was that?",
        "Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.",
        "I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.",
        "Well then, do it better!",
        "Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.",
        "(opening the door wearing nothing but a sock, and holding a dart board over the `Little General.') Hey! (Chandler turns down the TV) Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?",
        "(answering phone) Hello.",
        "(answering phone) Hello.",
        "(answering phone) Stop callin’!!",
        "All right!",
        "Hey!",
        "I’m sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.",
        "No! I’m putting that in my room.",
        "Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?",
        "Five years.",
        "Hey! Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time.",
        "No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don’t know why you’re pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there’s a spot open.",
        "Yeah!",
        "What?",
        "All right. But if you weren’t my best friend.",
        "(entering) Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?",
        "(Something in Italian.) (Storms out.)",
        "My folks.",
        "I don’t know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.",
        "Yeah, y’know at first I thought we could talk about this y’know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don’t think I…",
        "Look, it’s not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don’t want to live with some one who doesn’t know what it is to be a friend. So, I’ll see ya. (He starts to leave, but Chandler grabs his bag and stops him.)",
        "Yeah! You did! And that’s why I’m leaving.",
        "When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!",
        "Yeah! But if would’ve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn’t have worried about it so much! See you around!",
        "We’ve got a box. (Motions to a large wooden box next to him.)",
        "(coming out of the bathroom) What’s twisted?",
        "Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!",
        "He’s fine!",
        "Chandler?",
        "Hey!",
        "He’s doin’ some thinkin’!",
        "You kissed my girlfriend!",
        "That doesn’t sound like thinking to me!",
        "Y’know I don’t think you should be talking at all in there! I think you’ve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!",
        "All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn’t mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you’re just an idiot in a box!",
        "So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?",
        "That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? (There’s no response from Chandler.) Okay.",
        "I’ll get it. (It’s Kathy.)",
        "Hey.",
        "That’s okay. Chandler’s the one I’m mad at.",
        "In the box.",
        "(starting to cry) Open the box!! (Runs over to do so.)",
        "He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! (He opens the box) Get out of there!",
        "Yeah, we’re gonna be fine! Get out!",
        "Yeah, you did some real good thinkin’ in there.",
        "Now go! ‘Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you’re secret Santa! (Chandler runs out and closes the door.)",
        "All right, who got Chandler? ‘Cause I uh, need to trade.",
        "Uhh, that’s not them. I’m gonna go call the police.",
        "Great! All right, so I’ll call you later.",
        "That would be Casey. We’re going out tonight.",
        "No, things are fine with Kathy. I’m having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.",
        "Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself! (Laughs)",
        "Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?",
        "What is the big deal? It’s not like we’re exclusive.",
        "You got all that from the back of her head?",
        "Who’s Elaine?",
        "(on the other end at a pay phone) Hey, it’s me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.",
        "We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I’ll be there as soon as I can.",
        "‘Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to—(he stops talking suddenly)",
        "Yeah?",
        "Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more—(his time runs out for real)",
        "(on phone) Hey dude, it’s me.",
        "Listen uh, I’m really sorry, it looks like I’m gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn’t there!",
        "Yeah, it must’ve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.",
        "Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.",
        "Aww man! I can’t believe I locked myself out again! (He knocks on the door.)",
        "(rushing in) Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?",
        "Why?",
        "Well, you’re amazing.",
        "(very excited) A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That’s the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?",
        "Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.",
        "Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I’m gonna do that.",
        "No-no-no, I think I’m gonna see how things go with Kathy. She’s pretty cool.",
        "No-no, Kathy.",
        "No. No, Kathy.",
        "Y’know what I think? I think somebody’s got a little crush on Casey. How ‘bout I fix you two up? What do you think?",
        "Hey! Samboucha Margarita?",
        "Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.",
        "What’s up?",
        "You do?",
        "Well, you’re timing couldn’t be better. She’s not my girlfriend anymore.",
        "Yeah, she broke up with me.",
        "Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that’s why I let people watch.",
        "Well, I’ve been better. But, I’m all right. So you like her huh?",
        "No-no-no, no it’s uh, it’s okay.",
        "Yeah. You know why? ‘Cause you can to me first.",
        "But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you’re work cut out for you. ‘Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she’s into some other guy. So…",
        "Who?",
        "What?",
        "And what?! Did you sleep with her?!",
        "What?!! That’s even worse!!",
        "I don’t know! But it’s the same!",
        "Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!",
        "Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line, that you-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!",
        "Is that why you bought all this stuff?! (Chandler makes a face like \"Well, kinda.\") Well, y’know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there’s a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I’m not gonna eat! You know why?!",
        "Because it’s all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I’m not happy about you either. (The bread maker dings) Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you. (Joey walks into his bedroom and slams the door.)",
        "I think I know that girl.",
        "Oh yeah, I definitely know her.",
        "Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?",
        "Well, why do you call him Gandolf?",
        "No, I had s*x in high school.",
        "Will you calm down, he’s just a human guy.",
        "Really?!",
        "All right, I’ll see you guys.",
        "I have an audition, but I’ll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?",
        "Okay. (leaves as the phone rings)",
        "Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you’d be out partying with Gandel-worf.",
        "So you’ve been sittin’ around here all mornin’?",
        "So what if he didn’t come! We can still go out and party ourselves!",
        "Well, we could do that!",
        "We’ll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yeah!!",
        "Yeah! All right? Let’s go!",
        "All right, so we’ll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we’ll head back out.",
        "So, we’re having fun, right?",
        "We don’t need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we’ll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.",
        "Are you serious?!",
        "Thank God! I’m exhausted!",
        "Yeah, but uh, I don’t want to be up too late, so uh, I’ll have a decaf.",
        "I can’t hear a word you’re saying, my ears are ringing so bad.",
        "Yeah, I know.",
        "Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.",
        "We’re 29, we’re not women.",
        "Done! I did it! Heh, who’s stupid now? (He smiles and has cookie remains all over his teeth.)",
        "Well, I know what I’m giving you for Christmas.",
        "Ohhh!",
        "Hey, Mon! I’m not doing anything, why don’t you fire me?",
        "Good enough to get fired.",
        "Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?",
        "Yes!",
        "What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.",
        "Sure! Where are the seats?",
        "Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?",
        "Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!",
        "Oh, what are you gonna do? You’re gonna fire me?",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "(checks his watch) Damn! (runs out to work)",
        "(entering from the dining room) Hey.",
        "Hey, what happened to your fancy chef’s jacket? (sees there’s a burn spot on it)",
        "You got it! Oh-oh! (He starts patting the burned spot, which just happens to be over her breast.)",
        "It’s still a tiny bit on fire there.",
        "Yeah. Listen uh, I’d prefer it if you didn’t call me Joey. Since I don’t know anyone here, I thought it’d be cool to try out a cool work nickname.",
        "(opening an envelope) There’s like-there’s like 300 bucks in this one!",
        "No ma’am.",
        "I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, \"Wow! It’s been a long time since I had… (tries to do the math in his head, but can’t) 327 + 238 dollars!\"",
        "And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don’t fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they’ll start listening to all the nice things I’ve been saying about you.",
        "Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.",
        "(interrupting) Hey! Chef Geller! Y’know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!",
        "You bet I do! I just ah, wasn’t listening then, that’s all.",
        "What are you gonna do? You’re gonna fire me?",
        "Well I guess I should’ve thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!",
        "Yep! Looks like it’s gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.",
        "(leaving) Lean-lean-lean!",
        "Check it out! Check it out! Guess what job I got? [smoothes the blue blazer he's wearing and has a big grin on his face]",
        "Oh, tour guide at the Museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.",
        "No, not really. They give you all the information. It's like memorizing a script. [demonstrates] \"And on your left, you have Tyrannsoarus rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.\"",
        "Yeah, but I can pronounce \"Jurassic\".",
        "[disgustedly] You're really thinking of having s*x with your brother?",
        "Oh.",
        "Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.",
        "[gesturing to what I'm presuming is the Mastadon] Okay, now the Mastadon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.",
        "[looks nervous] Shhhh. This is a museum. No talking. [moves group along and gestures to a three legged foot] Okay, now right down here we have, uh... a large foot.",
        "Okay, moving right along. [moves group away] Come on.",
        "Oh, uh, would you mind sitting here? [gesturing across from him] I'm saving this seat for my friend Ross.",
        "Doctor? I didn't know he had a nickname.",
        "Well, uh, how come?",
        "That's crazy.",
        "I, I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables but Ross is one of my best friends. If I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it.",
        "Ross, Ross, over here man. [gestures beside him] I saved you a seat.",
        "It's no big deal you know. You do what you gotta do, right?",
        "[looks at him for a second and then gets up to throw his garbage away.] Whatever.",
        "Look, Ross, really, it's no big deal. You know, you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then, so be it. I understand. When I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right? So, you know, it's cool. I'll see you tomorrow. [leaves]",
        "[gets up, tray in hand, and walks to the middle table] I will sit with you Dr. Geller. [he puts his tray down on the table and Ross and Joey shake hands.]",
        "[stands up, whips coat off and throws it on the floor vehemently] I'm Joey. I'm an actor. I don't know squat about dinosaurs.",
        "You hang in there Ted!",
        "(entering) Hey! (Goes to the fridge.)",
        "(Holding a turkey leg) There’s gravy?",
        "I think I left a donut up here.",
        "Hey!",
        "(to Ross) That-that is a good trick.",
        "Chandler, look they’re actors. They’re there to do a job, just ‘cause they work together, doesn’t mean they’re gonna get together. I mean just ‘cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn’t mean it’s gonna happen with them.",
        "Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.",
        "Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?",
        "Well okay, so then you’re fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it’s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It’s when the heat goes away, that’s when you’re in trouble.",
        "Look, you guys have been to every play I’ve ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?",
        "Noooo!!",
        "Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?",
        "Yep! Grab a plate.",
        "No-no, stay right there. (Monica stops and Joey flips her a pancake, which flies over her head and lands in the living room.) Gettin’ closer.",
        "Listen also we’re uh, we’re watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.",
        "Oh yeah, who’s playing?",
        "All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!",
        "I don’t know, it smells good.",
        "(Holding a magazine) Wow! The new Playboy!",
        "Come here.",
        "Oh, yeah, totally! That’s such a turn-on!",
        "Oh-ooh, that’s the turn-on.",
        "Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, \"Hey, how you doin’?\"",
        "(to Phoebe) Hey, how you doin’?",
        "Well, you gotta give him something that he can’t say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you’re guaranteed he’ll say yes!",
        "Absolutely! And if it doesn’t, can I get the extra ticket?",
        "What the heck is that?",
        "No! Forget her, man! You don’t need her, you don’t need that!",
        "Dude, tell me she actually told you this.",
        "Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There’s a lot of theories that didn’t pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.",
        "Okay, for next time, what do you say?",
        "What’s ready?",
        "I don’t know, it looks the same.",
        "Oh yeah!",
        "How’d it go?",
        "It’s the chick! She’s…going through some changes.",
        "Good luck. (to Monica) And I’m still right!",
        "She’s mad because I know today’s her laundry day and that means she’s wearing her old lady underpants.",
        "Yeah, what’s that about?",
        "Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?",
        "Six.",
        "All right, we’ll start with…apples.",
        "Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt.",
        "Okay, the last thing…",
        "No-no, not for like another two weeks.",
        "Serious?",
        "No! All right, who-who makes up the questions?",
        "Huh.",
        "I know.",
        "Animals dressed as humans.",
        "(to Chandler) The Irish gig guy?!",
        "It’s All Relative.",
        "(to Chandler) Nana?",
        "(answering the question) Althea!",
        "I took a shot.",
        "Hey, no way, that rooster’s family!",
        "What do you have against the duck?! He doesn’t make any noise!",
        "Look, we are not gonna…",
        "(shocked) Dah!! (Chandler motions for him to calm down.)",
        "Oooooh!",
        "Okay.",
        "Big fat goalie.",
        "Weekend at Bernie’s.",
        "Everyday use.",
        "Guest.",
        "Uhh, 11!",
        "YEAH!!! YES!!!",
        "I call Monica’s room!",
        "Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, I’m sight of the room and I called it.",
        "What?",
        "Hey—ooh Pheebs, are they in there?",
        "Oh wow! You can tell this soon.",
        "What?!",
        "You can’t just ignore the bet! It’s a bet! You bet and you bet and if you lose, you lose the bet!",
        "Hey, don’t get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!",
        "But it is our apartment!",
        "Did you see the size of the closets?!",
        "Awwwww!! (They lean back all the way.) Awwwwwww!!!",
        "Guggly worm.",
        "Glow-pop giggly jammer.",
        "(examining it) Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year. (Monica drops the sandwich)",
        "(going over and picking up the rod) That’s all right. Hey you guys, you know what’s going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, \"Joey, what are you doing with your life?\" stuff. I can say, \"Well, I’m doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?\"",
        "Look, there’s nothing I can do for him right now, he’s still in his sweat pants, that’s still Phase One. Y'know? I’ll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.",
        "Gettin’ drunk and going to a strip club.",
        "Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.",
        "Yeah.",
        "(entering) Hey-hey!",
        "Oh my God, you guys have no idea.",
        "Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how’s he doing?",
        "(goes over to Chandler) Hey buddy! How’s it going?",
        "(To the rest of the gang) Hey, see that? He just needed his pal to come home. All right, uh, I’ve got to go memorise my lines. (Starts to go his bedroom) Me and Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning! Yeah-yeah!",
        "(running from his bedroom) Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!",
        "Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don’t have time! They’re just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.",
        "(rushing in) Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I’m here! I’m here!",
        "Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!",
        "(trying to act like he’s not the one that stinks.) Whoa! Yeah, what the hell is that? What smells so bad?",
        "Y’know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?",
        "No-no, it’s uh, it’s Heston.",
        "Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.",
        "Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?",
        "Interesting.",
        "How ya doin’?",
        "I guess you wouldn’t believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?",
        "No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I’m an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I’m doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.",
        "Yeah-yeah, I’m one of the cops that won’t work with you ‘cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I’m really sorry, but I stink!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh no-no-no, you don’t understand…",
        "Oh yeah, yeah.",
        "Yes sir! Yes sir, I’m-I’m—(he starts to leave)",
        "Yeah. Oh, yeah.",
        "I don’t wanna.",
        "I wanted to go to the strip club!",
        "Yeah, all right. (Ross enters.)",
        "Ohh, Nothing.",
        "I know what it did! Nothing.",
        "Like this. (Shrugs)",
        "Sure! It flushes it.",
        "Hey! (Sees Janice.) Ah!! (Janice screams in surprise.)",
        "And there it is.",
        "So what are you doing bringing her here?! There’s people here!",
        "Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. (They all look around and then back at Joey.) I’m tellin’ ya!",
        "Hey! What’s up?",
        "(to Rachel) I bet I stopped listening before you did.",
        "Dude, you’re not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.",
        "Hey-hey, what’s going on?",
        "Thanks for telling me!",
        "Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.",
        "Nope. (To Ross) Man look at this! Ross, I can’t believe you said you’d play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!",
        "(pointing to the TV) Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That’s called a scrum, okay? It’s kinda like a huddle.",
        "Ross! (Laughs) They’re gonna kill you!",
        "All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It’s not like he’s…Chandler!",
        "Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy (Points), and that guy (Points). And that one—Dude! They’re all huge!",
        "Well, maybe that’s because you’re closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.",
        "I totally don’t know what you’re talking about.",
        "No.",
        "Dude, if you go back out there, you’re gonna be Dead Ross!",
        "The Red Ross! Okay.",
        "Yeah, sure.",
        "Uhh, look, your eye’s still popping out a little, I’m gonna go get some ice.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Is it the shampoo? It’s guava.",
        "Oh! Wait-wait! (Reaches inside the shower.) Is it my bologna sandwich?",
        "Oh, wait-wait! (Reaches into the shower again.) Maybe it’s a pickle?!",
        "Hey, what have you guys been up too?",
        "Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.",
        "Hey that’s what all my relationships are like.",
        "Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.",
        "Yeah, what’ going on?",
        "Awwww!",
        "Surprise!!",
        "What-what-what is so funny?",
        "Now that’s a thinker.",
        "A little salami.",
        "Pastrami.",
        "Yeah. (He goes over to her.)",
        "Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.",
        "There was a seen in Footloose...",
        "Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl…",
        "What? Were you like in the movie, or… Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.",
        "Welcome to America. (They both kiss.)",
        "If you didn’t want to play, why did you come to the party?",
        "Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!",
        "All right look, y’know how-y’know how when you’re dating someone and you don’t want to cheat on them, unless it’s with someone really hot?",
        "All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you’re going to do something wrong, (He grabs two steaks from the freezer) do it right!",
        "Feel better now?",
        "Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.",
        "Well, I eat a lot of meat right?",
        "Well, suppose until the baby’s born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-you’d just be eating my animals.",
        "Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There’s no meat in beer, right?",
        "Okay, time to take off the bra. (She glares at him.)",
        "(trying not to be obvious) Take the bra off.",
        "Oooh, what you got there?",
        "Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y’know what goes good with that?",
        "Hm-mm, corn beef.",
        "Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that’s much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?",
        "(He starts looking longingly at the sandwich.) Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?",
        "Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?",
        "(coming in from his bedroom) What is that?",
        "Maybe he found you flip-flop.",
        "Whoa! Is this p0rn? What did I do? I must’ve hit something on the remote.",
        "No, we didn’t even pay our cable bill—maybe this is how they punish us.",
        "Maybe we shouldn’t pay our gas bill? (Stops and thinks about what he just said.)",
        "(to Chandler) Why would he turn off the TV? (Chandler shrugs.)",
        "Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!",
        "Imagine a protective p0rn bubble if you will, okay?",
        "Hey.",
        "Pheebs! You’re blocking the p0rn! Look out!",
        "Yeah right.",
        "Yeah, he likes p0rn.",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!",
        "You play hard to get.",
        "Then you go to Tokyo.",
        "Way to be strong, man!",
        "Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. ‘Cause you already told her you love her and she didn’t say it back, then she called you and told you that there’s another guy, so yeah, go to London that’ll scare her!",
        "Ross! Ross! If you’re going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars? (Chandler nods his head no.)",
        "(pause) Nothing. No, nothing.",
        "Hey.",
        "Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!",
        "Noo! Nothing!",
        "I think you’re right.",
        "One.",
        "That’s kinda nice.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah!!",
        "Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!",
        "Hey!",
        "Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?",
        "Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey’s your pal. Joey’s your buddy. \"Where is everybody?\" \"Well, they’re hanging out with Joey.\"",
        "Oh well, hey, Joey’s loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he’ll be there.",
        "What do ya say? What do ya say?",
        "I knew I shouldn’t have mentioned it! That’s what I wanted to name my kid!",
        "Hey!",
        "No, but I’m gonna!",
        "Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.",
        "Someone you didn’t make up!",
        "Yeah, that guy really hurt us.",
        "All right look man, I didn’t want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It’s not even a name; it’s barely even a word. Okay? It’s kinda like chandelier, but it’s not! All right? It’s a stupid, stupid non-name!",
        "I’m sorry man, I didn’t—I’m-I’m sorry. I’m sorry. (Goes over and comforts him.)",
        "So I guess it’s Joey then!",
        "(answering the door.) Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in. (He brings them inside.)",
        "Dude, I am sorry about what I said!",
        "It’s not that bad.",
        "So, you’re just Bing?",
        "No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.",
        "See you later, Gene.",
        "What’s up with Gene?",
        "Nah, you’re not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.",
        "Ohh! (Realises it was all a trick to get Phoebe to name the baby Chandler.)",
        "(joining in, in his sleep) Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!",
        "(proudly) Oh, you should here me.",
        "Look, I told ya, I’m not going to any clinic! I don’t have a problem, you’re the one with the problem! You should go to a \"Quit being a baby and leave me alone\" clinic!",
        "Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you’ve just had your first class!",
        "Ohhh, yeah!",
        "I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it.",
        "That’s not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh!",
        "You can’t do anything!",
        "This sucks! I didn’t know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! I’m so tired!",
        "Yeah, well…",
        "Yeah, Rach, I think you’re handling that really well.",
        "I am… (Looks in his date book.) free!",
        "(still looking in date book) Hey! That’s the day after I stop menstruating! (They all look at him.) This isn’t mine.",
        "Joey Tribbiani.",
        "(sleepily) Yeah, she is. Wow! (Falls back asleep, loudly) How you doin’?",
        "What?!",
        "(asleep) So why don’t you give me your number?",
        "(muffled by the mouth guard) Hey you guys! What’s happening?",
        "(muffled) Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it’s gonna help me not to snore.",
        "(takes out the mouth guard) I know I don’t have too! It tastes good. (Puts it back in.)",
        "(muffled by the mouth guard) Dude! I am trying to sleep! (Shrugs to say, \"What’s up with that?\")",
        "Are you kidding? I love that guy! (Starts singing) Morning’s here! Morning is here—",
        "See, this is a great apartment.",
        "Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants.",
        "You have Knicks tickets?",
        "(examining the tickets) Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!",
        "Yeah!",
        "You’re not stupid. You’re meaner than I thought.",
        "Yeah, you do!",
        "Come on!",
        "Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?",
        "Oh come—look, when I was a kid my dad’s company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn’t in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!",
        "Hey!",
        "We don’t make enough fun of you already?",
        "Oh-no, don’t try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.",
        "What?",
        "All right look, Ross, he’s right. Emily’s great, she’s great! But this way too soon, you’re only gonna scare her!",
        "No! You don’t want to wreck it, you don’t want to go to fast!",
        "Wait-wait-wait-wait! (To Chandler) Come on! Come on, let’s trade! The timing’s perfect, I just clogged the toilet!",
        "Yes! Didn’t you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn’t read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!",
        "It’s the Knicks!",
        "Whoa!",
        "Huh.",
        "Yeah, the Knicks rule all!",
        "Done!",
        "Oh.",
        "Ooh, we could end up with nothing.",
        "Ooh, I like that.",
        "Come on man, you know I’d do it for you! Because, you’re my best friend.",
        "All right!",
        "Okay!",
        "What’s the game?! What’s the game?!",
        "Uhh, they’re tall.",
        "Oh.",
        "Yeah! Okay. (Joey picks a card.) Phoebe, you look, I can’t.",
        "Okay. Okay. (He looks at the card.) Ace!",
        "What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!",
        "Okay.",
        "Uh-huh, not as high as…(picks a card) It worked! King!",
        "Why?!",
        "Seriously, good game though. Good game. (He tries to congratulate them, but they pull away.) (To Chandler) What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!",
        "Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y’know, kinda like a peace offering.",
        "Hey, want a beer? (Hands him a beer and sits down in one of the chairs.) (Jumping up.) WHOA!!!!",
        "I don’t know.",
        "I don’t want to move again!",
        "That was one good minute!",
        "Good night.",
        "Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.",
        "Yeah! Yeah!",
        "Monica and Rachel made out. (Giggles like a schoolboy and Monica glares at him.)",
        "Hey! (Singing) Get into gear!",
        "(happily) Okay!",
        "Hey!",
        "Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, don’t you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?",
        "What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!",
        "Come on Ross! Look, I-I don’t have any brothers; I’ll never get to be a best man!",
        "(pause) I’ll never get to be a best man!",
        "(impatiently tapping Chandler on the shoulder) What about me?! You-you just said I could!",
        "I can’t believe you’re not picking me.",
        "Yes! (to Chandler) Shame about you man.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Do you guys have like a big bowl I can borrow?",
        "(grabs it) Thanks.",
        "Oh, we’re having a big party tomorrow night. Later! (Starts for the door.)",
        "Nooo, later. (Walks out the door.)",
        "Oh, it’s Ross’s bachelor party.",
        "Are you bachelors?",
        "Are you strippers?",
        "Then you’re not invited. (Starts for the door again.)",
        "Oh-whoa, what party?",
        "Baby shower. Wow! That sounds sooo like something I don’t want to do! Later! (Finally, he makes his exit.)",
        "This is what I’ve got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.",
        "Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I’ve got you, me, and Chandler and I’m gonna invite Gunther ‘cause, well, we’ve been talking about this pretty loud.",
        "All right—oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I’d really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.",
        "Okay! We’ll need a six-pack of Zima.",
        "You got it.",
        "Well, there’s gonna be strippers there. He didn’t say anything about no strippers.",
        "Oh, I chose not to hear that.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther don’t-don’t forget your shirt. (He gives Gunther his shirt and Gunther leaves.)",
        "Oh, little party favours, check it out! (It’s a shirt that reads, \"Ross Geller, Bachelor Bash 1998\")",
        "Oh-oh! (Shows him what’s on the back, \"Best Man Joey Tribbiani, with a huge picture of him.)",
        "Oh, hey, don’t forget your shirt.",
        "Okay, hey, museum geeks, party’s over. Okay. Wave bye-bye to the nice lady. There you go. Back to your parent’s basement. All right. (The museum geeks exit and Joey unlocks his door and lets the chick and the duck out.) Come on boys, come on out! Here you go. All right.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Oh yeah-yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this. Stare at the wall. (The duck complies.) Hardly move. (The duck complies.) Be white. (The duck complies.)",
        "Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin’ ya. And listen if any of my friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday…",
        "Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around.",
        "Yeah. I’ll let you play with my duck.",
        "Hey, (realises he doesn’t know her name.) stripper! (He notices that the ring box is open, so he picks it up, sees it’s empty and starts to panic.)",
        "(running and banging on Chandler’s door) The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!",
        "The ring is gone!",
        "Dude, this isn’t funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everything’s cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper’s gone and the ring is gone!",
        "Of course!! (Shrugs.)",
        "Ugh! I don’t know what I’m going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don’t care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn’t an emergency, then what is?",
        "Hey…",
        "So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that’s nice!",
        "I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those…",
        "(laughs, softly) Yeah, the stripper stole it.",
        "Dude, I screwed up, you don’t have to turn me in!",
        "Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they’re gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.",
        "I did that too! They wouldn’t give me her real name or her number. They said, \"If I bothered them again they’d call the police.\" I said, \"If you talk to the police, you tell them I’m missing a ring!\"",
        "Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I…",
        "Oh, that sounds like fun, but we’ve got a ring to find!!",
        "All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won’t recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. (to Ross) You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I’ll be uh, Mr. Wong.",
        "There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!",
        "I don’t get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn’t take it, and I didn’t take it; and you (Chandler) didn’t take it, then who did? (The duck quacks.) Shh! We’re trying to think! (Ross and Chandler realise it at the same moment and stare at Joey, who doesn’t get it. After a short pause, with the duck still quacking, Joey figures it out and starts pointing at the duck.)",
        "If anything should happen to him…",
        "So! Things can go wrong! You don’t know! What if he doesn’t make it?!",
        "Yeah, but what if he doesn’t? He’s such a good duck.",
        "I’m so worried about him, y’know?",
        "H-h-h-how’s the duck?",
        "Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.",
        "No, it’s not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!",
        "Yeah, it is! You wouldn’t have lost the ring, right? Y’know what, Ross you were right from the start, he (Chandler) should be your best man.",
        "Now, don’t argue with me…",
        "Really?",
        "(starting to cry) I gotta go check something over here. (He walks away so that they can’t see him cry.)",
        "Well, that went well. Yeah.",
        "(To the gang) Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?",
        "Hey, what’s up? (He has solved the problem of eating the steak, he’s eating it with his hands.)",
        "Well, I figured we’re in another country, so it doesn’t count.",
        "(approaching) Ross, hey, the band’s ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so…",
        "You spit on me man! (Wipes his face.)",
        "Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?",
        "Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!",
        "No you don’t, I just saw you go in there with Monica!",
        "Look, which one of us is gonna be having s*x in there, me or you?",
        "My Giant? I love that movie!",
        "Can I ask you something?",
        "Felicity and I, we’re watching My Giant, and I was thinking, \"I’m never gonna be as good an actor as that giant.\" Do you think I’m just wasting my life with this acting thing?",
        "I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y’know, you think I’ll ever get there?",
        "Thanks man.",
        "But what about how much taller he is than me?",
        "I mean, there’s no way I can make myself taller now, y’know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?",
        "Hey, Monica, wow you’ve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.",
        "Had the beef-tips, huh?",
        "Hi!",
        "All right, I’m gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.",
        "Why would you need to say hi to them, you’ve been feeding them for four days?",
        "I know. Ross is getting married.",
        "Everybody’s doing stuff!",
        "(snaps his fingers) We could climb Mt. Everest!",
        "No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Hey!",
        "We’re gonna climb Mt. Everest!",
        "We could get that Everest video though.",
        "And while we’re down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! (Chandler’s excited.) Oh, y’know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.",
        "Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Yeah we are!",
        "It's never gonna happen.",
        "Don’t answer that.",
        "Awful! Horrible!",
        "She was nothing compared to you.",
        "Ewwwww!",
        "(taking apart the invitation) Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper! You’re at the wedding, you have to cry, \"Handkerchief?\" \"No-no, I got my invitation.\"",
        "Hey!",
        "Don’t worry man, I get to bring a guest. We’ll show him.",
        "I knew that! (They all look at him) I sooo didn’t know that, but you should see your faces.",
        "Heyyy. (They all try and hide their invitations.)",
        "He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.",
        "Ohhh.",
        "Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.",
        "It’s better! You can’t go to a museum in your underwear!",
        "I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!",
        "Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!",
        "It’s all London, baby! Here we go. (He takes a picture of a less than enthused Chandler and starts towards the girls’ apartment.)",
        "Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don’t want to lose that.",
        "Ohh!! (Runs to his room.)",
        "Woo-hoo!!",
        "London baby!",
        "(louder) London baby!!",
        "Bye, Pheebs!",
        "London baby!! (And Rachel slowly closes the door, sadly.)",
        "Come on! Do something!",
        "Okay, here! (Gives him the camera.) I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey. (Joey folds out his \"pop-up\" map of London. All of the major landmarks pop-up like in a pop-up book.)",
        "It’s London, baby! All right, the hotel’s here. (Points to the map.) Wait. No, we wanna go… No. I know. (Sets the map down.) I’m gonna have to go into the map. (So Joey literally steps into the map.)",
        "I got it! (Picks up the map and starts walking.) Here we go.",
        "Shhh! (Pause) Man, you made me lose it! (He goes into the map again.)",
        "All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I’ve ever seen. Hey! (Pushes Chandler in front of the camera.) Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?",
        "Really? To what?",
        "Man, you are Westminster Crabby. (He starts chasing Chandler towards the Abbey.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Check this out? Huh? (Joey has this big tall hat with a British flag on the front of it.) Yeah. That’s the stuff. What do you think?",
        "Well, I like it. Here you go. (He pays for the hat.)",
        "Oh, I embarrass you?",
        "Oh yeah? (Puts the hat on.) If you’re gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh. (Takes off the hat.) Sorry!",
        "Me too.",
        "Noo!! I’ve had the best day ever! Dude, check this out!",
        "Sh-shh-shh! (He motions for her to watch something he has taped.)",
        "(on tape) Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.",
        "(on tape) Oh, Chandler.",
        "That’s Fergie baby!!",
        "Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I’m in my map and-and…(Ross enters) Hey!",
        "Wait up! (They both run to the bathroom.)",
        "Yeah. (Pause) Hey, I hope Ross didn’t think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!",
        "(on phone) Hey, Pheebs! It’s Joey!",
        "That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?",
        "Kinda, but I’ve just been having way too much fun.",
        "No, I don’t think so.",
        "Who’s seven?",
        "Ahh, the babies miss me?",
        "What? You ordered pizza without me?!",
        "Two pizzas?!",
        "Wait, well, where did you get it from?!",
        "What’s in it?",
        "(Looking up at the waiter)That’s not food...No, I don’t, no...(Taps Chandler on the shoulder.) Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can’t even remember what Phoebe looks like.",
        "(Pointing  at Chandler.) Your different here too. Your mean in England. (Chandler throws his hands up to his head in frustration. They walk away from each other.)",
        "Hey, best man number two, Joey Tribbiani. Now I’m not good with the jokes like Chandler here. Boy...but ahh, I just want to say congratulation to the happy couple. I first met Ross in this coffee house back home...Home...New York City...Where everybody knows my name. Well anyway, I love you guys. (pointing at everyone.) But not as much as I love America. (Looking at Chandler.) Could we please..go home now?",
        "(Putting his arm around her.) I’m not going anywhere, sweetheart.",
        "Hello?",
        "Hey. I spent the night out. I met this cute bridesmaid. She is so...",
        "Ahh Pheebs, you know you’re still my number one girl.",
        "Ohh great!!!",
        "(Confused.) But, he loves Emily?",
        "Okay.",
        "Hold on. Hold on. (Picking up a note pad and writing and reading the message aloud.) Rachel coming. Do...Something.",
        "Right!",
        "Hey.",
        "Have you seen Monica?",
        "(With a confused look on his face.) What?",
        "Look we’ve got to find her. Phoebe just called!! Rachel’s coming to tell Ross she loves him!!",
        "I know! That’s why we got to find Monica!! You know where she is?",
        "(Whispering.) Pisst, Monica. Alright, we really need to start looking out for Rachel. I’ll cover the front door. You watch that big hole at the back of the building and I got Chandler covering Ross.",
        "Okay. (They both walk off to watch for Rachel.)",
        "Hey, Felicity.",
        "Yeah.",
        "(In a New York accent.) Fuggetaboutit. (She giggles.) How you doin?",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "(Smiling.) Ohh great!! (Putting the phone to his ear.) Hello. (He begins to escort her down the aisle.)",
        "No, but it’s okay. She just came in and gave him a hug, that it.",
        "No.",
        "Ah, I’m-I’m walking down the aisle...Still walking. (Mrs. Waltham takes her place.) I’m about to pass the bridesmaid I hooked up with last night. (Looking at the bridesmaid.) Hey! (Talking to Phoebe.) I told her \"Hey.\" And now I’m at the front with Ross. It’s Phoebe. (He shows Ross the phone.) He looks pretty mad. Uh...I’d better go.",
        "Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!",
        "Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?",
        "Okay.",
        "You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?",
        "All right!",
        "Mornin' Pheebs!",
        "(interrupting) Was his name Angus? (Monica and Chandler laugh.)",
        "Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London.",
        "Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh…",
        "Hey, Ross, Bodington's!",
        "That was good beer.",
        "Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.",
        "Later! (Exits.)",
        "(To Chandler) I bet it was about her a little.",
        "Say that to him and you're golden. (She just glares at him.)",
        "Hey, Pheebs!",
        "(Jumping out of his way) See ya!! (To the girls.) What the hell was that?!",
        "(Poking his head out.) Havin' some trouble?",
        "I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.",
        "(In tremendous pain) All right. Good deal.",
        "Uh, okay, Pheebs?",
        "Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?",
        "All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!",
        "Yeah, all of us! All day!",
        "Phoebe!",
        "Mine!",
        "Nooo, I said we needed a new plan.",
        "Which, is the new plan!",
        "Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?",
        "Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This (His video camera) is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?",
        "I gotta get the before shot!",
        "Oh! (In an announcer type voice) And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee! (He grabs his side and doubles over in pain.)",
        "Ooh, something hurts!",
        "Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.",
        "Oh my!",
        "Not in my head.",
        "(in a sexy voice) Yep! There's always room for Jell-O…",
        "Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, (snaps his fingers and in a sexy voice) Grandma's chicken salad…",
        "(entering) Ross! Get a shot of this. (He's carrying an issue of the USA Today and hands Ross the camera.) Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies… (Throws the paper away to reveal a copy of Playpen, which is the TV version of Playboy Magazine.) Check it out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff. (Joey opens the magazine and Ross sticks the camera in it.)",
        "Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.",
        "Yeah, I was bummed too.",
        "I think Saturday--(groans in pain again).",
        "(entering from the elevator caring gifts for the kids) Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop. (He doubles over in pain in front an old man in a wheel chair.) Get up! Get up! Get up! (The old man waves him away.)",
        "Umm, well, what else could it be?",
        "Or?",
        "Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up.",
        "(interrupting) Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up, up is not an option--what's a urethra? (Monica whispers what it is in his ear.) Are you crazy?!",
        "Ohh, get these things out of me!",
        "I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs! (He starts rocking back and forth, taking Ross with him.)",
        "Argh!",
        "Argh!",
        "Oh my God.",
        "They're so small! (Both he and Ross look at them with satisfied looks on their faces.)",
        "Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!",
        "(to Monica and Rachel) He's talking to London!",
        "Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.",
        "Ross! Way to suck up to the family.",
        "(entering, wearing a tux) Hey!",
        "Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.",
        "Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!",
        "A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!",
        "Why don’t you like PBS, Pheebs?",
        "I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.",
        "Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!",
        "Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?",
        "It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.",
        "Well, may I ask for one example?",
        "That's because all people are selfish.",
        "Are you calling you people? (Chandler rolls his eyes.) Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?",
        "That he doesn't exist.",
        "(To the pledge volunteers) How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!",
        "That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.",
        "But I'm the host!",
        "You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.",
        "(on phone) Hey Mon!",
        "See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure.",
        "Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now? (He waves his hand in front of the woman next to him and you can now see his arm on TV.)",
        "Hello New York! (The woman bats his hand out of the way.)",
        "(in a bored voice) PBS telethon.",
        "What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?",
        "Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.",
        "Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?",
        "Come on man! You've been here all day!",
        "(in an unenthusiastic voice) PBS Telethon.",
        "Hey Pheebs!",
        "$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?",
        "And you don't a little good about donating the money?",
        "A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.",
        "Monica? What time is it?",
        "But it's dark out.",
        "I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise. (He goes into the bathroom.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Doesn’t seem like it's going to work, I mean…",
        "Hi!",
        "So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.",
        "(holding a box) Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.",
        "You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.",
        "Hey, you're back!",
        "How was your conference?",
        "Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?",
        "Hey, you're back too!",
        "Hey, how was your chef thing?",
        "(sticking his head out the door) What are you guys woofing about?",
        "Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!",
        "You want my advice?",
        "You're not gonna like it.",
        "You got married to fast.",
        "I told ya.",
        "Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.",
        "Hi, Rach.",
        "I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there. (Points over his shoulder.)",
        "Hey, you're not Kip!",
        "Who cares? You're Rachel! (To Chandler) Who's Kip?",
        "Oh, that poor b*st*rd.",
        "Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.",
        "'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.",
        "Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. (Pause.) Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!",
        "(entering) (He clears his throat to get their attention.) Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.",
        "(shocked) Oh! Ohh! Oh!!",
        "Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!",
        "Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!",
        "(To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!",
        "How?! When?!",
        "IN LONDON!!!",
        "But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!",
        "All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but…",
        "Aww, I don't want to see that!",
        "I guess I'm done.",
        "I think I'm gonna take-off.",
        "(entering) Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!",
        "Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.",
        "Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! (Starts for his room.) And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.",
        "(from the bedroom) I can hear that!",
        "I can still hear you!",
        "Hey!",
        "Argh-argh!! (Catches the coat.) Ooh, soft. Is this mink?",
        "Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?",
        "(after Ross is gone) What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?",
        "No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!",
        "No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.",
        "I'll take it!",
        "Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! (He drapes it around his shoulders.) Enh? All right, what do you think?",
        "What's the matter Ross?",
        "That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! (Phoebe pinches him.) Which is great! I love to ride that rail!",
        "Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? (Phoebe pinches him again.) Ow!! He's not even here!!!",
        "Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?",
        "Yeah, you fogged Danny.",
        "Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.",
        "Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing (The shutters that close off the kitchen.) and it kinda knocked me out a little?",
        "Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?",
        "You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!",
        "It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally-(The gang enters behind Joey and Phoebe pinches him again.)-Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.",
        "We all hate Emily!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!",
        "I kinda feel like it's my fault.",
        "Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out! (He glares at Chandler.)",
        "Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.",
        "Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.",
        "Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.",
        "Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. (Makes like he's juggling.) Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone…",
        "(thinks) I'm not sure.",
        "RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!",
        "All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor…",
        "It's almost as if he knew.",
        "Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel!!",
        "I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.",
        "You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. (He stands up and turns his back to them so that he is facing the window.) Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. (The camera cuts to Ross outside hanging up the phone.) Smile! (Ross turns around and sees Joey alternately smiling and frowning and just stares at him for a second and heads back inside.)",
        "What happened? What happened?",
        "I need something sweet.",
        "Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.",
        "Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs. (Note: Actually, I think every guy is thankful for thongs. That and spandex. J )",
        "I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?",
        "Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!",
        "Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.",
        "Hey, it's not like it sounds.",
        "(muffled) Hello?",
        "Phoebe?",
        "Look. (He walks out of the bathroom with his head stuck in a huge turkey.)",
        "I know! It's stuck!!!",
        "I put it on to scare Chandler!",
        "Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.",
        "It's Joey.",
        "I can't! It-it's stuck!",
        "Sorry! Sorry.",
        "(pointing) It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!",
        "(turning all the way around, and still not facing Chandler) Yeah, you are! (Starts dancing.) I scared you!",
        "Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, \"Butternut squash?\" And it came out, \"Squatternut buash?\"",
        "You're a dork.",
        "No, look. (Shows him the magazine.)",
        "I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.",
        "Why?",
        "Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Okay.",
        "Ross?",
        "Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't—I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.",
        "Hey, all right!",
        "(To Chandler) You're fake laughing too, right?",
        "Hey.",
        "Nothing.",
        "(smiles) Kinda.",
        "Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.",
        "Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!",
        "Sorry.",
        "Ahhhhhhhhhh…",
        "Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?",
        "No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the boxes. Come on!",
        "All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this? (Imitates Ross's 'quiet down' maneuver, but does move his hands up and down he just flaps his hands as if he's waving good-bye.)",
        "No, the quiet down thing!",
        "Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been p0rn?",
        "All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.",
        "YES!!",
        "Um-hmm.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!",
        "Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!",
        "Umm, yum!",
        "Mine! (He grabs it.)",
        "Oh that's mine too! (Grabs it and Ross looks at him.) I'm Italian!",
        "But it's available now! Isn't it?",
        "Hey, let's go look at it! (They both jump up.)",
        "Okay!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.",
        "But hey, Ross, this place is available now!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, it's perfect!",
        "He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! (Pause.) You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?",
        "Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yeah!",
        "I don't know. Maybe pizza?",
        "Oh! Oh!",
        "Hello! (Listens.) Oh yeah! (To Chandler) It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. (To the apartment manager.) Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.",
        "(getting up) Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine! (He tries to take a step and falls flat on his face.)",
        "Hey!",
        "You're kidding!",
        "But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies!",
        "Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there (Points to where the window is but sees that there isn't any space there and points towards his door.) by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!",
        "Definitely!",
        "All right!",
        "Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!",
        "Yeah, they're mine.",
        "I don't know uhh… (Pause as he thinks about it.) Well, I'm Joey. Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes.",
        "(reluctantly taking them) Chandler? A word.",
        "That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop! (Realizes he still has the underwear in his hand.) Ahh! (Throws them towards Chandler's room.) And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?",
        "Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! (To Monica) Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and (He puts his leg on the chair and pulls up his pants leg to reveal that he now has shaved legs.)",
        "Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't…",
        "Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the s*x makes it easier!",
        "All right! But, (To Monica) you do it with me once.",
        "Didn't think so.",
        "Hey, Pheebs!",
        "What's wrong buddy?",
        "I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.",
        "So you uh, still wondering?",
        "You're smart. I like that.",
        "Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!",
        "Hiya.",
        "I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films. (Points at Chandler, angrily.)",
        "You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!",
        "Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!",
        "Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?",
        "Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!",
        "All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. (Starts for his room.) Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!",
        "Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!",
        "No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just… I just… Kinda…",
        "Thank you!",
        "What?!! (He turns around and stares at Chandler who's silently pleading with Joey to go along with it.) No I'm not!!",
        "No! No! I am not a s*x addict!",
        "No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!",
        "(thinking) I slept with Monica.",
        "Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.",
        "Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?",
        "Ahh—oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?",
        "No! If anyone's a s*x addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!",
        "That makes sense!",
        "Uhh, Monica?",
        "But sadly I could not be enticed.",
        "Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs. (Offers it to everyone.)",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Why are you doing this?",
        "Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You’ve got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven’t you ever been unemployed?",
        "Hey, don’t get religious on me, ok. (Ross looks a little confused.) A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here…sit down. (Ross sits down.) Ready? (Joey flips the foot rest up.) Ahh!! (He reclines the chair fully.) Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!",
        "Ohh, no, no. We’re not going to just sit. (Joey sits down and hits the speed dial button on the phone.) Shhh. (It begins to ring.)",
        "(In a high pitched female voice) Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.",
        "But, I love you.",
        "And that’s Wednesday. (He reclines in his chair.) Ohh.",
        "So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?",
        "How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens.",
        "She’s a woman!",
        "(Very discouraged) Okay, is there anything else?",
        "That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!",
        "Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?",
        "Wait a second, I could star in it!",
        "I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.",
        "Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!",
        "Thanks!",
        "Done!",
        "It's not.",
        "(disappointed) Oh.",
        "Hey, how do you spell suspicious?",
        "Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.",
        "You're driving me crazy with that!",
        "Don’t stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!",
        "Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.",
        "Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.",
        "(jumping up) All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?",
        "All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.",
        "Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.",
        "Uh yeah, right here. (He punches his fist through the wall next to the door.)",
        "Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.",
        "You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.",
        "Hey!",
        "(To Chandler) I didn't finish my five pages.",
        "Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.",
        "Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.",
        "Come on look guys, don't fight.",
        "Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!",
        "Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.",
        "Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture—I didn't have my camera!",
        "Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.",
        "They're brother and sister!!!",
        "(entering) Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!",
        "No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!",
        "Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?",
        "Okay. (Reading.) \"It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out.\" Ross (Points to him.)",
        "Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.",
        "A handsome man enters. (Playing the part of the handsome man.) Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, (Ross) you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you (Chandler) well you co-created Fireball. The end.",
        "No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball. (Takes out a bowling ball and a propane torch.) Ha-ha!",
        "(Reading the scene set up.) Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.",
        "What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!",
        "Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.",
        "Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.",
        "(thinks) I don't know.",
        "I don't know.",
        "(thinks) I don't know.",
        "Ohh, I know one thing!",
        "They did it right there on the couch.",
        "Hey Ross!",
        "(eyeing the flattened scone) Anybody gonna eat that?",
        "(entering from his room) All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?",
        "Really?",
        "Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.",
        "All right, let's go Pheebs.",
        "Maybe we should check the trash chute.",
        "That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.",
        "(snaps his fingers) He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.",
        "He hooked up!! Tell us about her!",
        "All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.",
        "Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!",
        "Damnit Phoebe!!",
        "All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?",
        "All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. (He removes the waste bucket that's over the duck and the laundry basket that's over the chicken.) And they're off! (He puts his foot in front of the chick, stopping it from moving.)",
        "Judge rules, no violation.",
        "Yeah!",
        "What?!",
        "And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!",
        "Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.",
        "Yeah.",
        "(entering) Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?",
        "Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.",
        "Umm, hi.",
        "Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.",
        "Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat! (He picks a hat up from the floor. It's one of those magician stovepipe hats.)",
        "Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.",
        "Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.",
        "Great! Thanks, Rach!",
        "All right.",
        "Are you all right?",
        "Pheebs! Sorry!",
        "Pheebs, I'm so sorry.",
        "All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.",
        "Really? A purse?",
        "It looks like a women's purse.",
        "See look, women, carrying the bag. (He puts it on his shoulder and looks at himself in the mirror and likes what he sees.) But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.",
        "Maybe you need s*x. I had s*x a couple days ago.",
        "Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.",
        "Hey!",
        "What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!",
        "Yeah, but sandwich time is right now. (Removes a sandwich and starts eating.)",
        "Why would I return it? I love this bag!",
        "Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard? (He's holding the fake credit cards that come with the bag.)",
        "All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.",
        "U-N-I-sexy? (Smiles provocatively.)",
        "Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry.",
        "Here, I brought you some flowers. (He pulls them out of the bag.)",
        "(approaches, wearing his glasses) Hey you guys, check it out. Check it out. (Moves his hand towards and away from his face.) It's like it's coming right at me. (Chandler helps out a little bit by pushing on Joey's arm, which causes his hand to slap him in his face.)",
        "What did you say to him?",
        "(entering, with bag) Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?",
        "Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, (pats the bag) comes with a bag! (Exits.)",
        "(reading from the script) Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink.",
        "Yeah, sure. (He takes it off and starts reading.) Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should—I'm sorry, can I ask you something? (He stops and asks a question.)",
        "Well, first it's not a purse.",
        "I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's bag!",
        "All right look, let me show you the catalog! (Does so.) See? Huh? It's the latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!",
        "Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.",
        "Yeah but I didn’t read anything.",
        "Okay! All right, I'll see ya. (As he's walking off stage.) (Patting the bag.) We got it! We got it!",
        "(dejected) Hi.",
        "Estelle said I didn't get it. (Sits down next to Rachel on the couch.)",
        "Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.",
        "Well to tell you the truth, they uh, (Pause) they had a problem with the bag!",
        "Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!",
        "I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? (She's avoiding his eyes.) Oh, you think I should give up the bag!",
        "I can't believe I'm hearing this!",
        "All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!",
        "What's the matter?!",
        "All right, I'll take care of it.",
        "Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or Phoebe?",
        "Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister.",
        "Chandler.",
        "Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Okay, great!",
        "Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!",
        "Rach! Rach! Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight.",
        "So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler?",
        "Yeah!",
        "So did that do anything for ya?",
        "All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.",
        "Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true.",
        "Really? Who-who have you taught?",
        "Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!",
        "Hey!",
        "Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?",
        "You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?",
        "Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet! (Chandler is straining to keep quiet as Phoebe enters.)",
        "See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson.",
        "Umm, okay.",
        "Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out. (Holds up his hand in one of Phoebe's chords.)",
        "Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and…",
        "No.",
        "Yes!",
        "Yeah! (Chandler bangs the table in frustration.)",
        "You look like a freak.",
        "Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well. (Does a chord and Monica starts taking pictures of him and Phoebe. They both start to strike a pose with the excessive amount of pictures that Monica takes.)",
        "Yes! Yes, I did.",
        "(thinks) (quietly) G-sharp.",
        "What?! I didn't touch a guitar!",
        "No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! (Notices Monica standing between them and smiling.) What?! (The camera clicks, taking another picture.)",
        "Your other student, was you!",
        "(looking in the Yellow Pages) Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!! (Storms out.)",
        "(answering phone) Hello?",
        "Uhh, Chandler's not here.",
        "Okay.",
        "Nice!",
        "Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?",
        "Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.",
        "Umm, do you see any—oh, Vaseline?",
        "Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.",
        "Ross? You okay?",
        "Really?! Uhh, what color is it?",
        "Well, I'm just—if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!",
        "(To Ross) Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out. (He hangs up the phone and strands Ross in the bathroom.)",
        "Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.",
        "What-what is it, what is it?",
        "Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!",
        "I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!",
        "And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!",
        "I'm not listening to you!",
        "Hey, Pheebs?",
        "Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready. (After a short pause she hands him her guitar.) You really think I'm ready?",
        "Wow! Cool! (He takes the guitar, stands up, and goes to play a note. However, while strumming it, he knocks it out of his hands and it bounces off the table and lands on the floor. Phoebe just stares at the guitar.)",
        "(sitting back down) Was the chord at least right…",
        "Howdy partner!",
        "Umm?",
        "Oh, no! (Starts that screaming thing again. Rachel stops him by pulling his fingers out of his ears.)",
        "Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!",
        "Now? You want me to go over there now?",
        "Do you know something?",
        "I might know something.",
        "What's the thing you know?",
        "I can't tell you what I know.",
        "Okay, fine.",
        "You don't know!",
        "(gasps) YOU KNOW!!!!",
        "Yeah, I know!!!!",
        "Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen… (Phoebe returns and interrupts them.)",
        "Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain.",
        "Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!",
        "(entering) Hey guys!",
        "What? What?",
        "You mean how they're friends and nothing more? (Glares at Rachel.)",
        "Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!",
        "No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.",
        "I can't take any…",
        "Noo! I can't take any more secrets! (To Rachel) I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!",
        "Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal. (Joey shies away.)",
        "Ugh.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Well I didn't tell them!",
        "Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.",
        "And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!",
        "I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!",
        "No! Not unless! Look this must end now!",
        "I'm listening.",
        "So he likes to break stuff.",
        "Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.",
        "No.",
        "They know you know.",
        "I couldn't even if I wanted too.",
        "(looking out the window) Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!",
        "(entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!",
        "Ooh!",
        "I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)",
        "It's not my first time.",
        "Dude!",
        "All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!",
        "(panicking) Dude! He's right there!",
        "Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business? (Ross turns and glares at him.) Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister.",
        "(quickly) I call Godfather!",
        "Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.",
        "(to her) Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie.",
        "So, are you ready to go?",
        "Oh sure, right back there. (Points.)",
        "I was thinking Chinese food.",
        "I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but…",
        "(shyly) She keeps punching me.",
        "Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? (Quietly) She-she-she's hurting me.",
        "(sets the coffee down) Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.",
        "Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.",
        "Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.",
        "No-no.",
        "Yeah, big!",
        "Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.",
        "Hey!",
        "Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?",
        "Well look, I’m breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?",
        "Hey! Hiya!",
        "Huh.",
        "Uhh….",
        "Nah.",
        "What a bad idea!",
        "She's right y'know.",
        "Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?",
        "Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.",
        "That's not funny at all!",
        "Okay, pick a card.",
        "All right now, memorize it. (Pause) You got it?",
        "(holding up the Queen of Clubs) Is that your card? (He winks and smiles.)",
        "(reading the card) Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! (Ross gasps) Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!! (Ross and Carol stare at him, then Joey realizes what he just said.) I mean, way to go Ben! (Gives Ben the thumbs up, which Ben returns.) Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.",
        "I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!",
        "Luck!",
        "Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.",
        "Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!",
        "Done.",
        "They're gonna do it together.",
        "What, so I gotta shut it down now?",
        "Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?",
        "Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.",
        "What?! Are you kidding?!",
        "All right!",
        "Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!",
        "I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her…",
        "Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad….",
        "That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?",
        "I look more like him than you do! (He winks at Carol.)",
        "(also downtrodden) Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.",
        "(Happily) Yeah I did!",
        "Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so…",
        "Who knows?",
        "Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!",
        "Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.",
        "Hey Pheebs! (To the guys) Hey!",
        "Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.",
        "Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.",
        "That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!",
        "I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!",
        "What? Chandler! Tell 'em!",
        "At least I care about his feelings!",
        "Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn’t get it?",
        "Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!",
        "You just give him a spoon baby!",
        "Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!",
        "Yeah?! So's yours!",
        "Hmmm, soup! (Tries again.) Hmm soup! (Tries again, with a little caveman thrown in.) Hmm, soup!",
        "Oh yeah, no problem.",
        "(goes over to Ben) Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.",
        "(angrily) Ross!",
        "Hi!",
        "Uh-oh.",
        "Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.",
        "Oh, what did I say?",
        "How's that different? (She looks at him until he gets it.) Oh! Yeah!",
        "Hmm, noodle soup.",
        "Okay.",
        "Hmm, soup. (Pause.) I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!",
        "No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! (Eats another spoonful) Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit! (Storms out.)",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah right! (Gets up for a refill to his snow cone.)",
        "Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, \"Hmm, noodle soup.\" (Nods his head in disgust.)",
        "What you do mean?",
        "Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.",
        "Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. (Thinks about it.) Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor…",
        "No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.",
        "Thank you! So, did-did he get it?",
        "Eh, what are you gonna do?",
        "Hey!",
        "What are you guys doing up?",
        "(thinks) Dark red.",
        "Aww, you guys are so cute!",
        "All right, I'll see you in the morning.",
        "Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.",
        "Cat.",
        "I love you too.",
        "(entering) Hey, you guys!",
        "(To Monica) Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?",
        "Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I’m not him.",
        "No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!",
        "No! No, you smell like a meadow. (Pause.) I'm sorry. (Runs to the bathroom.)",
        "(To Phoebe) Hey! (Sees that Monica's there.) Oh.",
        "Yeah, I didn’t know you guys were going to be here.",
        "(backing away) What?! Why?!",
        "Nothing!",
        "All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, (pause) but I don't want to talk about it. (Starts for his room.)",
        "Well, it involved Monica.",
        "Don't worry, there wasn't any s*x in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.",
        "Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.",
        "It-it doesn’t?",
        "That kinda sounds like your dream dude.",
        "In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.",
        "(looks at her) Not really.",
        "No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?",
        "Friends first? That's interesting.",
        "No, never done that either.",
        "(in a sexy voice) How you doin'?",
        "Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off, (In a sexy voice) for you.",
        "Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.",
        "Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.",
        "Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great…",
        "…is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, \"Who are my friends?\" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So…",
        "I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.",
        "I'll treat you real nice. (Pulls out a chair for her.)",
        "Won't-won't that take longer?",
        "Yeah. I understand. I understand. (Pause) Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Yeah, yeah, I met this woman. (Starts for his room.)",
        "Uhh, well, she's…really good in bed.",
        "(To Rachel) Well look, hey, it's all your fault!",
        "Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! (Pause) And her roommate!",
        "Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!",
        "(entering) All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!",
        "(taking a bite) Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Uhh, just a minute officer!!",
        "Nice!",
        "Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!",
        "I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.",
        "That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday, (To Monica) same as the day before.",
        "Nope. Op, wait! There he goes.",
        "(waving) Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. (Notices that a woman is waving back.) Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. (She just stares at him.) (Joey sees how beautiful she is.) Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.",
        "Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. (He turns back to the woman.) Okay, here goes. (Thinks.) How (Holds up his hand like an Indian) you (Points at her) a-doin'? (Does a little twisting motion with both hands and ends up pointing at her, he then winks. She smiles and waves again.) (To Monica) It worked! She's waving me over. (Towards the woman.) Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor…",
        "Tell me about it, huh? (Realizes that she can see Monica.) Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! (He pantomimes that out.) Ewwuck! (He pushes Monica away and makes a disgusted face.)",
        "This is your place?",
        "But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man! (Runs away.)",
        "Ugh!!",
        "I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something. (Looks out the window.) Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit. (We see Ross sitting on the couch and flipping through the channels on his remote.)",
        "Did you tell the guy you wanted to have s*x with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?",
        "What happened?",
        "You kissed him?!",
        "I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?",
        "Yeah! (Chandler makes a noise) No?",
        "Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on. (She hugs him and Joey looks out the window.) She's back! Hot girl's back!",
        "No, in Ross's building! (He throws Rachel onto the chair and heads to the window.) She's back! She's back! (Pantomimes) Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. (He counts where she is again.) Got it! (Runs out and does a little hot over a chair.)",
        "Damnit!! Did you move?!",
        "(Looking around) Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?",
        "Yeah. Sorry about that. (He walks away and knocks on the next door which is answered by a little girl.) Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?",
        "Later! (He runs away down the hall and hides behind a corner to a whole other corridor.) Oh man! (Walks down the hallway in desperation.) Hot girl! Hot girl!!",
        "(entering) Hey guys! (Sees their state of undress) What 'cha been doin'? (Has a silly grin.)",
        "I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. (He looks out the window.) Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.",
        "Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.",
        "No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.",
        "I did not know that! Thank you Monica. (Starts to leave) I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.",
        "Dahhhhh!! (Ross has a puzzled look on his face.) No! Noooo!! (Storms off.)",
        "(entering, with his grandmother) Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!",
        "Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.",
        "She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me.",
        "Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so…",
        "Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?",
        "Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.",
        "Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.",
        "(walking past) True story! (Goes and sits down.)",
        "Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! (They have two of the cops on the street, then they cut to where they're entering an apartment.) Oh my God.",
        "(smiling) Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.",
        "(smiling) Oh, they cut me out of the show.",
        "(smiling) Not likely.  'Cause you see that body bag right there",
        "(smiling) I'm in it.",
        "(smiling) I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died.",
        "(smiling) No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile! (They all smile.)",
        "Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am! (Points to the screen, of course it isn't him.)",
        "No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.",
        "(To Ross in the kitchen) All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!",
        "I know, I know! What am I going to do? (Thinks) Ooh!",
        "(dejected) Yeah, all right. (Thinks of something.) Ooh! (He quickly runs out before anyone can stop him.)",
        "(entering) Hey! Is the show still on?",
        "(says hi to his grandma) Look! Oh! (Pointing out the window.) Is that the Pope?! (Chandler and his grandma turn to look and Joey slips a tape into the VCR.)",
        "Oh, here I am, here's my big scene!",
        "(on the tape) All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it!",
        "That's right!",
        "(on the tape) Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars. (The duck quacks, to the duck) Choo! Choo! Choo! (To the imaginary cops) Filled with $100,000 in small bills, and if I don't get it…(the duck quacks louder) Choo!! And if I don't get it, (pause, picks up the duck) I'm gonna shoot this duck!",
        "(on the tape) I'm comin' out! (He opens the door and hops out pointing the gun in all directions and then runs out of view.)",
        "(to his grandmother) That's uh, scenes from next week's show. Next week's!",
        "Oh, yeah, good idea.",
        "Ooh, Ross, look! Look! (Points behind Ross.)",
        "Right over there! Right there! Look-look-look!",
        "(to the rest of the gang) Somebody help me out here!",
        "You got to go on a ride along?!",
        "I want to go on a ride along!",
        "(returning from a deli) Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world!",
        "Oh-ho, yeah!",
        "Yep!",
        "(dejected) Yeah okay. (To Chandler) Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.",
        "Yeah, okay.",
        "Did I say you could smell it?!",
        "Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!",
        "Okay, imagine the best s*x you've ever had.",
        "Are you thinking about Monica?",
        "Yeah, what's that like?",
        "Come on man! (To Gary) Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?",
        "Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!",
        "Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?",
        "Is everything okay?",
        "(To Ross) You okay man?",
        "Hi.",
        "Yeah, I didn't know that.",
        "Bye!",
        "Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!",
        "Dude! How come you took off?",
        "Is something wrong?",
        "Okay.",
        "That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!",
        "Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.",
        "I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!",
        "Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I…knew…you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!",
        "Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.",
        "I know it doesn't make much sense…",
        "Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!",
        "I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is (Goes and picks up the sandwich) the greatest sandwich in the world!",
        "No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!",
        "Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, (He unwraps the sandwich and holds it out for Chandler) here.",
        "No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!",
        "How good is that?",
        "See?",
        "Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!",
        "Yeah. With a bite! (Takes back the sandwich.) Gee-e-e-eez!",
        "Yeah, hero sandwiches. (Points at Ross who points back.)",
        "Uhhh, mine too! Yeah.",
        "Me too! Me too! Me too! (Yeah, he does the same thing.)",
        "Yeah, I got too excited!",
        "(entering, depressed) Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. (Pause, then very excitedly) I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!",
        "It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears… But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, \"Where's Betsy?\" Right? And she says, \"Betsy's been dead for 10 years.\"",
        "And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! (To Chandler) And you know what that means buddy!",
        "Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!",
        "All right! Thanks Pheebs!",
        "Oh umm, not go.",
        "I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?",
        "Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?",
        "Great! Problem solved!",
        "Well, back to square one.",
        "(quickly) Yes!",
        "Peanut butter!",
        "A swimmer!",
        "Monica. Oh… huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.",
        "Ascot!",
        "North route!",
        "Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!",
        "Hey man, what's up?",
        "Sure, what do you want to see?",
        "Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game!",
        "I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay?",
        "What do you like better action or comedy?",
        "Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?",
        "Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.",
        "Hey! You ready to go?",
        "Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!",
        "Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.",
        "Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.",
        "Did you not hear the plot of the movie? \"She's been dead for ten years.\" I'm gonna be a millionaire!",
        "Hey!",
        "You got it!",
        "Bye-bye!",
        "Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?",
        "See ya! (Walks out.)",
        "Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.",
        "Don't worry, it's out there! (Just then a horn honks and Joey quickly looks at the road.) I think I just need lunch.",
        "You wanna eat? (Pulls out the twenty) My treat!",
        "Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?",
        "Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!",
        "Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?",
        "Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?",
        "Is this movie gonna be my big break?",
        "(shocked) What?!",
        "Dude you said, \"No!\"",
        "You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?",
        "I don't believe this!",
        "What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!",
        "Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.",
        "Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.",
        "Not if you're gonna be like this!",
        "Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!",
        "Fine! (He slams on the brakes, stopping the car on the bridge to the sound of numerous car horns.) Get out!",
        "Get out!!",
        "(on a pay phone holding a box) Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!",
        "Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.",
        "Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?",
        "Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.",
        "Wh-what?! Why?!",
        "(laughs) You're kidding right?",
        "What?!",
        "Uh, hang out?! How long?",
        "No!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Thanks. (The grip walks away.) (Reading the card.) Congratulations on your big break.",
        "(on phone from Vegas) Hey Monica, it's Joey!",
        "Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!",
        "Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!",
        "(to the family) Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'.",
        "Everybody smile! (The picture is taken) Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific! (The family leaves.) Kill me. Kill me now.",
        "(entering with Phoebe) Come on Pheebs! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!",
        "Hey!",
        "Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isn’t that why you guys are here?",
        "Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?",
        "Mornin’ Pheebs. (Sits down.) Well, my movie has officially been canceled.",
        "Nah, I’m too depressed to eat. I’ll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess I’ll just fly home with you guys, what time’s your flight?",
        "I don’t need that anymore.",
        "I don’t want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. (Gets an idea.) Oh—ooh! How about you come with me?",
        "It’ll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship.",
        "Sure?",
        "Hey.",
        "Where is the waitress?! I’m starving!",
        "Oh, here’s where I win all my money back! (Gets up and heads for the buffet table with Chandler in tow.)",
        "Sure! What’s up? (He grabs a plate and proceeds to load it with a huge pile of scrambled eggs. Chandler just stares at him and Joey reluctantly gives him a spoonful.)",
        "Oh my God! That’s huge! (Hugs him.) Wait a minute, why come I wasn’t invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don’t say, \"Ross.\" Do not say, \"Ross.\"",
        "Oh! Tell her she’s not marriage material.",
        "Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she’s anything like me, she’s just gonna be relieved.",
        "They let you get married when you’re drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!",
        "An annulment? Ross! I don’t think surgery’s the answer here.",
        "(wakes up) What?!",
        "All right. All right.",
        "Really? I don’t…",
        "(starts singing) I wanna rock and roll all night! (Falls asleep.)",
        "(to himself) Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No! (He opens his eyes and sees a hitchhiker.)",
        "Don’t you think I asked him that before he got in?!",
        "Ooh, I’ll play! I’ll play!",
        "Come on Pheebs! I can’t take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? (Starts singing.) Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!",
        "Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn’t deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.",
        "Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I’ve got a really good one! I’ve been thinking about it since Kansas.",
        "Yes.",
        "That is incredible! You are the master!",
        "What are you doing?",
        "I can fix it. Hold on. (He goes and gets a screwdriver from his apartment) Look out. Look out. (Pries at the door a little bit.)",
        "I’m not finished.",
        "Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me?",
        "Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.",
        "That's it! Thanks Pheebs!",
        "No! (She nods no to Chandler) Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!",
        "Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.",
        "Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?",
        "Don't come out here!",
        "I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!",
        "Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!",
        "Uh, Entertainment Tonight. [Cut to Chandler] Yeah, okay so, good talking to ya and don't come out here. All right. (Hangs up the phone and poses for that picture.)",
        "Hi!",
        "What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.",
        "Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. (To no one in particular) Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.",
        "They uh director. Uhh, her. (Points to an old woman standing behind him. Who glares at him and walks off.) All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.",
        "Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.",
        "Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. (To Chandler) I'm sorry man.",
        "Yeah, what-what's going on?",
        "Dawson?!",
        "Aww, there we go.",
        "Ooh, so close.",
        "Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.",
        "Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here! (Walks away.)",
        "Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.",
        "Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right…",
        "All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.",
        "Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!",
        "Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!",
        "Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!",
        "(to the dealer) Can I change a hundred? (He hands him his chip.)",
        "(betting all 100) Let's ride.",
        "Hit me! (He does so.) Ohh man! (Joey busts and loses all the money, but when the dealer starts to collect the cards Joey notices something.) Wait! (He holds his hand next to the dealer's hand.)",
        "Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin!",
        "My identical hand twin!",
        "What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!",
        "Don’t you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!",
        "Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!",
        "This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand (Holds up his left hand) twice? Huh?",
        "Hey, are you unsupporting me again?",
        "Pheebs!!",
        "I found my identical hand twin!",
        "(entering) Hey-hey-hey you made it!",
        "All right! Hey-hey!",
        "Who's your friend? He's hot! (Ross laughs and Rachel smacks him with her purse.)",
        "No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin!",
        "My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!",
        "Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb.",
        "(entering) Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?",
        "He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. (Holds up his hand.) See?",
        "Okay! (Walks away, then turns back.) How you doin'?",
        "Right! Okay. (Heads for the bathroom.)",
        "Oh-oh-oh, yeah! (He grabs some towels and takes them to him.) That's right, you take good care of those babies!",
        "It's me, Joey!",
        "(holds up his hand) Joey!",
        "Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!",
        "Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna talk to us!",
        "(stopping him) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! We could have our own show! Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! Huh? And-and-and I wrote a song for us! (Singing, to the tune of This Land is Your Land) This hand is your hand! This hand is my hand! Oh wait, that's your hand! No wait, it's my hand!",
        "(following him) But you haven't even heard the chorus!",
        "Hey!",
        "Hi!",
        "Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have to convince my hand twin to cooperate!",
        "Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! (He starts to leave, but gets an idea and stops.) Hey Rach, how you doin'?",
        "Ross, don't let her drink anymore! (Exits)",
        "(sitting down) Ahhh! (Slides his hands across the table.)",
        "No-no, I don't really have any money. Not yet, anyway… (Shakes his hands.)",
        "(throws down a small wad of money, and as his hand twin starts to unfold it, Joey once again brings attention to their special gift to the world. {Y'know, looking at it now, they really don't have that similar of hands. Joey's are bigger.}) Ooh-ho-ho! (The dealer stares at him and he stops.)",
        "Hit me! (He does so.)",
        "Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table?",
        "Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue?",
        "Me?! Oh come on, man! You can't do this! Come on! (Being dragged out by the guard) I'm your hand twin!!",
        "Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?",
        "Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.",
        "Hey, what time is it?",
        "Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?",
        "Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.",
        "Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! (Checks his pants.) Yeah, my pants are a little loose!",
        "Hey!",
        "What the hell is that?!!",
        "That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}",
        "It's not a cat!",
        "It's not a cat!",
        "Uhh, the ball thing.",
        "Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!",
        "Okay!",
        "(catches the ball) Uh-oh.",
        "I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!",
        "Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!",
        "Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.",
        "Hi!",
        "I don't know.",
        "Oh, I don't know…. Yeah, can't do it.",
        "Yeah, we haven't dropped it in… (Looks to Ross.)",
        "Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.",
        "That's right baby.",
        "Oh yeah, that's right!",
        "Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!",
        "I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We (Ross and him) invented this game!",
        "Did you get your money back?",
        "Oh hey, here Pheebs. (He throws her the ball.)",
        "Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?",
        "(entering) Hey Monica!",
        "(To Chandler) Hey man, you feeling any better? (Chandler answers him with some guttural sounds that only he can make and that no human can transcribe.)",
        "Oh my God! You’re pregnant!",
        "Wow! (Tearing up) Well, uh… Hey! I’m really happy for you guys! Congratulations! (Kisses Monica on the cheek) See you later. (Starts for the door on the verge of tears as Monica stops him.)",
        "Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. (Turns towards the door, pauses, and turns back.) Like you’d believe that. This sucks!",
        "(To Monica) Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you’re gonna be moving in with him I feel it’s my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He’s a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm… Oh-oh he always, he always umm—Oh, who am I kidding! He’s the best roommate ever! (Hugs Chandler.)",
        "God, it’s gonna so weird like when I come home and you’re not here. Y’know? No more Joey and Chan’s. No more J and C’s. \"You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler’s?\" \"Can’t, its not there.\"",
        "Yeah but we won’t be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.",
        "Hi.",
        "Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It’s like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie’s!!",
        "So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?",
        "Really?! Well, when?",
        "Wow.",
        "Great!",
        "Oh-oh, what about Ross?",
        "Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. (Looks at them) Ooohh, to a Porsche! {Transcriber’s note: Oh come on! Who would leave the keys to their Porsche behind? If I had a Porsche, I’d have the keys surgically attached to my hand!} Hey Gunther, these yours?",
        "Na-uh! (To everyone there) Hey did anybody lose their keys?",
        "There’s a lost and found? (Gunther sets the box up on the table.) My shoe! (Grabs it out of the box.)",
        "Well, I didn’t realize until I got home. I wasn’t gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y’know what? I’m gonna go find that guy’s car and leave a note on the windshield. (Goes to do so.)",
        "Great! Thanks. (Exits.)",
        "Yeah, it’s not mine.",
        "Yeah, it’s (looks up and sees the woman) mine.",
        "Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?",
        "(checks in the window to make sure it has them) It’s got ‘em!",
        "(entering) Hey guys!",
        "Hey babies! Oh, I’m having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I’ve got the keys too, still there!",
        "You should see the treatment I get when I’m with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.",
        "The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! (Chandler wipes his forehead with a baby wipe, that might have been used. He drops it disgustedly.) But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they’re gonna start to think that I don’t own it. So I figured I’ll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?",
        "Yeah, she tops out at 130.",
        "And that’s just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.",
        "Sure!",
        "Okay, take it easy.",
        "Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.",
        "Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I’m just polishing her up.",
        "Yeah, but it’s my wax.",
        "Sure. Here. (He hands them over.) I’ll uh, save your parking spot.",
        "Why not?",
        "Yeah, so did I.",
        "(entering wearing nothing but Porsche clothes) So the Porsche guy took his car back.",
        "No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.",
        "Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn’t have the car! Right?",
        "Oh, I’ve been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche. (Starts to leave.)",
        "Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to her! (Storms out.)",
        "Why isn’t that valet back with my Porsche?",
        "(to women passing him) Porsche.",
        "Hi! How are the Gellers?",
        "Hey! It’s Porsche!! (He’s right y’know.)",
        "Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!",
        "Hey! How you doin’?",
        "I’d love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She’s sleeping. (The women both laugh) Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (Just then the same guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapses it. It turns out that Joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a Porsche.)",
        "(To Chandler) Dude! What are yo—you trying to kill me?!",
        "Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?",
        "Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin’ uh, I’m gonna have an extra room over at my place…",
        "Yeah, why don’t you move in with me? It’ll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday’s right?",
        "Hey! (To Chandler) Dude, some guy just called for you.",
        "I don’t know! How about, \"Thanks for taking the message.\" Jeez! (Exits.)",
        "Hey, what’s up?",
        "But you’re still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today. (Shows him the paper.)",
        "Yeah? I just figured y’know, after living with you it’d be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y’know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who’s different than me. And what’s more different than me; a guy who’s not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? (Points to his head.) Not just a hat rack my friend!",
        "(exiting from Chandler’s room with the new roommate) Everything on your application looks really good—Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?",
        "Whoa!! Now look, don’t be just blurtin’ stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?",
        "Oh don’t listen to him, he’s just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don’t think he’s gonna get it.",
        "That thing was a hazard! (To the potential roommate) I’m very safety conscious.",
        "Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?",
        "Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you’re right where you don’t want to be! Back together!",
        "That’s not gonna work out! Then she’s gonna come home all weepy and you’ll be tellin’ her, \"Oh that’s okay. You’ll find someone.\" And then, bamn! She finds you!",
        "I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?",
        "Here she comes. Hold on, I’m gonna make your life much easier.",
        "Or not. Uh, Rach, why don’t you just move in with me? (Rachel sighs.)",
        "No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no… It’s okay, I mean I—look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday’s thing, but we don’t have to do that!",
        "Thursday’s clearly not good for ya, pick a day!",
        "(opening the door to The Potential Roommate) Hi!",
        "Come in. Thanks for comin’ back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!",
        "Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I’m gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.",
        "Okay! Here we go. Pillow.",
        "Very good! Okay. G.",
        "Excellent! Okay umm, doggy.",
        "Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, but—bye-bye! (He ushers her out the door.)",
        "Right! And when is that due?",
        "And that’s every month?",
        "Ahhh.",
        "(looking at it) Oh my God!!",
        "No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity…anymore.",
        "No! Forget it! Okay—I mean thanks, but I’m done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what’s next? Come on.",
        "This is how much we pay for electric?!!!",
        "Hey!",
        "I don’t know Ross, not if you’re gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.",
        "(quietly) I’ve got Ben.",
        "Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.",
        "Oh that’s okay. Hey, actually in a way it’s kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!",
        "What, are you crazy? You haven’t beaten me once since my injury plagued ’97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.",
        "Okay, you’re on.",
        "(scores) Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That’s like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! (Goes over to the fridge and starts opening and closing the door rapidly.) $500 that is a loooot of electricity! (By the way, there’s nothing in the fridge.) Whoo-ho-ho! (Notices the sparseness of the fridge.) I gotta buy some food.",
        "You serious?",
        "Okay, get ready to owe me!",
        "Okay, here we go. Ready?",
        "This sucks man! The last night you’re here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.",
        "Nah, not my game.",
        "Well, what’s it called?",
        "I don’t know how to play Cups.",
        "All right.",
        "A two and a five.",
        "Really?!",
        "A four and a nine.",
        "No. Why?",
        "Damn! I am good at Cups!",
        "Well, what did you have?",
        "Uh, (counts the money) wow, 700.",
        "Yeah.",
        "What?",
        "Really?",
        "Hey!",
        "Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!",
        "The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin’ Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn’t even get half a cup! Nothin’!!",
        "And he never played before either! Y’know what I think? I think beginner’s luck, very important in Cups.",
        "No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I’m serious this time! In-in fact, look, there’s a—I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. (He rolls the big white dog over) Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y’know, thank you for being such a great roommate.",
        "It’s him, not it!",
        "Wait a second, I see what you’re trying to do here! You-you’re trying to give me money again!",
        "Over there! (Points to the couch) Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said \"No,\" you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!",
        "I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can’t take care of myself. Okay? Look, I’m not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I’m gonna miss…is you. And now the dog.",
        "I can’t believe she would say that too you.",
        "(interrupting him) Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?",
        "Well, I’ve just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn’t have naked chicks on it.",
        "Oh-ooh-ooh! Y’know what’s a good visual aide?",
        "Why not?!",
        "Hey! Any good mail?",
        "Ooh, it’s probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I’m kinda….",
        "Hmm that’s weird. I don’t remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.",
        "Let me see that!",
        "(reads it) Oh, I can’t believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y’know? And it wouldn’t matter. Now I gotta be careful?!",
        "All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I’m gonna go see my agent.",
        "(mocks him, in a whiney voice) …look both ways before you cross the street. (Turns and walks headlong into the closed door.)",
        "(entering) Hey Estelle, listen…",
        "What are you talkin’ about? I never left you! You’ve always been my agent!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.",
        "Why?",
        "b*st*rd!",
        "(in obvious pain) Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I’ll have my health insurance back in no time.",
        "What?!",
        "Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since. But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious.",
        "No way! ‘Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! (Rolls over and shows Chandler.)",
        "Why did I have to start working out again? (Looks at the weights he was using.) Damn you 15s!",
        "Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it’s getting darker and more painful, that means it’s healing.",
        "Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don’t want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I’m thinking I’ll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.",
        "Hey!",
        "Look, I’m telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here (He puts his hand down his pants, like Al Bundy on Married…With Children always used to do.) it doesn’t hurt that bad.",
        "Sure, now I’m scared.",
        "Yeah, but I don’t wanna die!",
        "(in a gravely, painful voice) Okay. \"Hey, Timmy, I’ve got a surprise for you.\"",
        "Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I’ll just—hold on one second. (He turns around and puts his hand in his pants and groans in relief.) (In a relaxed voice.) \"Hey Timmy, I’ve got a surprise for you!\"",
        "So that’s why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today! (He turns, looks at the bag and realizes he won’t be able to pick it up.)",
        "Exactly.",
        "Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One, point to a bag today. (She just looks at him.) I didn’t get it, did I?",
        "Yeah, okay. (Leaves)",
        "Hi. I’m Joey Tribbiani; I’m here to audition for (Groans) man.",
        "Yes!",
        "(barely audible through the pain) Thank you.",
        "Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower.",
        "(to the director) Hiya!",
        "Hi Alex! (to the director) And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my pants. (Holds them both up.)",
        "\"Take could care of your Momma son.\" (Alex just looks at him and the director motions for him to continue so he tries it again.) \"Take could care of your Momma son.\" (Alex does nothing.) \"Come on son! Your Momma’s good people!\"",
        "Ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream right up until you say action?",
        "Okay. (Starts screaming.)",
        "(he stops screaming at action) \"Take good care of your Momma son.\" (Again Alex does nothing.)",
        "Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing. Now, don’t hold back. (He dons his protective helmet (Why, I have no clue.) and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)",
        "Hey-hey-hey!",
        "Hey.",
        "Sure, neighbor come on in.",
        "Uh, no, she’s at dance class.",
        "Yeah, but, hey look, don’t go through her stuff. She gets really mad.(Chandler gives him a look and walks to the door of his old room.)",
        "(Looking around the room.) It is???",
        "No.",
        "No.",
        "(With Big Eyes.) All right, you’re right. I’ll talk to her.",
        "I’m a man.",
        "(Grunting) Hmm. (Monica opens the front door and comes in.)",
        "Or maybe, it’s because you’re hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday. (Everybody gets up.)",
        "Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?",
        "Yeah, that’s what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh…Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It’s…too girly.",
        "Like this. (pointing to the picture) Pictures of cute babies we don’t know. We..we can’t have that.",
        "Look I don’t know this baby. I don’t know if she’s a famous artist or not. You know, and I don’t want to be a jerk but you’re changing too much around here.",
        "Yeah but it’s too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.",
        "I’m sure it’s a famous watering can, okay. But, come on…and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?",
        "Ohh, well, that’s ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It’s up here on some hook..and…smells different.",
        "Yeah, well, it feels different.",
        "Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towels…Also what is with these chips you bought?",
        "(Voice cracking) Well that’s like summer in a bowl.",
        "Hey Chandler. Come on in. We’re knitting pot holders.",
        "So what’s really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.",
        "Ohh, I love birds. (Monica leaves. Chandler shuts the door.)",
        "What?",
        "Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they’re just, you know, they’re nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.",
        "No I’m not. Why would you say that? That’s just mean.",
        "It’s not what you said. It’s the way you said it….Oh My God, I’m a women!!!",
        "Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.",
        "I’m sorry but we’ve got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That’s just the way it has to be.",
        "Great…Great…and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn’t want to make a big deal out of this, you know. (She starts to collect all the girlie stuff up.) You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.",
        "And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.",
        "And a couple of these little tiny boxes.",
        "(Smiling) Okay.",
        "Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate!",
        "Yeah, she's gonna live with me!",
        "I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!",
        "(shocked) From the land down under? I didn't know that either!",
        "You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer!",
        "Oh, hey let me. (Opens the door for Janine and after he closes the door behind her gasps ecstatically.)",
        "Of course I did.",
        "\"When can you move in?\"",
        "Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!",
        "Oh God, yeah.",
        "(happily) Okay!",
        "Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!",
        "Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.",
        "You a little sad about that sweetheart?",
        "(jumps out of the box) I Gotcha!!",
        "Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!",
        "(raises his hand) I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.",
        "Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. (Gives Chandler the \"Joey-love,\" look.) How you doin?",
        "(voice cracking) Ohhhh man",
        "No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too. (Starts to stretch, groans painfully)",
        "(jumps up and yells)",
        "Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower. (Goes into the bathroom and comes back out quickly) Oh my God!",
        "(entering) Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! (Tries to put his feet on the coffee table...they won't reach and looks around.) What the hell's going on over here?!?!? (Points to Chandler) Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.",
        "No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?",
        "This is great, this is great, what else, what else?",
        "Uh, don't you mean \"for whom?\"",
        "Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.",
        "All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.",
        "No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?",
        "Oh!",
        "Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.",
        "Oh, I do. (Gives her the Joey-love look.) How you doin?",
        "What?!?!",
        "Oh dear God!",
        "Hey!",
        "Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?",
        "Well all right then, I guess I shouldn’t get to excited about the fact (excitedly) that I just kissed her!",
        "Oh we kissed it up real nice.",
        "I came over here to tell you guys.",
        "Okay. (They kiss.)",
        "Okay. (They kiss.)",
        "Okay, I’m all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips? (She kisses him on the cheek and starts to leave.)",
        "Have you kissed her yet? It’s awesome! I could do it forever! Y’know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!",
        "I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!",
        "(indignant) I was tired!",
        "Hey! I made that for her!",
        "Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.",
        "And Chandler I can’t believe I let you pay for this one. (They hug and he whispers in his ear.) Thanks man.",
        "Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.",
        "Nope-op! I insist! (He hugs Chandler again and whispers to him.) You get the wine right?",
        "See ya tomorrow!",
        "What?",
        "What-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler?",
        "Blah?!",
        "Uh, they’re like my best friends. Are you saying we can’t hang out with them? ‘Cause that would kinda be a problem.",
        "I guess.",
        "If you want, I’ll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.",
        "Hi!",
        "Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it’s just gonna be me again tonight.",
        "Oh, she’s uh-uh really sick.",
        "Yeah, she’s been in there all day (Points to her room), uh high fever, a nose problem… Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!",
        "‘Kay!",
        "No-no, she really is sick!",
        "Uh, y’know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.",
        "Well uh, she didn’t want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I’m so sorry.",
        "Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.",
        "I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don’t-don’t be mad. I’m sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y’know? And it was our first date! Plus, she’s really sick!",
        "I know, but don’t you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?",
        "Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She’ll come around I promise.",
        "(shouting) I can hear you!",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "So uh, what are you guys doing?",
        "Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.",
        "Ha-ha, very funny—Look! I don’t know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!",
        "That’s right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!",
        "You don’t think I know that!",
        "Well, this-this-this was great. Didn’t everybody have a great time?",
        "Oh well then, good night!",
        "See? Eh, wasn’t that fun?",
        "All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! (To Chandler and Monica) You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine! (They start to leave.)",
        "All right, uh, we’ve got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can’t treat them that way.",
        "I know! I know! And I’m going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They… They’re like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I… I don’t think we can be together. It just, it just can’t work. It can’t. (Starts to break up) I’m very upset.",
        "Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah. (He opens the door for her and she exits into the hallway.)",
        "Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?",
        "Yeah! (They head downstairs.)",
        "How ya doin’?",
        "Pretty much, yeah.",
        "Well, when it’s not right, you know it.",
        "Yeah! Yeah. I’ll be all right.",
        "What?",
        "(laughing hysterically) You’re right! That did cheer me up!",
        "Hey you guys.",
        "I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y’know, everywhere I look she’s like… (He imitates her stretching)",
        "I like her so much!",
        "I know. And she’s so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.",
        "Totally! I would love to spend New Year’s with you.",
        "Did she just ask me out on a date?",
        "Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We’re going to a New Year’s Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y’know? But if she says ‘Dude, what the hell are you doing?’ I can say ‘It wasn’t me, it was New Years!’",
        "OK, listen I’ve been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It’s a show, but we’re just dancing, OK? It’s no big deal. The important thing to remember – stay cool.",
        "Ross! So when is it gonna air?",
        "Really?",
        "What do you mean?",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "No-no-no-no-no we came together!",
        "No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.",
        "Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. (The girl starts dancing really close to him, so he picks her up, twirls her round, and puts her against a platform) Here we go. (He walks away to find Monica and Ross doing a really out of place dance) Looking good Gellers!",
        "Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you’re dancing with.",
        "Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown – I’m trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..",
        "Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she’s real, uh, mellow!",
        "Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know…",
        "Alright, alright, hey y’know fair is fair, (he pretends to wash his hands) if you’re right, you’re right, what can I say, but hey oh no! (He throws water on the guy’s pants)",
        "Hey, now you’re the one who wet his pants. (He throws another handful on him and runs out)",
        "Uh, take a look at the guy’s pants! I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don’t you think he went a little overboard?",
        "Yeah, take a hike wetpants!",
        "No! Year! Happy No Year!",
        "Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how the New Year’s gonna go off. I guess there’s no reason for all that Y2K panic, y’know? Anyway, g’night!",
        "Yeah?",
        "Oh, yoii. What was that for?",
        "Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.",
        "But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?",
        "No.",
        "3, 2,",
        "Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.",
        "Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin’ up, eh?",
        "Well maybe I love ya’.",
        "Yeah! Yeah, why? What’s up?",
        "Ye-ye, we go to yours!",
        "How you got three women to marry you, I’ll never know.",
        "Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!",
        "Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!",
        "Well, this has been great!",
        "Uh, some of her friends, yeah.",
        "(frustrated) Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they’re gonna be, be drinkin’ and dancin, and we really wanna go!",
        "Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!",
        "Rach, you’re killin’ us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!",
        "Y-sure!",
        "I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?",
        "(turning to Chandler in a scolding tone) Chandler!",
        "(sad) Oh man! Now she’s gonna start all over! We’re never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!",
        "Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?",
        "(shrugging his shoulders to go along with it) Vomiting stories are funny...",
        "Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?",
        "(frustrated) Still not hot enough!",
        "(to Rachel) Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine’s friends are dancers?! And that they’re going to be drinking alot!?",
        "Well you’re whippin’ so slow! Can’t you do it any faster?",
        "Oh I am!",
        "Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?",
        "Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.",
        "Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they’re all gonna’ make fun of her, do you want that?",
        "(scolding) Dude, they’re not objects.",
        "Just kiddin,’ I’ll talk to them, you distract Rach.",
        "Oh and (Ross begins to open the door and Joey says some gibberish word to indicate to Ross that he’s not done yet. Ross closes the door again.) Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach (Rubs his stomach) or uh, or saying “mmm” and uh, oh oh! And smiling (Smiles while pretending to stir a bowl), okay?",
        "Rachel, there you are! Come on, let’s serve that dessert already!",
        "(happily) Really?",
        "I like it.",
        "What’s not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.",
        "(pounding the table) I wanna gooooooo!",
        "No it isn’t, I ate that.",
        "Nope, got it and I got yours (Pointing to Jack) too.",
        "(entering) Hey guys.",
        "Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?",
        "Let’s go watch it at your place.",
        "Chandler, Chandler, y’know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.",
        "No, that’s VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It’s like a lotta noise to me. I don’t know…",
        "I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven’t really paid the bill",
        "No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.",
        "I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book (holds up the Playboy magazine).",
        "Sure.",
        "Not so much.",
        "You forget how many great songs Heart had.",
        "Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.",
        "Ah, Gunther, I can’t pay for this right now because I’m not working, so I’ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin’ for stuff.",
        "Uh, I don’t know. Ya see, it’s just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y’know? And to go from that to this, I just… Plus, I’d have to wait on all my friends.",
        "What?!",
        "Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?",
        "(sheepishly) I finished my book. (Chandler and Monica slowly retreat back to bed.)",
        "Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, ‘cause I’m heading up there.",
        "Sure. (To Monica and Rachel) Coffee? ‘Cause I’m going up there.",
        "(to a table of strangers) You guys need anything, ‘cause I’m heading up there.",
        "You got it.",
        "Just being friendly. (He gives Monica a ‘what’s wrong with you?’ look and proceeds to walk behind the counter.)",
        "Nah, it’s okay. Right, Gunther? (Winks at him as if they’re in on a secret together.)",
        "Okay, but I don’t see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.",
        "No.",
        "Yeah?",
        "It’s kind of embarrassing, y’know. I mean, I was an actor and now I’m a waiter. It’s supposed to go in the other direction.",
        "I mean, the job’s easy and the money’s good, you know? I guess I’m going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.",
        "Okay, I guess it doesn’t seem that weird.",
        "See, now it’s weird again.",
        "Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y’know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It’s all about turnover.",
        "Oh, I’m sorry, Ross. I’ll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I’ll toss in a free muffin.",
        "Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.",
        "Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it’s a great part. Look, check it out. I’m the lead guy’s best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. ‘I’m sorry, that seat’s saved.’",
        "Okay, maybe he’s not his best friend, but …",
        "Oh, man, I could totally get that part. ‘I’m sorry, that seat is taken.’",
        "No, no, I didn’t mean you. But, you believed me, huh?",
        "So, you’d hire me, right?",
        "Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.",
        "Yeah, it’s for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It’s a very important issue in this month’s Playboy. I’m sure you all read about it.",
        "Not good, no. I didn’t get the part, and I lost my job here, so …",
        "Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.",
        "Yeah, what are ya gonna do?",
        "That’s great. Thanks Rach.",
        "I’m not answering that.",
        "(nodding knowingly) Now you’re thinking you gotta sleep with him.",
        "Me too.",
        "Oh man! (Hits Chandler)",
        "Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!",
        "I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin’ up about something… Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he’s just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi b*st*rd, I’ll…",
        "Hey! So I’m back.",
        "Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! (The dry cleaner doesn’t remember) Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? (Holds his picture up in front of his face.) Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I’m ready to go back up on the wall I’m the star of a new TV show.",
        "Oh well, it’s not on TV yet.",
        "Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh? (Walks away)",
        "(entering) Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?",
        "All right, let’s get me back up there! (Holds out his picture.)",
        "What—But you saw the show!",
        "Dry cleaners?",
        "Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!",
        "Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that’s offensive to Russians.",
        "Oh you should, it’s great.",
        "Uh yeah, where-where’s the guy who decides who’s pictures go up on the wall?",
        "Oh, you’re kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I’m an actor; I’m kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.",
        "Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? (Pause) You’re the other one right? (She thinks about it for a second and nods yes.)",
        "I didn’t do that! Who would’ve done that?!",
        "Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I—Hey! I did not go out with your wife! (The same woman from before enters.) Okay? I went out with her! (Points at her.)",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hey Gunther.",
        "Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.",
        "No! No, I quit a long time ago. (Pause) Did I forget to you that one? I’m sorry.",
        "Great! (Takes his coffee and leaves.)",
        "Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?",
        "Oh, ‘cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there’s your admirer. (Ross is stunned.)",
        "Oh, well think of it like this, when you’re 90…",
        "No that’s not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you’re 90 you’ll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.",
        "Hey Chandler! Y’know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?",
        "Oh well listen, anyway she’s directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!",
        "No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!",
        "Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?",
        "All right! Thanks! You’re the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?",
        "(angrily) Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!",
        "Okay.",
        "The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!",
        "(to the fireman) Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?",
        "Oh, how bad is it?",
        "Chandler, is that… (Mimes someone using a movie camera and Chandler nods yes.)",
        "Hey-hey listen… (Chandler waves him away.)",
        "When you’re off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?",
        "Hey listen, so when’s-when’s my audition? I mean I know it’s Thursday, but what time?",
        "Ah-ha!",
        "Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey. (He turns around to see Chandler glaring at him.)",
        "This right here is where I keep the pizza. (He points to the chair.) And uh that’s where the napkin is. (Points to the floor next to the chair.)",
        "I know! (Shrugs his shoulders.)",
        "This is where I keep the pizza. (It’s the same location as before.) And—Hey! Where did the napkin go?! (The napkin is not in it’s spot.)",
        "(in a funny voice) Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn’t the hair straightener that started the fire. (Rachel prompts him on what to say next.) No-no, it was the candles. It’s very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is… (Phoebe suddenly enters.) Uhh… Uhh… Okay. Well, I have to go now. (Phoebe leaves.)",
        "Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what’s more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.",
        "Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?",
        "You couldn’t do it?!",
        "Ah whatever!",
        "No that’s all right. Don’t worry about it.",
        "Rach! Hey! It’s fine! You’re at Joey’s!",
        "Yeah! Look! (He throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.)",
        "I know.",
        "All right, don’t waste it, I mean its still food. (He picks it up and eats it.)",
        "Hey, here you go. (Hands her another one.)",
        "Oh, very funny. I don’t know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday. (Chandler doesn’t say anything until Joey figures it out.) You got me the audition?! Let’s hug it up! (They hug.)",
        "That’s right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey’s.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hey!",
        "So?",
        "Wh? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when huh what? Thurs—(He gasps in horror.) Oh! (Runs out and Chandler just shakes his head. After a second Joey runs back in to grab a piece of pizza and runs back out.)",
        "Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together that’s (pauses to figure the total) $12.75.",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh that’s on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.",
        "Well, he’s not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with him—He says it’s okay. (She hands him her card.) Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!",
        "It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I’m getting more dates than ever!",
        "How about a scone on the house baby?",
        "Hey, (in the Joey voice) how you doin’?",
        "(to a customer) Are you all finished here?",
        "Great! (Joey takes his cookie and finishes it.)",
        "What?!",
        "Well if it’s free food, how come you’re charging me for it?",
        "Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?",
        "(to a woman who came in third in a modeling contest) Sorry! (He grabs her muffin away and returns it to the serving tray.)",
        "That’ll be $3.85.",
        "It’s just I can’t because my manager said I… (Gets an idea) (Starts singing) \"Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Annie…",
        "(still singing) \"…Amy! Happy birthday to you!\"",
        "Yeah, not it here it isn’t.",
        "(singing) \"Happy birthday to you!\"",
        "What? No-no it’s her birthday!",
        "But it really…",
        "Damnit! (Storms off.)",
        "(overhearing them) Oh-ho, and mine!",
        "(To Ross) What is the matter with you?!",
        "Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. (To Rachel) Who-who’s Barry and Mindy?",
        "Ohh-oh, wasn’t he cheating on you with her?",
        "(starts to imagine it) I can’t. I keep seeing it the good way.",
        "Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! (Closes his eyes to do so.) Oh-hey, there’s Carol again!",
        "So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?",
        "(not impressed) Wow!!",
        "Oh dear God, let me think. (Starts to sarcastically think about it.)",
        "Hey.",
        "Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?",
        "Really?",
        "That’s an idea! (To Chandler) Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?",
        "That’s great! That would be great! Let’s do that!",
        "Oh right great! Welcome aboard!",
        "All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don’t need any assistance in there, take a break!",
        "(holding a plate of what looks like Rice Crispies Treats) I know, here-here!! (Hands her the plate.)",
        "(shaking Rachel’s hand) Hi!",
        "Well, it’s always nice to meet the fans.",
        "(turning and whispering to Monica) She’s not crazy is she?",
        "(To Rachel) So uh, how you doin’?",
        "(entering) Hey there you are!",
        "All right, here’s a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I’m delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine! (Exits.)",
        "(entering) Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?",
        "Oh great. (Starts to go in.) (To Chandler) Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!",
        "All right, and over there is Brady’s Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.",
        "Well, that is a large piece of television equipment. (Points at a large piece of television equipment as an old man walks by.) And uh that is an old man! Hey old man!",
        "All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?",
        "Why? (In Drake’s voice.) Why can’t the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?",
        "Uh, yeah but uh, (In Drake’s voice) I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.",
        "Okay, you watch too much TV.",
        "Thanks! (Looks at it.) Yeah, there’s pulp in that. (Hands it back.)",
        "I thought we talked about this. I don’t like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn’t juice. All juice, okay?",
        "Oh my God, I’m sorry, I’m being so rude. (Turns to Rachel.) Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.",
        "(To Chandler) Iced tea.",
        "(To Rachel) Did I not just tell him?",
        "(To Chandler) Okay look, Chandler, if this (Motions back and forth indicating the arrangement.) you have got to listen! (Tugs on his ear.) (Chandler glares at him.) You’re gonna throw that juice at me, aren’t ya?",
        "(entering) Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know you’re mad, but I just want to say I’m sorry. I-I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! Y’know? I mean, y’know how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?",
        "Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say I’m sorry. Here. (Hands him a cup.)",
        "Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it.",
        "Oh my God! That’s great! Congratulations! What’s the story?!",
        "Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!",
        "Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? ‘Cause I think I read it!",
        "I know. (Joey is sitting in this tall chair that is made up of balls on polls. You’ll have to see it to know what I mean.) Yeah, his name is Pat.",
        "(climbing down from his chair) Do you uh, do you—ready for a refill?",
        "Pretty cool, huh? But if you’re thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn’t get sucked up into the mechanism, well you’d be wrong.",
        "It’s uh, right through there. (Points.)",
        "Yeah, life’s pretty great isn’t it?",
        "Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.",
        "Yeah you did.",
        "Here you go. Let me ask you a question.",
        "When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?",
        "Come, come here.",
        "(entering) Morning!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well he actually saw you a little bit too.",
        "No! No! No, not after seeing that.",
        "Wh-why?",
        "That’s ridiculous! I’m not a \"Star,\" just a regular famous actor.",
        "Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me…",
        "Wow! Uh okay, well uh… (He gets up, opens a drawer, and pulls out the ring.)",
        "Sure! As long as they don’t find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.",
        "Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you’ve had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn’t. And that’s what this ring stands for.",
        "Look, do you want the ring or not?!",
        "Hey!",
        "All right!",
        "Whoa-whoa-whoa! You’re not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are ya?",
        "(not quite sure of how to answer that) Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carol’s great and I’m sure you’re a very attractive man, but I….",
        "You?",
        "Wow!",
        "All right! So, was it amazing?",
        "Just okay—Did you do it right?!",
        "Huh. But still Ross, you’re worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y’know what I mean?",
        "But you got to be with both of them, right?",
        "Not the other one?",
        "Yeah, you don’t want that.",
        "Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?",
        "You got a little bored?",
        "Yeah? What did ya have?",
        "Sounds good.",
        "Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! (He grabs a screwdriver and starts to attack the compressor, only he causes a small short circuit and shocks himself.) Ah-ah!! Damn fridge!",
        "Great! Roomie!",
        "Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.",
        "Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya’?",
        "All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, I’ll take a check for the other hundred.",
        "Of course I’m jokin’! I don’t take checks.",
        "Oh, I’m sorry. Thank you Chandler.",
        "Ooh! So close.",
        "Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how’s it going with her?",
        "Huh.",
        "The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes—Hey, what was in that brown jar?",
        "Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?",
        "No! No! No! For my new fridge—our new fridge!",
        "So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.",
        "And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.",
        "(pause) Give me $400!",
        "Or! You can just, y’know… (He walks up close to whisper in Ross’s ear and when he gets there he pushes Ross into the fridge.)",
        "What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!",
        "Oh-ho-ho, you think I don’t know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me! (He opens the door and feels inside.) Well what do you know! Broken! That’ll be $400!",
        "(pause) You pushed him!",
        "All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?",
        "I still haven’t gotten a check for your half yet.",
        "I’m not talking to you! You broke my fridge!",
        "(entering) Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!",
        "Really?!",
        "Call it even?",
        "Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?",
        "Sure! I was there! Spring Break ’81! Woo-hoo!",
        "So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y’know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV.",
        "Ahh, to be 13 again.",
        "(he’s just picked up their bill) Hey! So, what’s with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?",
        "Y’know what’s more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Y’know what’s even more generous than that?!!",
        "All right, look I’m sorry you guys, but it’s just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they’re really expensive, y’know? I’m down to like three! Well, actually two ‘cause one of ‘em I kinda blackened in some teeth—Why did I do that?! (Hits himself in the head.)",
        "Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!",
        "No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? Let’s see uh, well I don’t want to donate sperm again. (To Ross) I really prefer doing that at the home office y’know? (Ross nods his head.) Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Uhh do it?",
        "Well, where was I? (Takes a sip of the coffee.)",
        "Takes it out of you? (Laughs.)",
        "Ohh, hey! Why don’t you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?",
        "And of course, crotchless panties.",
        "You can’t make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut…",
        "(to the receptionist) Hi uh, I’m Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect I’d like to donate some fluids.",
        "Oh that’s too bad. I’ve kinda been saving up. (She just looks at him in horror.) Uh, are you sure there’s no studies I can participate in?",
        "Thanks. (Starts to read it.) Well but this one starts now. (Points to one.)",
        "But it’s $2,000.",
        "Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.",
        "(in his head) 2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me? (The camera widens its shot to reveal a room full of Joey look-a-likes. Joey looks at the guy next to him and then back at his script.)",
        "(entering) No! No! No! No! No! How you doin’?! How you doin’—Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall! (Goes into the hall.)",
        "Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.",
        "Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.",
        "Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y’know? The only problem is, Carl’s acting is… (Does the international hand symbol for so-so.)",
        "Yeah, he’s the reason I didn’t get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up.",
        "(to Carl) Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!! (Carl does so.)",
        "All right Carl, we’re next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?",
        "That’s right! And what are you not gonna do?",
        "(gets very angry) Damnit Carl! (Carl goes to say something more, and Joey silences him with a grunt.)",
        "That’s us.",
        "That’s right, $2,000.",
        "Damnit Carl!",
        "Hey. (Heads straight for the fridge.)",
        "Oh, I’m sorry. You wanna bite? (Holds his piece out for him.)",
        "No.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, we’re supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!",
        "Oh wow that’s a great idea! And I still have his credit card.",
        "Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go. (Hands Gunther Chandler’s card.) Y’know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just—I don’t get Chandler. Y’know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don’t get all upset.",
        "All the time!",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Whoa-whoa-hey-hey! (Motions to Chandler, \"What’s going on?\") Hi, Paul is it? (Paul nods yes and still hugging Joey.)",
        "Yes, it’s in my… In…in my pocket. (Paul hasn’t dropped him yet.) (Chandler starts to reach for his front pocket.) My back pocket! My back pocket!",
        "Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.",
        "Come on! It’ll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and… Paul probably…",
        "No! He blew us off!",
        "I know!",
        "Can I tell you something? Me too.",
        "Ooooh! Freeze him out.",
        "I like it!",
        "From now on, it’s gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends. (They shake hands.) Okay! We’re gonna be the new Joey and Chandler.",
        "(To Ross) I think we gotta end the freeze out.",
        "Oh my God!!",
        "And-and-and-and-and-and, and we’re gonna be friends again!",
        "Oh it’s water under the bridge, forget it!",
        "I think I’m gonna cry!",
        "(holding an empty tissue box) Where’s all the tissues?! (Throws the box down in disgust.)",
        "The reactor’s gonna blow in three seconds, we’re never gonna make it!",
        "No! I won’t leave you!",
        "No you’re not! Not to me!",
        "What?",
        "Yeah, you’re great! Okay, let’s take it from…",
        "Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too.",
        "Y’know what? I think that’s enough for now. Yeah. I don’t want to be over rehearsed.",
        "Oh, it’s a new TV show. Yeah. I’m up for the part of Mac Macaveli or \"Mac.\" Yeah, I’m a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. He’s a, he’s a Computerized Humanoid Electronically Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or \"C.H.E.E.S.E.\"",
        "That’s the title! Yeah! Y’know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.",
        "Well, don’t get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.",
        "I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don’t know if I’m good enough.",
        "You really think so?",
        " Yeah, and oh she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.",
        " It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. (Does this intense look where it looks like he's smelling a fart.)",
        "(there's a gunshot on TV) There's my scene, there's my scene. [Joey on tv] \"Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.  I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a...\" (Does the smell-the-fart look.)",
        "(on stage in an Austrian accent) Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. (He goes into a song and dance number.)",
        " I play Al Pacino's butt. All right? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.",
        " C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!",
        "Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!",
        "All right well, I’m outta here. Wish me luck.",
        "Yeah, whatever. (Exits.)",
        "(entering, dejectedly) Hey.",
        "Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn’t even be an actor!",
        "Yeah, did I fool ya?",
        "Oh, it went amazingly well!",
        "Yeah-yeah, it’s down to me and two other guys.",
        "And I know both of them, they’re really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who’s always getting chased by those big flowers…",
        "I’m just so nervous! Y’know? The callback isn’t until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!",
        "There’s just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don’t know if you’d understand.",
        "I want this part so much! Y’know? If I don’t get this part I’m never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again!—No, I didn’t say that! That’s a lie.",
        "Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?",
        "(on phone) Hello? (Listens) What are you talking about? The audition’s not ‘til 5:00! (Chandler suddenly remembers and looks at the unfinished message then tries to sneak over and finish it as Joey listens.) Well, nobody told me! (Listens) Who’d you talk to? (Listens and turns around to see Chandler trying to finish the message.) Nevermind! (Hangs up.)",
        "The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!",
        "How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could’ve turned my whole career around!",
        "Hey, you don’t even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!",
        " And what?! Did you sleep with her?!",
        " What?!! That’s even worse!!",
        " I don’t know! But it’s the same!",
        " Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line, that you-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!",
        "Name one!",
        "(getting out) Awww, man! He promised he wouldn’t take the chairs!!",
        " Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn’t think big enough to fit a grown man!",
        " I was tryin’ to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I’m gonna do?",
        "No way!  I've been going to the guy for 12 years.",
        "That's how they do pants!  Ross, will you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?",
        "I said name one!",
        "Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.",
        "Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...",
        "Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges. (starts doing lunges)",
        "Hey!",
        "What message?",
        "What?! It’s 6 o’clock!",
        "I can’t believe this Chandler!",
        "Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!",
        "Oh, well I’m uh…",
        "Oh wow! Okay man, I’m sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.",
        "(shocked) That’s mean! You really had me going there!",
        "Yeah, you’re right. Okay look, listen, let’s talk about what a huge star I’m gonna be!",
        "You hug me!",
        "Hey, do we do this too much?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I’m not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU.",
        "Wow! (Back to reading the scene.) Well then I’ll just have to carry you.",
        "Ross, you don’t have to yell.",
        "Y’know what? I think that’s enough for today. Thanks for your help! (He grabs their scripts and heads for his room.)",
        "(entering) Hey guys!",
        "Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I’ve dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!",
        "But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don’t know anything about technology! I can’t even use Chandler’s computer except to find p0rn! And-and that’s only ‘cause it’s right there when you turn it on!",
        "Wow! Huh? (Picks up the phone) Mac Macaveli, Private Investigator!",
        "Okay. Hey uh, when do I get to meet the robot?",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh wow! He’s so lifelike! (Starts touching the guy’s cheeks) Unbelievable! (He starts tugging on the guy’s ears.",
        "(slaps Wayne on his cheek) How do you do there, Wayne? (Backs away.)",
        "Okay. Sorry about that…(Mimics that cheek thing he just did.) Uh, so where’s C.H.E.E.S.E.?",
        "(laughs) This is like the temporary robot, right?",
        "Well, I-I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot, y’know? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you.",
        "I’m sorry, it just—I don’t know it doesn’t really look like it can do anything.",
        "Hey!",
        "Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.",
        "Anyway, it wasn’t the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn’t like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!",
        "I may have to, I hate to do it, but I’m the star! Y’know? There’s a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. (His cell phone rings) Excuse me. (Answers it, on phone) Joey Tribbiani.",
        "Wow!",
        "I’m the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!",
        "Apparently, there’s like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there’s only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn’t know he could get me fired! What am I going to do?",
        "Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.",
        "That’s not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I’m not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. (Starts to leave, but stops and turns to Phoebe.) Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs. (Exits.)",
        "Morning! Hey, how’s my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?! (Pats C.H.E.E.S.E. on the head.)",
        "Okay! (He yanks his hand away.) All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! (He grabs C.H.E.E.S.E.’s arm and pulls it off at the elbow.) Ah-ah!! (Wayne is shocked.) Okay, that’s why you didn’t want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? (Hands Wayne the arm and he goes to fix it. Meanwhile Joey starts to berate himself.) Stupid! I can’t believe it! God! (A very beautiful woman walks by.) (To her) Hey, how you doin’? (He and her go over to talk and Wayne looks on with envy.)",
        "I can’t believe I’m going to lose this job!",
        "Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.",
        "Yeah? Well, I don’t want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler. (They shake hands.)",
        "(incredulous) Why should I help you?!",
        "(happily) What do you need?",
        "Yeah?",
        "What are you in love with her or something?",
        "Oh wow Wayne, it’s not really something you can teach y’know? It’s pretty much something you’re born with if you—(Off Chandler’s look)—You-you can teach it! I’ll show you right how to do it.",
        "Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.",
        "You got it! And the rabbi’s beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch C.H.E.E.S.E.! (Pauses as he waits for C.H.E.E.S.E.’s next line.) It’s your line C.H.E.E.S.E.! (Suddenly C.H.E.E.S.E. goes crazy and starts flinging it’s arms and advancing on Joey behind the desk.) Wayne! Wayne!!",
        "Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her?",
        "That sounds perfect!",
        "You’re gonna mess it up let me do it.",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey Rach!",
        "Where are you going?",
        "Hey, y’know what? I’ll come too. I’m making money now; it’s about time I give something back.",
        "Okay. Have a benefit.",
        "That’s not what she said last night. (Ross glares at him.)",
        "It’s the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!",
        "(behind them) Oh!! Shrimp toast! (Walks right past the little group on his way for the shrimp toast.)",
        "Hey!",
        "I won! That was my guess!",
        "I guessed 20,000!",
        "What?! I don’t have 20,000!",
        "I didn’t know it was an auction!",
        "I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!",
        "I don’t know! Charity?",
        "Oh hi!",
        "Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?",
        "(To Rachel) Hey, I was pretty close. (She just glares at him.) Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can’t buy the boat, I don’t have any money.",
        "So uh listen, I think I’m gonna take off now. (Starts to get up.)",
        "Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don’t have that kind of money!",
        "Okay.",
        "Look, I don’t know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y’know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!",
        "Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.",
        "(To Phoebe) Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.",
        "Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?",
        "Ahh, yes. (Pushes Rachel in front of himself so that she could do the talking.)",
        "You-you have to pay that! It’s not just a guess.",
        "Are you kidding me?! She’s gonna this boat!",
        "Aw-awww!",
        "Oooooh…",
        "No way! It’s mine!!",
        "All that stuff you just said? I want that!",
        "Who cares?! I-I’ll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr. Bowmont!!",
        "Oh my God, you’re back!",
        "Yeah.",
        "What?! Noooo… (Phoebe gasps.)",
        "We didn’t ruin it!",
        "Glove salesman!",
        "Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off! (They give each other fives.)",
        "That guy’s still doing that?!",
        "Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. (They both squint at each other.) I never noticed that before.",
        "Hey!",
        "(laughs) Yeah, Big Brother.",
        "(all excited) The Mr. Bowmont’s here!!! (Jumps over the back off the couch and runs out into the street.)",
        "Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?",
        "Hey Monica!",
        "This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?",
        "Whoa-whoa, what’s the matter?! Talk to the captain!",
        "Chandler giving you a hard time huh?",
        "Well, you know Chandler.",
        "Maybe you changed?",
        "Maybe that’s the problem.",
        "Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.",
        "I don’t know! (All excited) I haven’t totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.",
        "Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!",
        "There are?",
        "R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! (Monica nods yes.) And-and Chandler’s tellin’ ya how much he hates marriage?!",
        "Chandler loves marriage!!",
        "You got that from what I said?!",
        "Where the hell have you been?!",
        "Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!",
        "Yeah! Yeah, I’ve been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these (lifts a leg) damn boat shoes wouldn’t keep flying off!",
        "I know! They suck!!",
        "I know!",
        "Look, Chandler I don’t think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Okay.",
        "Dude-dude-dude!",
        "Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Phoebe! We’re both (points at Ross and himself) your backup?!",
        "No we weren’t!",
        "Pick me!!",
        "This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!",
        "Okay that’s fair.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Dude!",
        "She’s gone.",
        "She’s gone. She had a bag and she left.",
        "She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.",
        "I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn’t believe me.",
        "To her parent’s I think and she said you shouldn’t call her. But if I were you I would.",
        "I am so sorry man.",
        "(yelling through the door) Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here!",
        "Yeah!",
        "(grabbing the candy bar) Yeah I’ll take that.",
        "Yeah, she’s been out there for twenty minutes, I’m surprised you didn’t hear her on the way over.",
        "But I-I-I can’t stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I’m supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. (Everyone stops in their tracks upon hearing this.) What?",
        "You guys don’t think I look 19?",
        "(To Phoebe) Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?",
        "I was afraid of that.",
        "‘Sup? ‘Sup dude?",
        "So you’re playing a little Playstation, huh? That’s whack! Playstation is whack! ‘Sup with the whack Playstation, ‘sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!",
        "Come on man, really how old?!",
        "Wow thanks! (He goes into his bedroom and closes the door.)",
        "Yeah!",
        "When? Today? Some, not a lot.",
        "Don’t worry about that man, that happens.",
        "Yeah! Once.",
        "I did it anyway.",
        "Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!",
        "What?",
        "You guys kissed! Oh my—this is huge!",
        "Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.",
        "You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!",
        "Really?",
        "Seriously?",
        "(gasps) I’m 30!",
        "(realizes) Aww crap!",
        "Psss, that is whack!",
        "Yeah! Well, I think we’ll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, \"You look 19,\" and then they just take it away like-like, \"No you don’t.\"",
        "Wouldn’t she?",
        "Would she? (He smells something and gasps as he realizes what it is.) You ate my candy bar!",
        "They break your heart, don’t they?",
        "Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!",
        "What?! What’s wrong with my eyes.",
        "And that’ll get rid of my wisdom?",
        "Hey!",
        "Who wants French toast?",
        "Good, me too. (Tosses him the loaf.) Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.",
        "(sitting up from the couch) Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? (Holds up one.) Y’know, something a little snugglyer?",
        "Well, the duck…",
        "Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!",
        "(sitting up again) Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I’m gonna get cranky!",
        "Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!",
        "All right, I’m gonna go! (Gets up and heads for the door.)",
        "I don’t know! But he did not eat your face cream!",
        "Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? (The duck does not get sick and Joey recoils in horror and heads for the couch.) What the hell is in that face cream? (He’s about to try out the couch but notices the bed in Rachel’s room. He walks into her room and feels the bed.) That’s so soft. (He pulls back the comforter.) Pillowcases! (He climbs in and groans in delight. Suddenly, he feels something under him and pulls out a little beat up paperback book. He opens it and starts to read from it.) (In his head.) Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar…(Stops reading and thinks.) The vicar? (Continues reading) …wouldn’t be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his…(Out loud.) Whoa! (Reads on in silence.) Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book! (Continues to read.)",
        "Sweepin’. Why? Turn you on?",
        "Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?",
        "Where are you going? The vicar won’t be home for hours.",
        "Where do you think, (pause) Zelda?",
        "Yeah I did!",
        "Okay, look I’m sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn’t have, but you got p0rn!",
        "You got p0rn!",
        "Hey Rach.",
        "Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?",
        "No-no-no, I’m serious. You don’t smell it? Something’s on fire.",
        "Oh, y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins.",
        "Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?",
        "Gotcha.",
        "Hello, Zelda.",
        "The vicar!",
        "Like a goalie, right?",
        "All right, I’m sorry. Rach I—Rach I’m sorry. Okay? I’m sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn. (Giggles.)",
        "Huh?",
        "(nervously backing away) I-I-I-I did? (He puts a stool in front of her.)",
        "This body? (He backs into the kitchen.)",
        "Hey-hey, you’re startin’ to sound like the butcher’s wife there in-in chapter seven.",
        "I don’t want to, I’m scared.",
        "(laughing and turning off the TV) So, what did you guys think?",
        "(on phone) Mom, so what did you think? (He walks away allowing the gang a chance to figure out what they’re gonna say.)",
        "(hangs up the phone) Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did you guys think? (Phoebe smiles, walks up to him, and presses her breasts against him.) It wasn’t that good.",
        "(entering from bathrooms excitedly) You guys! You guys! You’re not gonna believe what my agent just told me!",
        "Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go.",
        "I’m gonna be on two TV shows!",
        "Oh, you weren’t finished?",
        "Uh Rach, if you’re gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine.",
        "(groans in disgust) Wow, it’s really long.",
        "Well, these really are the days of our lives.",
        "Well, since you ask. They want me back on Days of Our Lives!",
        "I’ll be playing Drake Ramoray’s twin brother, Stryker!",
        "(jumps up) Well—I got a head rush from standing up too fast right there.",
        "Hey Terry!",
        "It’s been a while, huh? Wow, it’s funny these halls look smaller than they used to.",
        "So! Stryker Ramoray huh? When do you want me to start?",
        "Okay.",
        "(looking between the pages and him) Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.",
        "Well, I was Dr. Drake Ramoray, Stryker’s twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?",
        "Y’know Terry, I-I don’t really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, (Pause) with a robot.",
        "Well. I guess you think you’re pretty special huh? Sittin’ up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin’ stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y’know what? (Throws the script away) This is one star who’s hoop… This is a star that the hoop—this hoop—I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!",
        "Hey.",
        "Was she happy you gave her the job?",
        "(on phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? (To Phoebe and Rachel) It’s the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me for a minute? (On phone) Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next week’s script. (Listens) Canceled?! (Listens) Like they’re taking it off the air? (Listens) Ohh. (Listens) All right, see you Monday. (Listens) We’re not even shootin’ them anymore?!! (Listens) All right, bye! (Hangs up) They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!",
        "Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!",
        "How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin’!",
        "Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.",
        "Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.",
        "Because they wanted me to audition!",
        "Hey! Terry.",
        "Wait! Terry! Wait—Look—Wait I-I… Look, I’m really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I’m too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance.",
        "Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake.",
        "(jumping up and removing the bandages) I’m back baby! Ha-ha-ha!",
        "What?",
        "Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler’s eyes!",
        "Feminine.",
        "(entering) Ahoy!",
        "Great! I’m finally getting into this sailing stuff.",
        "Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!",
        "Oh, it’s great! It’s a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips. (He says that as he sits, hangs around, drinks a beer, and eats a chip.)",
        "You could?",
        "(drinking a beer) Look at this clown! Just because he’s got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. (Yelling) Get out of the way jackass! (To Rachel) Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?",
        "What are they doing out here? The coast’s all the way over there. (Points to the coast, meanwhile there is coast behind him.)",
        "All right.",
        "Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let’s start sailing, and I want to go over there (Points) where that boatload of girls is! (Yelling to them) Yo-ho-ho!",
        "Uh, boat rope.",
        "Uh, rub it?",
        "I’d say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh…",
        "And deaf!",
        "Yes.",
        "I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "I don’t want to talk about it. Y’know, you could’ve at least saved me a whole cookie. (He grabs what’s left of the cookie and pops in his mouth.)",
        "(recoils in horror) Women are mean!!! (Storms out.)",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "Oh uh, I don’t know the boat way to say this, but uh never!",
        "Because! You’re mean on the boat!",
        "Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!",
        "Does a good teacher say, \"Put down the beer pinhead!?\"",
        "Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?",
        "Well it hit me anyway! And it would’ve hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.",
        "You won’t boss me around anymore?",
        "And you’ll be nice?",
        "And you’ll be topless?",
        "Do you want me to learn?!",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "Nope.",
        "I don’t know why you just don’t say left.",
        "Huh?",
        "(hurrying over) Okay! Okay, you’re yelling again! See that?",
        "Oh, y’know what? Since I’m here, I think I’m gonna have me a little beer on the port side. (Grabs and opens one.)",
        "Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn’t know there.",
        "Oh, y’know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!",
        "All right that’s it! You’re yelling and I don’t see you taking your top off! I quit!",
        "Why not?!",
        "Greens? I’m a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!",
        "Yes! Yes! You did and you’re still yelling at me!",
        "Well, hey I did learn.",
        "Yeah! Come on.",
        "Yeah, it’s okay. I know what a mainsail is. (Points to it. It’s the larger sail.) I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.",
        "Damnit!",
        "Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don’t you give a pull on that rope? (Points.)",
        "Just pull on it.",
        "What else?",
        "Thank you.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "What you—don’t hold it like that! You’re lettin’ all the good stuff fall out.",
        "Careful! You’re wasting good pastrami! (Gasps.) Oh my God! I’m my dad!",
        "Uhh, well I’ve got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt. (Removes his hand to reveal a huge sauce stain.) You got an extra one?",
        "Great. (He doesn’t like it.) You got anything that’s not Ralph Lauren?",
        "All right, I guess this will be fine.",
        "Nothing, why?",
        "Huh, Rach I got to say it’s gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.",
        "Really? ‘Cause I could kinda use the money.",
        "Yeah, okay.",
        "Sure, no problem. (Sees something.) Ooh—Hey, donuts!",
        "Okay. (He grabs a jelly donut, takes a bite, and guess what he spills all over himself. He tries to clean it up and smears it all over the shirt.)",
        "See? That’s a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera. (Chandler immediately does The Face.) You’re changing it!",
        "All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?",
        "Okay, first—first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down (Looks down), look down, keep looking down; then I look up. (Looks up and smiles.) See? All right, now you try. Look down (Chandler looks down), you’re looking down, keep looking down…",
        "I had a donut. (Chandler nods.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah! That guy’s alright!",
        "What?",
        "Hey well, you can’t teach someone to be good with women. Y’know, that’s why I never had any luck with Chandler.",
        "Hey! No-no-no-no, you can’t take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!",
        "(shocked) What?!",
        "I know, Monica told me.",
        "I don’t know Rach.",
        "One! (Pause.) No ten! You said ten! You can’t take that back!",
        "I don’t know. You uh, you got something for me?",
        "Ten. Okay. Now Tag there’s such a thing as too many women.",
        "Yeah, for you!",
        "Yeah, we look great together.",
        "Y’know, we don’t have to imagine.",
        "We’ll just see.",
        "Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?",
        "Die Hard 2.",
        "Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!",
        "And?",
        "What are you talking about? Bitch.",
        "Well, I don’t know!!",
        "Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I’d better go.",
        "Yeah. All right, I’ll talk to you later.",
        "No! Never! Never! (Pause, then Joey wants to shake Ross’s hand.) Bye.",
        "Hey! What’s going on?",
        "Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember? (Phoebe glares at him.)",
        "Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you’d handle maid of honor type situations.",
        "Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I’m the best of the people they see, they give me the part.",
        "Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.",
        "Hi.",
        "Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.",
        "Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!",
        "Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!",
        "Okay! When?!",
        "Uh-huh!",
        "I want to do it again.",
        "Why not?",
        "Fine! Do you want something to drink?",
        "Warm milk and Excedrin P.M. (Ross just leaves.)",
        "Okay, all right, this is how it’s going to work. We’re gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.",
        "Why is 10 the highest?",
        "(crying) I don’t want to marry Chandler!",
        "I’ve got cold feet.",
        "No, one man for the rest of my life? I don’t know if I can do it! This means I’ll never get to sleep with Joey!",
        "(out of his Monica character) Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!",
        "Okay, Phoebe…",
        "We’re now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, \"I do\" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!",
        "Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!",
        "Oh! That’s nice.",
        "Wow. (To Ross) Good speech.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And she’s back in the game.",
        "All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel—Damnit!",
        "Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.",
        "Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch. (Raises his eyebrows, questioning Ross to see if he wants to join him.)",
        "No reason, I’m just saying that uh… That’s where I’ll be.",
        "Great nap.",
        "(reacting first by jumping up) Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God! (Heads for his room leaving Ross.)",
        "Hey.",
        "I do. There’s uh, let’s see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I’ve Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!",
        "Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might’ve happened to a huge chunk of it.",
        "Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!",
        "(about to cry) Those two only had each other!",
        "Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin’ it by the park.",
        "Hey Pheebs?",
        "Hey Rach?",
        "That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like this? (He shows her what he’s been drawing.)",
        "Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford p0rn.",
        "(watching the discussion) Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?",
        "Yeah lady! Give us candy!!",
        "What’s up buddy?",
        "Waiting for candy.",
        "(stepping in and knocking the man over) Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!",
        "That’s right, it’s all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it! (Steps into the apartment and Chandler closes the door.) (Joey struts over to the candy and starts eating it.)",
        "(with his mouth full) Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don’t know… (Grabs the note.)",
        "Morning!",
        "Pretty good.",
        "Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I’m late for work.",
        "Yeah—Hey, don’t worry, she’s a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I’m not looking for a serious relationship; that’d be great.",
        "Just casually slip it in, y’know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I’m a loner—No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn’t want to get mixed up with the likes of me.",
        "Hey, I’m gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He’d even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he’d make extras and leave ‘em for me.",
        "Fine! (Pause) Now, where’d we land on those pancakes? (She chases him out the door as his date emerges from the bathroom.)",
        "Hey! What’s up?",
        "Hey-hey, who’s your friend? (Erin turns around to face Joey, startling him) Hey!!",
        "Erin! Still here!",
        "Why wouldn’t ya? Erin is great! Then-then there’s you guys.",
        "Yeah. I’ll uh, I’ll call ya.",
        "(to Erin) Okay, good to see you again.",
        "Bye-bye.",
        "So, system kinda broke down huh?!",
        "What?!!",
        "No idea? Who do you think brought her here?",
        "Man, do you know what guys want!",
        "My beers?! Look you guys, she’s a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I just—I don’t see it going anywhere.",
        "Look, I’m sorry you guys, I-I just don’t think so.",
        "Hey, don’t start judging me! (To Rachel) Huh? You’re the one who’s in love with her assistant! (To Phoebe) Huh? And you, you’re the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!",
        "Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?",
        "All right, so we should go catch our movie.",
        "I like to see the previews. (Rachel looks at him.) The candy.",
        "Hey!",
        "Erin.",
        "(skeptical) What party?",
        "Who’s birthday party?",
        "(still skeptical) Oh, and how old is Alison?",
        "(still skeptical) Yeah, look how that worked out.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!",
        "No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y’know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.",
        "Yeah, that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if we were ever to have kids, well that’s a…",
        "Okay.",
        "How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!",
        "What about Game 1 of the Series?",
        "You shut up! (To Phoebe and Rachel) I love arguing with her. (To Erin) I’ll be right back.",
        "(returning) Hey! You wanna go?",
        "Okay. See you guys later.",
        "(whispers to Phoebe and Rachel) Hey, thank you so much. (They both exit.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still… And guess what, I’m thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.",
        "No-no-no-no-no! It’s a surprise, but it’s gonna be tricky though because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.",
        "Where are you gettin’ this?",
        "Oh. Oh.",
        "No hey Rach, it’s cool okay? Y’know I’m a loner too! (Heads for his room.) Right?",
        "No! No. Don’t do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.",
        "Yeah?",
        "(coming back out) Finally!",
        "Hey. (He exits)",
        "Hey! Great, you’re home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas! (Starts drumming.)",
        "(yelling) No! Drums!",
        "Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. (To Rachel) Ready? One, two, three, four...",
        "Tequila!!",
        "Thank you. (He gets up and puts on his jacket.) (Phoebe enters) Hey Pheebs!",
        "Here. (Gives her the coins) Now I only owe you $49.50.",
        "What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?",
        "Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! (He plays a drum-roll) Okay, what is it?",
        "Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey! (He storms into his room)",
        "(entering wearing a Superman costume) Merry Christmas!",
        "(yelling from the bedroom) Is it back in the cage?",
        "Cage closed?",
        "Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.",
        "Fifty-six!",
        "Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports team!",
        "46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?",
        "(gets up) All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.",
        "But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?",
        "Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.",
        "What the hell is in there?",
        "Yeah that dog left!",
        "(interrupting him) Don't do it!",
        "Told ya. (Waves bye-bye.)",
        "Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin’ ice cream.",
        "Half hour. (Rachel turns to look at him and he nods yes.)",
        "All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.",
        "Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.",
        "Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.",
        "(through the window) All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!",
        "(realizes what he said) Street noise drowned any of that out? (Rachel moves madly towards him) No, all right, I see you later, okay... (Turns away embarrassed)",
        "(entering) Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! (Sees that Chandler has a worried look on his face) What's the matter?",
        "So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.",
        "Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.",
        "Ross, you need some help?",
        "(sits down next to Ross) First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!",
        "Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.",
        "If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.",
        "Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!",
        "You think?",
        "(looking through his binoculars at a nearby building) Y’know what else makes you wonder?",
        "Check out the rack on this chick! (Turns around to point it out to Ross and finds that Ross is glaring at him. So he quickly puts his binoculars to his eyes and starts looking for the comet.)",
        "Then why are you wearing Monica’s jacket?",
        "(whispering) Ross!",
        "Come here, check this out!",
        "No! No-no. Look, there’s a bug stuck in tar right here. (Bends down to get a closer look.)",
        "(standing up) Y’know, there’s two women dude.",
        "Right-right up here. (Starts looking at them through a piece of pipe.)",
        "(annoyed) I don’t know! (Goes back to looking through the pipe.) (Pause) Yeah, I do.",
        "What?! All right—Hey! Don’t look at me! You’re the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet!",
        "(covering his ears and yelling) Oh no! No! No! (He starts banging on the door.)",
        "Come on!",
        "All right well, y’know…I guess we know what we have to do to get down.",
        "Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape. (Points it out.)",
        "All right, it won’t go down any further. It’s stuck.",
        "Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!",
        "What if I smack my head on the concrete?",
        "(looks at the ground and at Ross) I don’t know Ross! I-I tell you what, let’s flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?",
        "No.",
        "What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I’m not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can’t go if I break my leg.",
        "Well all right so, it looks like we’re even!",
        "Man, I’m starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! \"Do you want soup or salad?\" Both! Always order both!",
        "Yeah? Really? No one’s home?",
        "Yeah!",
        "All right! Just hurry up!",
        "I think face to face.",
        "Face to face, yeah!",
        "All right.",
        "(grunting) Oh my… How much do you weigh Ross?!",
        "Y’know, when we talked about face to face, I don’t think we thought it all the way through.",
        "Well, just shimmy down me and drop!",
        "Hi.",
        "(angrily) Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!",
        "It’s not that far! Just drop!",
        "Ross, you should know that my pants are startin’ to come down and I’m not wearing any underwear!",
        "All right, I should get going, big day at work. Y’know I’m in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I’m not brain dead.",
        "Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it’s just my character that’s not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?",
        "I’ll see you at 8:00.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!",
        "Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for s*x!",
        "Wow! I’m so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.",
        "Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I’m sorry. (They hug.) How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I’ll pay for myself!",
        "The Ross—Is that back?!! (Chandler motions no.)",
        "Awww! Mel Torme died.",
        "Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody’s sale is over?!",
        "Hey.",
        "Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross’s behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y’know, since she has a chance to get on broad back…",
        "Aww that’s nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "(seeing what they’re doing) What do you got there?",
        "Huh? Uh… (He starts taking off his pants.)",
        "Oh! (Pulls up his pants.) Sorry. Uh, I’ve got those plans with Phoebe, why?",
        "What?! Tonight?!",
        "After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she’s trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!",
        "Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin’ here?",
        "Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.",
        "Oh well, that changes everything! (Grabs his menu and starts looking at it again. The waiter leaves.) Y’know what Pheebs?",
        "You were right before. I mean, friends are so important.",
        "Y’know-y’know what I really want?",
        "Is to have a long, long talk. Y’know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.",
        "Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.",
        "What’s the rush? What?",
        "Whoa-whoa, what is it?",
        "A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn’t schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!",
        "No, I’m gonna!! That’s right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin’ out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you’re doing the same thing!",
        "Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!",
        "Well, she graduated from high school!",
        "Fine!",
        "Fine!",
        "(to the waiter) What are you still doin’ here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!",
        "No! No! No Pheebs, I’m not gonna yell at you. I just y’know, started thinking about you and David and I…remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just… Oh Pheebs, come here. (He hugs her.) Are you okay?",
        "Hey, y’know you could always visit him.",
        "Anything I can do? Whatever you need.",
        "I can give it a shot.",
        "(pulls out a fork) All right, what are we havin’? (Starts digging in.)",
        "Hey.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "(laughs) Why would you want to do that?",
        "Rach, there is a decent place to…",
        "No. No. No.",
        "No. Rosita does not move.",
        "As in Rosita does not move.",
        "The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it’s at the perfect angle so you don’t get any glare coming of off Stevie.",
        "(glaring at her) Is there a problem?",
        "I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don’t, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?",
        "(slowly turning and glaring at her) She’s not even cold yet!",
        "That’s true.",
        "Yeah, I… (Shuts off the TV.) I don’t want Stevie to see her like this.",
        "No I won’t.",
        "Because, I know what I like and what I don’t like! It’s not the same thing!",
        "I don’t know why you say that so soon.",
        "Francette? What is she? A couch?",
        "Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.",
        "Well, I guess you’re right. Maybe, maybe I’ll take her down to the incinerator. It’s gonna be so said, and kinda cool. (He goes to remove the back, but it doesn’t come off. So he sits down in it, puts his feet up, stands up, and looks back at it.) She’s heeled!",
        "No it’s not weird, it’s a miracle!",
        "Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!",
        "(interrupting her) Can you tell me how this happened?",
        "Miracle!",
        "Someone like an…angel?",
        "(angrily) Get your non-believer ass outta my chair! (She gets up and heads for her room.)",
        "Yeah, me too. (He flips up his armrest in disgust.)",
        "Fine.",
        "No. Really?",
        "(quietly) My chair heels itself.",
        "Well, it looks like it wasn’t heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now! (Sits down in it and groans.)",
        "Your chair?!",
        "So, there was no miracle?!",
        "(sarcastic) Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I’m so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.",
        "How do you figure?",
        "That’s right!",
        "Yeah! We are!",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "Ahhh…… (To Rachel) Eh?",
        "Hey!",
        "They do!",
        "Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.",
        "(screaming) Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!! (He buries his head in Phoebe’s lap for comfort.)",
        "(screaming) And now Chandler! We’re all gettin’ so old! (Looking up) Why are you doing this to us?! (Turns away crying.)",
        "Yeah, your roommate is a soap opera star.",
        "Hey, what’s the horsepower on this thing?",
        "But it hurt’s my Joey’s Apple.",
        "Well actually…",
        "Dude, you soooo need this car.",
        "Yep. (Starts for Monica’s room, but Chandler stops him.)",
        "Now that you’re a couple, we don’t get two presents from you guys?",
        "Will you quit hoggin’ it!",
        "(to the waiter) Hey! Are those crab cakes? (The waiter nods) Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?",
        "Yeah!!",
        "Oh, I don’t know Pheebs. It’ll be okay.",
        "That’s not gonna happen. No. (Looks up) Because we have a new deal!",
        "Like what?",
        "Hey, y’know what you guys? I think I’m gonna go walk her home. (Gets up and runs out.)",
        "Pheebs! Wait up! (She stops.) Listen uh, close your eyes. (She does so and Joey passionately kisses her.) Maybe that’s one thing you can cross off your list.",
        "Oh, and plus I’m 1/16th Portuguese.",
        "Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!",
        "Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?",
        "Okay! (Runs off downstairs.)",
        "Yes!",
        "(entering, limping, and holding his arm) I don’t like this anymore. (He sits down with them in pain.)",
        "(crying) Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?! (He buries his head in Ross’s shoulder.)",
        "All-all right! (They run and jump in the car.) Start it up! Let’s go!",
        "No.",
        "(entering, excited) Hey!",
        "So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and…",
        "Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you’re not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!",
        "And-and-and not only that, I’m gettin’ a new brain!!",
        "Oh well, they’re killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.",
        "(seriously) Yes, it’s a highly controversial procedure.",
        "Well, I think it’s ridiculous that you haven’t had s*x in three and a half months.",
        "Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.",
        "Nice.",
        "Oh, tell me about it. And she’s been on the show forever, it’s gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.",
        "Yes, but in Drake Ramoray’s body. (Ross laughs unbelievably.) Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!",
        "That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?",
        "Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.",
        "Say what?",
        "No. No, I’m Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I’m the guy in the coma!",
        "An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I’m getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me…",
        "(quickly) I don’t know. Why? Did you hear something?",
        "Oh uh, one of the writers.",
        "Umm…",
        "Okay.",
        "Ms. Monroe… (She slaps him) Oh there you go. (She storms off, leaving Joey standing next to Dina. They share a nod at the ferocity of the slap they just received.)",
        "So you like the nachos uh? Myself I’m partial to…",
        "See you in 2003. (She walks away.)",
        "I’m so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.",
        "No I mean it! I can’t believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!",
        "Joey.",
        "Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye—l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I’m really nervous about-about being you. Y’know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y’know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?",
        "Oh that’s great! Oh thank you so much!",
        "Hey! Now, I’ve been watching some tapes, how’s this? (In a British accent.) \"Jessica Lockhart will never set foot in this place again! Ever!!\"",
        "Yeah.",
        "(shocked) I can do an English accent?! That baby’s going on my résumé!",
        "Okay! (He scurries out the set door and re-enters, extremely impressed) All right!",
        "Okay. Okay. (He goes out and comes back in, glaring at everything.)",
        "Oh well—Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y’know? It’ll-it’ll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You’re so talented.",
        "Hey that’s not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb—Angelina Jolie!",
        "Like-like what?",
        "(impressed) Wow!",
        "Oh hey come on, don’t-don’t-don’t do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I’m thinking, \"Boy, she-she is a great actress!\" (She’s not buying it.) Uh but-but, I am also thinking, \"She is hot!\"",
        "You own the room. (She smiles and stares longingly into his eyes.) We should probably get-get uh…",
        "Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that ‘cause she’s so passionate?",
        "Yeah! Okay. (He puts his hands on her face and they kiss.)",
        "Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.",
        "Hey!",
        "That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.",
        "(shrugs) Sure. Yep.",
        "Okay, bye-bye.",
        "All right, here we go. (He grabs them and starts to pull them out of the apartment.)",
        "Thanks for stopping by. See ya! (Throws them out and closes the door.) (To Cecilia) I-I am so sorry. I…",
        "(notices something in the mail that Rachel brought in) Oh my God!",
        "They sent me today’s script! They never send the script!",
        "Well no, I’m just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! (Realizes what that means.) Oh…",
        "(flipping to the last page) Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.",
        "Yeah well, I’m guessing after this she’s not going to be crazy about electricity either.",
        "(as Jessica) I don’t think so.",
        "Oh noo…",
        "Thanks!",
        "Great! Hey! Alright! Well-well what is it?!",
        "The airport?",
        "Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?",
        "That’s a really long time.",
        "Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first. (Realizes.) And I just got what you meant again—That is—I tell ya, that is a tricky one!",
        "Good luck.",
        "I call it!!",
        "Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!",
        "So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?",
        "Well then let me do it!",
        "No-no-no! Look, I’ve been thinking about it. I’m an actor right? So I won’t get nervous talking in front of people.",
        "No-no-no-no look no! I won’t spit, and I won’t stare at Monica’s breasts! Y’know? Everyone knows I’m an ass man!",
        "Yeah and the most important thing is that it won’t be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It’ll be me! And I swear I’ll do a really good job. Plus, y’know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.",
        "So I can do it?",
        "All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have s*x right?",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh! My head! Oh! (He’s sitting on the chair, lies back, and puts his feet up for Monica to rub.) Oh!",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani! (Holds up the piece of paper bearing the proof of his ordination.)",
        "Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of p0rn out there!",
        "Anyway, I started working on what I’m going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?",
        "Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so… (Starts to read the piece of paper he brought.) \"We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share.\" (Monica and Chandler like it so far.) Eh? (He continues reading.) \"It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving.\" (Phoebe nods her approval.) \"We too can share and love and have and receive.\"",
        "Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?",
        "(reading) \"When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and…\" And then I can’t think of a good word for right here. (He points to the stop on the paper where he left off.)",
        "Yes!",
        "Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?",
        "I gotcha. Sorry. (To Monica) So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?",
        "Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I’ll talk about London! Y’know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won’t say hooked up. I’ll say, \"Began their beautiful journey…\"",
        "\"…by doin’ it.\"",
        "Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y’know you’re in the bathtub together and she’s feeding you strawberries?",
        "Yeah!! I call that London style.",
        "Oh.",
        "Yeah baby!",
        "Oh.",
        "Yeah baby!",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, dude I’m so sorry!",
        "Hey no-no-no-no! It’s cool! It’s cool! I-I’ll only be a second, I’m still with my bridesmaid, I just—Where are those condoms you brought?",
        "Ah. (Joey walks to Chandler’s bag by getting as far away from Chandler’s bed as possible.)",
        "(pause) For just you?",
        "Hey listen, why don’t you come downstairs with me? There’s some really nice girls down there.",
        "All right, here you go buddy. (He tosses him one.) Go nuts. (Exits.)",
        "That’s what that was?! ‘Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.",
        "Oh… (To Chandler) Can you imagine if I hadn’t left you that last one? You two might’ve never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It’s like it was in the stars!",
        "Yeah baby! (Chandler glares at him.) No baby!",
        "And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv—(Shuts up on Monica’s glare.)",
        "Hey! (Monica turns and looks at him) Now I’m a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!",
        "What?! That’s not fair! It’s not my fault! I was off with my bridesmaid! And who’s to say I would’ve even said yes?! (To Monica) I mean I would’ve said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way too big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!",
        "This is crazy.",
        "Hey.",
        "Chandler, come on nothing even happened!",
        "No-hey-no! If you don’t want me to do it, I accept that. I don’t care about that. I just…I don’t want you to be upset.",
        "Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You’re so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, ‘cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y’know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just…it-it fits. Y’know? And you just know it’s gonna last forever.",
        "What?",
        "Really? I can do it?",
        "Hey! (They hug.)",
        "Well I don’t know if I remember exactly but, it’s-it’s pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving.",
        "Hey!",
        "So are guys doing okay?",
        "What’s my little chef got for me tonight?",
        "Ho-ho-ho, (pausing for a rest next to the fridge) fried stuff with cheese!",
        "Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here. (They kiss.) Okay.",
        "Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! (Groans and picks up a piece of food.) How you doin’?",
        "Here you go.",
        "Good for you!",
        "Probably Monica and Chandler.",
        "Hey guys! Look who’s back! It’s Ray-ray!",
        "(excitedly) Who you what? Who you what?!",
        "(excitedly) Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you—what?!!",
        "What?!",
        "(entering) Hello!",
        "Hey Rach. (Stares at her.)",
        "Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?",
        "What, they’re not invited?! Oh no, that’s terrible! They’re gonna be crushed!",
        "(looking around) You got me. I don’t…",
        "Well, I’m sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y’know? Your parents are comin’! Chandler’s parents are comin’! Ross’s parents are comin’!",
        "Well-well—see? Parents are comin’!",
        "(leaning down to her) Maybe you’ll order a little sangria?",
        "We should really learn how to play the real way. (Moves another piece.)",
        "Nice move.",
        "Hey!",
        "No, I’m performing the ceremony. I’m not wearing a tux.",
        "Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.",
        "I don’t think so.",
        "(excitedly) Can I come?! I won’t even talk! You’ll just hear the noise from my video camera.",
        "Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!",
        "Okay…",
        "Hey. (Laughs, then seriously) It happened!",
        "Why are you taking this away from me?",
        "Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah, they’re not coming.",
        "Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They…feel a little unwanted.",
        "Look Mon, if you could just call my mom…",
        "Come on! Look just-just tell—let her know that you really want them to be there. Let’s not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.",
        "Is it her fault that some of them didn’t make it to you?",
        "I don’t know. Just uh, just tell ‘em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or—No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don’t think you can blame it on them, so… (He dials the phone and hands it to Monica.)",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?",
        "Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it’s gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?",
        "Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it’s the same day as my niece’s christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. ‘Cause my part’s just in the beginning I’m not even in the rest of the show—Wedding!",
        "Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little ‘til they get there?",
        "Yeah! Yeah y’know, like warm up the crowd. Ask ‘em where they’re from. ‘Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I’m a minis-tainer! (Rapping) There is no-one better! There is no-one greater!",
        "(entering) Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?",
        "No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They’re so happy they get to be a part of your special day.",
        "Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! (Runs to his apartment and returns wearing a rather silly hat.) Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this (He tilts it to the side of his head) is for party time.",
        "Food? Uh-huh gimme! (She hands him the paper.)",
        "This is impossible Monica, why don’t you just pick all 15? (Hands back the paper.)",
        "Oh yeah, I added three.",
        "Oh yeah… (He mimes sticking his fingers into a jar of peanut butter, scooping some out, and eating it off his fingers.)",
        "(checking her out) Hi! You uh, movin’ in or movin’ out?",
        "Oh uh, can I give you a hand?",
        "Boyfriend?",
        "I’m Joey. (They shake hands.)",
        "Oh wow, what a beautiful name! (Pause) What is it again?",
        "Got it! (He picks up a lamp.) So…",
        "Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. (Points.) Hey listen; let me give you a little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop (Points to hers) or you can wake up with your shoes gone.",
        "Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?",
        "Oh.",
        "Sounds great! Okay, alright, well where does this go? (The lamp he’s holding.)",
        "Okay. Yeah. (She leaves and he goes to pick up a box marked books, but decides to take the box marked pillows instead.) Yeah, I’ll grab this one. (He follows her upstairs.)",
        "(entering) Hey Chandler!",
        "Listen, sorry I didn’t stop by last night but I had a date.",
        "Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Two days ago.",
        "Oh yeah?",
        "Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I’m dating this girl who’s also seeing another guy. But, I don’t know, I’m not too worried about it.",
        "Obviously! So, how do we decide?",
        "(not buying it) Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I’m the one who dates her.",
        "Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction…",
        "Yeah well we should order some food then.",
        "(smiling) That sounds fair.",
        "Ah yeah—wait a second now! Look we’re gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don’t have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.",
        "All right, well I guess I’ll just have to do what I do on dates.",
        "Yeah. Uh, (thinks)…a slice…(Thinks)…six dollars?",
        "Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "I just wanted to come by and y’know, wish you good luck on your date.",
        "Yeah. What time are you meeting her?",
        "Wow, that’s in like 20 minutes. You’d better get dressed.",
        "Oh. Well good! (To himself) For me. (He picks up a jar of lotion.) What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?",
        "Okay dude! (Finds a receipt.) Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.",
        "You spent a hundred dollars. That’s the limit. You’re screwed!",
        "Oh-oh! So that’s the way it’s gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y’know!",
        "I don’t know.",
        "Y’know what Ross? I’m not gonna let you get away with this!",
        "Well we’ll see!",
        "Yeah bye-bye! (Exits and comes back in still holding the lotion.) Hey! So just a light layer?",
        "(entering) Kristen?",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I’m not breaking any rules so I…",
        "Hi!",
        "Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks! (Sits down.)",
        "A woman in a man’s body.",
        "So y’know Ross it’s funny ‘cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?",
        "So you’ve just married the one time then?",
        "(laughs that one off) Yeah. So uh Ross, well now—why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?",
        "No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.",
        "Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!",
        "Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!",
        "Monkey lover!",
        "When do you think we lost her?",
        "Yeah! (Monica goes in the bedroom.) Y’know, she could use a little…(Whistles that she needs to do what they’re doing.) (Something happens on the game.) Oh nice shot!!! (They all cheer.)",
        "Hey! You guys! You’re not gonna believe this! I just got off the phone with my agent…",
        "Okay. I got nominated for my part on Days of Our Lives!",
        "No-no.",
        "No! I’m up for a Soapie!",
        "No, no, no! It’s real! And it has been since 1998. (Rachel returns from the bathroom.) Hey Rach! Rach! I’m up for a Soapie!",
        "Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I’m taking to the awards. (Points to Rachel.)",
        "Many are scheduled to appear.",
        "(pretending to be an announcer) And the winner is…Joey Tribbiani! (He then gets excited and goes over to the counter to practice his acceptance speech using a bottle of maple syrup as the award.) Oh… Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didn’t prepare a speech. But umm, I’d like to thank (Rachel enters quietly) my parents, who’ve always been there for me. I’d also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel…",
        "Yeah may-maybe you don’t tell anyone about this.",
        "Really?",
        "What award are you practicing for?",
        "Oh, hey listen! The Soapie’s called today and I also get to present an award.",
        "Yeah!",
        "(confused) What you-you don’t think I’m gonna win?",
        "Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it’s just…I’ve never even been nominated before! I want it so much.",
        "Hey! (Likes it.)",
        "You practice losing the Grammies too?",
        "Ah.",
        "Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?",
        "Whoa!",
        "Ross has a boyfriend.",
        "How’d you get over that teacher?",
        "(To Ross) Problem solved.",
        "(To Rachel) This is it! This is my category.",
        "Yeah, I got my speech!",
        "Yeah. (Does it.)",
        "Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?",
        "‘Kay!",
        "What the?! (Joey pounds the table and starts yelling at Rachel, and which is drowned out by applause. Rachel is desperately trying to tell Joey that he’s on TV right now. He finally notices and he does his gracious loser face.)",
        "(angrily and monotone) Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. (Shakes his head in disgust.) The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from Passions Erin Goff. (There is applause, which Joey disgustedly waits to dye out.) From One Life to Live Mary Loren Bishop (They start to applaud again, but Joey interrupts in with the rest of the nominees), from All My Children Sarah Mchann, and from Days of Our Lives Jessica Ashley. And the winner is…(Opens the envelope)…Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives. (Applause) Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn’t be with us tonight so I’ll be accepting this award on her behalf. (Realizes something) And I’m sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She’d also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel who’s sittin’ right there! (Points at Rachel.) (The music starts and his microphone is turned off, this angers Joey again and he disgustedly exits.)",
        "Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won! (He whips out the award for Best Supporting Actress that he accepted for Jessica.)",
        "No-no! No, I’m accepting it on her behalf. (He puts it up above the TV to display it.)",
        "Sure I do! It’s a verb! As in, \"I behalfin’ it!\"",
        "But why?! I should’ve won one and I really want it and she didn’t even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.",
        "Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of ‘em.",
        "No! I want an award I did win! But nobody’s giving me any of those! Plus—Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there (Points to the TV) right? When people come over they’ll see it and they’ll think I won it.",
        "I can scratch that right off.",
        "All right!",
        "I’ll take it back tomorrow.",
        "(opening his door) If I can’t have it you can’t have it! (Rachel walks away angrily.)",
        "Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.",
        "Hey Jessica.",
        "Ah, this is my friend Rachel.",
        "Uh listen, here’s your Soapie. I accepted it for ya. (Hands it to her.)",
        "Well, that-that-that’s it? You’re gonna, you’re gonna put it on your self or anything?",
        "(To Rachel) Take it back?",
        "Y-y-yeah! (As they start to leave, Rachel pauses and steals a vase with flowers in it.) Yeah you do. (They exit.)",
        "I’m sorry, do I know you?",
        "Nothing, I’m just practicing blowing you off because I’m gonna be a big movie star!",
        "Well no, not yet. But the audition went really good.",
        "Oh, it’s this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It’s really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next next Martin Scorcese.",
        "Yeah, there’s this guy from Chicago who’s supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy’s right after him. (Joey’s cell phone rings and he answers it.) Hello!",
        "(to Monica and Phoebe) They loved me!",
        "(on phone) Oh my God!",
        "Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! (Listens) Oh. (Listens) Uh, okay uh let me call you back. (Hangs up.)",
        "They want me to be totally naked in the movie!",
        "I know! My grandmother’s gonna see this!",
        "I don’t know! It’s not like it’s p0rn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y’know? And the nudity is really important to the story.",
        "You’re right. Maybe I shouldn’t even go on the call back.",
        "Well that’s true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character’s catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It’s really sweet and-and tender.",
        "Hey, I’m back!",
        "Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?",
        "Oh great! Y’know I would’ve been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y’know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day! (Starts to leave.)",
        "And scene! Huh? Wasn’t that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?",
        "Wow! Sure! That’s great!",
        "Yeah! Yeah sure, just so long as it’s handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.",
        "So…What?",
        "Yes!",
        "No. What?",
        "Barmitsvahed?",
        "Nope.",
        "Yep.",
        "That’s right.",
        "I don’t know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell ‘em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.",
        "I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.",
        "I just have to call my agent and tell her I can’t do the part. (Gets up for the phone.)",
        "Unless what?",
        "Like what?",
        "Wow! This looks great!",
        "And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?",
        "Thank God!",
        "Ah.",
        "Well maybe we just take that one away. (Picks it up and throws it away.)",
        "Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.",
        "Ow!",
        "Yeah.",
        "The fruit roll up.",
        "Delicious.",
        "Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!",
        "The Silly Putty! It’s not so silly anymore!",
        "And what’s cool is, the character is from Naples, right?",
        "My whole family’s from Naples!",
        "Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. (He starts taking off his clothes.) I totally understand. You need to y’know make sure I don’t have any horrible scars or tattoos. Don’t you worry; I have nothing to hide. (He drops his pants and stands, back up and looks down.) So there you go, that’s me. (We cut to a camera angle looking at the casting director and movie director through Joey’s legs.) One hundred percent natural! (Suddenly, there’s a thud as something falls off.) (Everyone is shocked.) I tell ya, that has never happened before.",
        "All right, uh… (To Ross) Oh hey, you’ve done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?",
        "Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, \"Monica…",
        "\"…when I look back over our time together…\"",
        "Well, I can’t do everything! Look back over your time together.",
        "(yelling through the door) Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here!",
        "Hey!",
        "How is \"Monica, I love your sweet ass,\" inappropriate?",
        "(shocked) Has it been that long?!",
        "Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!",
        "Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?",
        "Okay.",
        "I know! I mean it’s not like we weren’t cool about it.",
        "(To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!",
        "How?! When?!",
        "IN LONDON!!!",
        "But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!",
        "All right! Man, this is unbelievable!",
        "Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!",
        "Well I didn't tell them!",
        "Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.",
        "And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!",
        "No.",
        "They know you know.",
        "I couldn't even if I wanted to.",
        "(entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!",
        "Ooh!",
        "I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)",
        "It's not my first time.",
        " So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!",
        "I don’t want them to move to a Volvo dealership!",
        "I’m sorry, I just…I like things the way they are.",
        "Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that’s what you really want.",
        "Hey!",
        "(To Chandler) (laughing) Funny one! That’s good!",
        "What? I don’t get it.",
        "(starting to cry) I have never known love like this.",
        "If he goes first he can!",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin’ good. When do I get to take that baby out again?",
        "Yeah, you got a couple hours?",
        "Hey!",
        "So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?",
        "Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.",
        "So uh, what’s your name?",
        "Joey. (They shake hands.) Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?",
        "Me too! There’s a game on Tuesday, do you wanna go?",
        "Pheebs!",
        "Listen, you know how uh, when you’re wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?",
        "Well, when Jake did it I saw that…he was wearing women’s underwear!",
        "Oh. (Laughs.) No! No wait, that’s weird!",
        "That’s weird!",
        "That’s…kinda hot.",
        "Yeah, I wouldn’t know about that.",
        "Yeah well next thing you know, he’ll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!",
        "Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys.",
        "Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.",
        "You’ve seen my huge stack of p0rn, right? (Phoebe nods.)",
        "Hey Pheebs! (He sits down next to her.)",
        "Check it out. (He turns around, pulls down his pants, and shows Phoebe that he’s got panties on.) How much of a man am I?!",
        "Y’know, I’m beginning to see what Jake was talking about.",
        "The silk? Feels really good!",
        "Yeah! And-and things aren’t as…smashed down as I thought they were gonna be.",
        "Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with men’s underwear!",
        "Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You’ve got cotton, silk, lace! And y’know what I’ve always wondered about?",
        "Pantyhose! Y’know? The way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here… (He mimed that and stops when he realizes he went too far.) I should go take these off shouldn’t I?",
        "Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that I’m y’know insecure about my manhood or anything y’know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.",
        "Yeah! Okay! (He notices a beautiful woman sitting behind the couch and goes to talk to her.) Hey! Hi!",
        "Y’know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?",
        "Oh! Maybe it’s because I’m on television. I’m an actor on Days of Our Lives.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hm-mmm.",
        "Oh, let me get this. (He takes out his wallet, but the panties come with it. The woman and waitress are shocked.) (Realizing) (To the woman) These are for you.",
        "No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure! (They all exit.)",
        "(entering) Hey! You guys! Remember that audition I had a while ago and didn’t get the part?",
        "No!",
        "No!",
        "Nooo!",
        "Yes!!",
        "Yes, that’s the one about the soldiers who fight in World War I!",
        "Well anyway, the guy they wanted backed out and now they want me! I start shooting today!",
        "Oh no, I’ll be done by then.",
        "I know! All right, I’ll see you guys over there! I’m off to fight the Nazis.",
        "Whoa! Okay. Yeah well, who-who was in World War I? (Rachel pauses as she thinks.)",
        "Yeah! Me too. (He pats his pocket.)",
        "I’m doing my scenes with you?",
        "Wow! I can’t believe this! This is incredible. I mean you just won an Oscar!",
        "I think you did.",
        "Uh…Cookie?",
        "We have to find the rest of the platoon!",
        "(wiping his face) What?!",
        "(wipes face) So what are we gonna do?! We have no reinforcements! No-no food!",
        "(glances at Richard) No. Nope, I uh…I th—I thought it might be kind of a cool character thing. Y’know? He’s uh, he’s a face toucher. (Behind his back, Richard is nodding no.)",
        "Hey! Where have you been?",
        "Oh.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won’t get spit in the eyes, y’know?",
        "Great! All right. I’ll see you later. (He starts to leave.)",
        "Uh, I think he’s in Rachel’s room. See ya. (Exits.)",
        "Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!",
        "Alright.",
        "Picture? What picture?",
        "Okay uh, look I know you’re a great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff…",
        "But you’re spittin’ all over me man!",
        "You know you’ve been spitting on me?!",
        "(wiping face) Wow! Didn’t know that.",
        "Thanks! Okay-okay check it out! (Reading from the script) Picture? What picture? (He pauses then spits) Eh?",
        "What picture?!",
        "You went through my personal property?",
        "(pause) Because Vincent, we were lovers. (Pause) For two years!",
        "Great scene yeah?",
        "Thanks a lot.",
        "Oh, I’m-I’m not working tomorrow.",
        "No! No! I can’t! You gotta get me out of it! I’ve got plans! (Spits.) Important plans! (Spits on the Ps.)",
        "Excuse me, Aaron? (The director turns around.) Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn’t supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It’s my best friend’s, and I’m officiating so I really can’t work past four.",
        "I’m having surgery!",
        "Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn’t want you to worry about me. But, I’m having surgery today.",
        "Transplant.",
        "Hair transplant.",
        "It’s not on my head.",
        "Hey! You’re here! Great! Great! Great! Let’s get going buddy, we’ve got a scene to shoot!",
        "Are you drunk?",
        "Yes you are!",
        "I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!",
        "What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!",
        "Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And I’m the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?",
        "Thank you. Thank you.",
        "I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!",
        "(on phone) Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?",
        "Damnit!",
        "I’m still on the set!",
        "I know! I’m sorry! The guy’s drunk, they won’t let me go until we get this.",
        "No! No, I’m the minister! Alright, look-look, put ‘em both on the phone, I’ll marry them right now.",
        "Hey! Don’t you hang up on me! I’ll marry you and me right now! I have the power!",
        "Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy’s hammered!",
        "So I uh, I just talked to the director. That’s it, we’re done for the day.",
        "Yeah! You…you were wonderful.",
        "So I got your car, it’s right outside.",
        "That’s what you told me.",
        "No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on! (Joey picks him up in a fireman’s carry and carries him out.) Here we go.",
        "(entering) That’s my line! (He walks up the aisle and to the rabbi) I can take it from here, thanks. (To all) Dearly beloved, I’m sorry I’m a little late. You may be confused by this now, (He’s still in costume) but you won’t be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let’s get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? (Monica is shocked and looks around.) We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I’ve known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I’ve left my notes in my dressing room, we shall proceed to the vows. Monica?",
        "Chandler?",
        "You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in me by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?",
        "Yeah you do!",
        "Aw crap! Okay—uh…uh let’s-let’s do the rings.",
        "We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. (To Chandler) Now kiss her again.",
        "What? What’s going on?",
        "Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?!",
        "Ah. (To Chandler) Slow swimmers? (Chandler looks at him.)",
        "I can’t! I-I don’t have any other clothes here.",
        "I’m sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and it’s either this or a bathrobe! Look, what’s more important, the way I’m dressed or me being with you on your special day?",
        "That’s better, now just bend your arms a little more. There you go. Okay, look straight ahead. Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it. (They do a practice swing and she really puts her ass into it.)",
        "I don’t believe we’ve met, Joey Tribbiani.",
        "Wow, I’ve admired your work for years. You-you’ve done some really amazing stuff.",
        "Wow Dennis Phillips! That’s great! How did you guys meet?",
        "Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? ‘Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I would’ve done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and that’s just for ugly people.",
        "Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.",
        "Uh, I don’t even really know where I left those. Sorry.",
        "Okay fine! I’m a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good, I’ll show ya!",
        "Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?",
        "No-no! No! No! You don’t tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks I’m a soap actor.",
        "Hey!",
        "(clinks his glass) I’d like to propose a toast. To Monica and Chandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first found out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like, (overly angry) \"Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!\" But then I thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories. (Does a fake laugh.) And-and there was some sad memories. (Starts to break down and cry.) I’m sorry. And-and some scared memories—Whoa! (He jumps back, startled.) Eh? And then, and then I realized I’ll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. (Starts to walk away, but realizes something.) Oh! To the happy couple!",
        "So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there?",
        "Well, I’d like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know you’re casting for this new show…",
        "Oh, see that’s where you’re wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didn’t see it up there, just-just try me.",
        "Well I’m not proud of this, but… (He turns around and starts to mess with his eyelids.)",
        "Shh. Shh. Don’t try to talk, we’ll get you up to your room, we’ll soak your feet, you’ll be okay.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Tell me about it, I feel like I’m holding down the fort all by myself.",
        "Yeah.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "No. (Phoebe grabs the receipt and shows it to Joey who gets mad.) I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill!",
        "Nothing! It was something.",
        "Yeah, that’s sad. Mashuga nut?",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "(warily) Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have an accent? I gotta make a call! (Starts to leave) I shoulda never walked into that Sunglass Hut!",
        "Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on? (Pause.) Is somebody pregnant?",
        "Oh my God Pheebs! You’re gonna have a baby?",
        "Whoa, wait a minute. Who’s the father?",
        "Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? ‘Cause I will track him down and kick his ass!",
        "David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!! (Exits)",
        "(entering) Ooh-ooh-ooh! Are we opening presents?",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay. (Hands her one.)",
        "Oh good, uh you’re here. Uh Pheebs? Listen uh sit down. I-I got something I want to say.",
        "Umm, now uh… It’s a scary world out there, especially for a single mom. Y’know, now I always thought you and I had a special bond so… (He goes to one knee and pulls out a ring.) Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?",
        "Why?! Why can’t she marry me?!",
        "Oh my God.",
        "(smiles then stops) Now I can’t believe it! What? Rachel’s pregnant? (The girls nod yes.) Who’s the father?",
        "Ohh… I wonder if that dude.",
        "Yeah.",
        "About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didn’t see who it was but… (He walks out and closes the door.)",
        "The guy left this.",
        "(entering) You opened them all?",
        "Oh hey! You got my parent’s gift! (Holds it up.)",
        "Well, I don’t know. I think it does something to salami.",
        "Yeah. What-what did Tag say?",
        "I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you. (They hug.)",
        "Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know you’re not gonna be alone in this.",
        "Listen I uh… (He takes her hand.) It’s a scary world out there especially if you’re a single mom. Y’know, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond. Y’know? So, (gets down on one knee again) Rachel Green will you marry me?",
        "Pheebs, give me the ring back!",
        "(heartbroken) I understand.",
        "Uh yeah. Pheebs, listen about that. I only offered…",
        "There you go!",
        "(slow on the uptake) Oh my God!",
        "(entering with Phoebe) Hey!",
        "We know its Ross!",
        "I’m gonna be an uncle! Come here! (He joins the hug.)",
        "Well that, that sounds good.",
        "Bye.",
        "What secrets?",
        "(whispering to Chandler) You’ll tell me later?",
        "Y’know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something.",
        "I don’t have a key, they took mine to give to you.",
        "Why would they take away our keys?",
        "No that’s not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.",
        "Hey, I washed those!",
        "Yeah that didn’t sound like me.",
        "Yeah, I have stuff in there too.",
        "Monica’s chicken parm! I’ll take care of it. (He picks up the phone) Hey Mr. Treeger, it’s Joey Tribbiani. Listen, I need to get into Monica and Chandler’s apartment. It’s an emergency. (Listens) Uhh, gas leak! Yeah oh, and bring garlic bread. (Hangs up.)",
        "Yeah, it seemed pretty important.",
        "Really?",
        "Yeah, I don’t think that’s what it is.",
        "Oh wow, I don’t feel well.",
        "Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel.",
        "I still can’t believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.",
        "What the hell is that?",
        "Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?",
        "(eating) Huh. So then I can heat this up? (Goes and does so.)",
        "So it’s noticeable huh?",
        "(simultaneously) Oh my God!!! I can’t believe that!!",
        "How are you doing?",
        "Well, what did you say to her?",
        "(shocked) What?",
        "Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they don’t even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!",
        "What?! (Grabs his condoms from his pocket and looks.)",
        "Hey Monica it’s Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin’ from your apartment.",
        "Yeah and we’d go check it out, but you took away our keys.",
        "How? I guess I could break down your door.",
        "And-and you won’t blame us for any damage? (Gives Phoebe a thumbs up.)",
        "Uh, okay I’ll-I’ll-I’ll break it down. (He hands the phone to Phoebe, gets up, picks up a chair, and starts banging it on the floor.)",
        "Hey!",
        "I don’t see the baby. Where is it?",
        "(To Rachel) Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner.",
        "I’m not telling, you’ll have to see it on TV!",
        "No, couldn’t care less.",
        "Hey you too!",
        "What? You weren’t in it.",
        "Oh sorry. Uh-uh, Kash?",
        "This is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel.",
        "(grabbing her) Here we go! Here we go! (Starts to pull her away from Kash.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.",
        "Hey, I’m with you. He even asked me if I thought you’d go out with him.",
        "I said no.",
        "What? I…I just figured since you’re pregnant you’re not gonna be seeing people.",
        "I didn’t tell him. I didn’t know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.",
        "Rach look, I really don’t think that’s such a great…",
        "Hey!",
        "No. No. But I’ll go see a normal person movie with ya.",
        "It’s no Ukrainian film.",
        "I set her up with this actor on my show.",
        "No",
        "Well, I was thinking that it’d probably be okay because Ross hasn’t gone out with Rachel in five years!",
        "Hey! I’m an (does the quote-marks thing as well) actor too! I’m not sure. I think they’re taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island.",
        "Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?",
        "Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash.",
        "So what movie do you want to see—And not another one I have to read. Okay? I get enough of that from books.",
        "All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it’s like enough!",
        "And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?",
        "Dude! What is going on?!",
        "Why?",
        "They go on one date and you’re worried about them getting married?! He’s not you!",
        "Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?",
        "What do you mean?",
        "That’s a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!",
        "Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?",
        "Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn’t Rachel.",
        "I know, but I don’t think that’s what she wants.",
        "That’s okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It’s not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there’s gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?",
        "Hey, I tell you what. Let’s you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on!",
        "No, I said fun!",
        "It’s a grand tradition!",
        "This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasn’t allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!",
        "Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.",
        "So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. How’s it going?",
        "Hot?",
        "I’m gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.",
        "Will you let the lady talk?!",
        "Yeah!",
        "(on cell phone) I’m sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby…",
        "So you uh, nervous about getting married?",
        "Look, look let’s pretend it’s a real bachelor party. Okay? Y’know? Before your wedding. Come on, it’ll be fun.",
        "How does it feel knowing you’re never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing you’re gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.",
        "That’s her! Okay, come on! (They go over and open the door.)",
        "Uh, that-that’s-that’s me!",
        "Joey Tribbiani, a big fan.",
        "Why-why would she go in the bedroom?",
        "Yeah, that’s one naked hooker!",
        "Wait! Wait! Maybe she’s a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what she’s supposed to do.",
        "Maybe Monica’s playing a joke on ya. Y’know? Getting her own husband a hooker, that’s pretty funny.",
        "I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.",
        "(on machine) Hey Ross. It’s Joey. There’s a hooker over here and we thought maybe you’d know something about it.",
        "Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.",
        "Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything you’re really bad at y’know, sexually?",
        "In a minute!",
        "All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.",
        "Hey! It’s your bachelor party.",
        "I don’t want to. You do it!",
        "You do it!",
        "I miss this.",
        "No, I-I miss hanging out with you.",
        "Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. Y’know now it’s like…things are different.",
        "Oh sure—And hey, don’t get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys. I just…I miss…hanging out…just-just us, y’know?",
        "You got it. Come here. (They hug and are observed by the hooker.)",
        "(on phone) Hey! I do too think about the consequences of my decisions! (Listens) What gives you the right to… (Listens) Go to hell! (Hangs up the phone and opens the fridge.) Stupid guy on my phone.",
        "Look, I’ll come to the party but I’m not dressing up.",
        "No way! Look, Halloween is so stupid! Dressing up, pretending to be someone you’re not…",
        "That hot girl from their wedding?",
        "Well hey-hey if she needs any idea for costumes, she could be a bikini model, or a slutty nurse, or a sexy cheerleader huh—Ooh-ooh, Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre—No-no-no! Slutty Leatherface.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Yes I did! I’m Chandler. (Looks at Chandler) Dude, what happened?",
        "Okay. I’m Chandler (makes a growling/gurgling sound at the end and the girls laugh.)",
        "When have I ever done that?! (And does the sound again.)",
        "(sees Ross) Hey all right, Ross came as doody.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Exclusively.",
        "Catwoman, hands down.",
        "But between you and Phoebe, I’d have to give the edge to Phoebe.",
        "Are you kiddin’? Phoebe lived on the street. Okay? Plus, she’s got this crazy temper. She—She’s not standing right behind me is she?",
        "I’m not sure.",
        "Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for? It doesn’t matter.",
        "I would say, \"Woman, please!\"",
        "(To Monica) Here comes the temper.",
        "Okay, here’s a good one for ya. Who do think would win in a fight between Ross and Chandler.",
        "So Ross?",
        "(To Monica) Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question.",
        "Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?",
        "So you think Ross too?",
        "Hey Monica! (Grabs her and pulls her into the living room.) People came to see a fight, let’s give ‘em what they came for!",
        "Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.",
        "Seriously guys, the trash talk is embarrassing.",
        "Rach?",
        "(entering) Pheebs come on! Bunny vs. Doody! We’re waiting! (They go inside.) (To Chandler and Ross.) Okay. Okay guys, one match, winner take all. (They grasp each other’s hand in preparation for battle.) Oh wait-wait! What does the winner get?",
        "(laughing) Okay, if you say so. All right, ready? Set! Go!",
        "Or equally weak.",
        "(to her) You’re a weird lady.",
        "Hey!",
        "That’s not so bad.",
        "Come on! You’re good with kids. They’re just crazy on Halloween. Y’know, they’re all greedy and hopped up on sugar!",
        "Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmas…and their birthdays. Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. And anytime they’re hungry or sleepy. Y’know, kids are tough. Good luck with that. (Walks away.)",
        "(entering) Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?",
        "(laughs) No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.",
        "All right, well finish your coffee; let’s go.",
        "To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you’re not gonna be on TV!",
        "Oh, you’re switching apartments?",
        "But Rachel has an apartment.",
        "She is?",
        "I guess I didn’t really think about it.",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, okay. I…I ate way too much.",
        "Ooh. (Notices the pizza, grabs a slice, and takes a bite.) So umm, I was talkin’ to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place.",
        "I was kinda hoping you’d stay.",
        "No room? It’s a baby. It’s like this big. (Holds his hands about a foot apart.) Y’know, I mean you-you could you could put it over here. (A desk.) Or-or-or we could put it right here. (The chair.) Aw, it’s cute, right? Or-or we could put it over here. (By the bathroom door.) You wouldn’t even notice it. Where’s the baby? (Mumbles that it’s over in the corner.)",
        "I could use a challenge! It’s getting pretty easy.",
        "I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn’t have to change.",
        "Y’know I blame Ross for this.",
        "I’m gonna miss you, you’re the hottest roommate I ever had.",
        "Hey! Uh, this is just to give you an idea. Okay well, we can put screens here, (In front of the crib.) so that the baby has privacy, and-and-and maybe a mobile over the crib. And uh—Oh look! Here’s a baby monitor (Holds it up), which until the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. Huh?",
        "Ahhhhhhhhhhhh…. That-that-that’s really just to show where the baby would go. Y’know why don’t I hold on to him so that there’s no confusion? (Takes him back, sets him on the chair, and apologizes to him.)",
        "I’m loud!",
        "I’m up all night!",
        "Hello!",
        "Look, if I’m bringing home a woman who can’t stand being around a baby, then maybe I don’t want to be with that woman! Or maybe we’ll just do it in the bathroom of the club!",
        "Yeah! All right—Look, I know sometimes it’ll be hard, okay? But, it’ll also be really…really great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay.",
        "Ohh!",
        "I know! I found it on the street.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I don’t know.",
        "Ew.",
        "Ooh! Ah! Okay! (Quickly drags the crib outside.)",
        "Isn’t that great?",
        "Oh hey Rach, listen—Hi!",
        "Umm, can you do me a favor? I was talkin’ to my sister and she knows you work at Ralph Lauren…",
        "No-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her. My youngest sister, Dina, she’s really interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, y’know, to give her some advice.",
        "Oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!",
        "Okay, so will you meet with her?",
        "Great! Thanks! You’re gonna love her so much. And—Oh, she’s the smartest of all the Tribbiani children. Hey, y’know the S.A.T’s?",
        "She took ‘em!",
        "(entering, with Dina) Here she is! Future fashion superstar!",
        "My little sister Dina!",
        "This is so exciting for her. Well, I’ll let you two fash…ists get down to business. (Exits.)",
        "Hey! It’s my fashion girls! (They don’t react.) What’s wrong?",
        "(concerned) Oh. What’s, what’s going on? Is it mom? Is she sick? Is it dad’s heart? Is that a sandwich?",
        "Is that a sandwich?!",
        "(angrily) What?!",
        "Well obviously this is a mistake! You can’t be pregnant! Because you have to have s*x to get pregnant!",
        "(to Rachel) Bub!!! (Points at her and quiets Rachel.) (To Dina) I can’t believe this! You’re the good one! You went to college! Both years! Who did this to you?!",
        "You got pregnant for funny?! Dina…if he’s funny…laugh! All right, I’ll be back in a little while! You stay here!",
        "I can’t look at you right now! (Exits and slams the door behind him.)",
        "Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman…",
        "Don’t interrupt me when I’m talkin’ to God! Now where were we? Oh right, okay. Do you Dina, take this man…",
        "Oh you’ll take ‘em!",
        "Hey! You don’t get a say in this!",
        "Ahhh! I heard \"I do\", we’re halfway there! Okay! (To Bobby) You!",
        "Well what am I supposed to do?",
        "No they can’t! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!",
        "Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Let’s hear their plan! Now, what’s the future look like for Dina and Bobby?",
        "(to Dina) You were right. He is funny.",
        "Dina, if you’re having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to Bobby! (Bobby gets happy.) Dude, that’s not a compliment!",
        "So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? You’re gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourself…without a husband?! You can’t be a single mother alone! You’re gonna ruin your life!",
        "No! No! No! It’s different for you. You’re so strong and together. You’re not some dumb kid who doesn’t know what she’s doing.",
        "One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.",
        "Maybe! (To Bobby) Well! Well…so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts—Oh forget it! I can’t!",
        "Because! ‘Cause… ‘Cause you’re my baby sister!",
        "Well I’d be scared of them, but all right.",
        "Of course he’s gonna have his Uncle Joey!",
        "That’s right! By his uncle too!",
        "Come here! (Hugs Dina and Bobby looks to hug Rachel.)",
        "Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.",
        "(laughing) You fall for it every time!",
        "I just want you to say it once in a while.",
        "What?!",
        "Phoebe!",
        "No they’re not! They’re ugly and stupid and delicious!",
        "She is?",
        "Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.",
        "But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!",
        "No there won’t! I promise I will finish that turkey!",
        "That’s right! ‘Cause I’m a Tribbiani! (To Rachel) And this is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we don’t read a lot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!",
        "Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach first. Eatin’ chips is like stretching.",
        "Don’t worry, Tribbianis never get full.",
        "(To Monica) Who the hell is this guy?",
        "Oh hey!",
        "That’s it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. At least give me a challenge!",
        "(quietly) Oh. How-how big is that?",
        "(To Rachel) It’s like me when I was born.",
        "(To Monica) Seriously, who is this guy?",
        "I’m afraid I’m gonna need proof.",
        "You are my Everest.",
        "Oh yes I do. Otherwise what’s next? Today I’m just a guy who can’t finish a turkey, but tomorrow I’m the guy who eats half a Powerbar, wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge? No! No, I just…I just—I gotta change my pants. (Gets up and heads for the door.) Jeans have no give. (Exits.)",
        "(entering, wearing the maternity pants from earlier) All right where’s that turkey!",
        "Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!",
        "Well that’s it. I’m done. Whew! (Wipes his forehead.) There come the meat sweats. (Chandler hands him a towel and he wipes his face.)",
        "No just, nobody press on my stomach.",
        "Whoa—hey—wh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?",
        "Ah, just cut me a little sliver. (Monica prepares to cut a little sliver.) A little bigger. (Monica prepares to cut a bigger piece.) Little bigger. (Monica moves the knife again.) What?! Are you afraid you’re gonna run out?! Cut me a real piece!",
        "Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now. (Brushes something off of his shirt and looks around, but doesn’t move from his chair.)",
        "I’m missin’ picture time?! (Jumps over to look, Ross glares at him and he retreats.)",
        "(To Ross) Congratulations! You just got married!",
        "Hey-hey-hey, hey that’s your wife you’re talking about!",
        "Who was that?",
        "You hung up on the pizza place? I don’t hang up on your friends.",
        "Oh, what’s wrong?",
        "Then why did I ask?",
        "Is that college talk for horny?",
        "Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon.",
        "Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too.",
        "Good night. (They both enter their rooms.)",
        "(entering) I can’t do it!",
        "You’re Rachel!",
        "You’re my friend!",
        "But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad.",
        "I know!",
        "Do you wanna do it?",
        "All right, me neither! I was just testing you!",
        "This conversation never happened!",
        "Good night!",
        "Get back in there! (Rachel re-enters her room and closes the door.)",
        "(To Rachel) Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?",
        "Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm…",
        "I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?",
        "Ooh, great! Thanks!",
        "You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone s*x, I’ll tell ya…",
        "Hey, y’know what?",
        "Why don’t I take you out?",
        "Yes I do! And we’re gonna go out, we’re gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out…",
        "I’ll be fun.",
        "No, I’m picking you up for our date. These are for you. (Hands her some flowers.)",
        "And, a brownie! (Hands her a bag with the brownie in it.) Well, half a brownie. Actually, it’s just bag. It’s been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin’ to feel faint so…",
        "Hey come on now, this is a real date. Uh, so…nice place you got here. Foosball, huh? Pizza box. Oh, a subscription to Playboy, my kind of woman.",
        "I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.",
        "Ah… Hey, so this roommate of yours…is he good looking?",
        "Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?",
        "No-no-no-no, he’s not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!",
        "Y’know what? Bring her both, and I’ll have the same. (The waitress leaves.)",
        "Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff. Okay? We’re on a date.",
        "No! No. Umm, just myself and if they don’t like me for—(Laughs.) I’m sorry I couldn’t even get through that.",
        "Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine sent to my table from a fan.",
        "Well it does when you combine it with, \"This is so embarrassing, I just want to have a normal life!\"",
        "Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you, but you’re so beautiful…I don’t think I can.",
        "Alright, so…so tell me one of your moves.",
        "That’s your move? Boy Rach, you’re lucky you’re hot.",
        "(exasperated) Queens.",
        "Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad.",
        "I don’t know. I guess there’s just always been this distance y’know—I mean we both try to pretend it’s not there, but it is.",
        "Yeah, it is. It’s really tough. Y’know sometimes I think—Wow!! Nice move!",
        "\"Where’d you grow up,\" it’s so simple!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yes I am! Again so simple!",
        "Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?",
        "Chandler?",
        "Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!",
        "I never laughed so hard—Did you see the wine come out of my nose?",
        "I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much.",
        "Huh. Huh.",
        "Ah! Okay, well then you don’t judge me. I’m gonna suck on the cellophane from the brownie I had before. (They both do as they planned.)",
        "Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips look irresistible.",
        "Now you can’t tell anyone, but uh…I put on shiny lip balm.",
        "Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I’m telling ya. Okay all right, so now you go.",
        "Why not?",
        "More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?! (Rachel just looks at him.) I didn’t say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, just tell me!",
        "(stunned and turned on) Yeah. Why—Yeah, that would work for ya…",
        "Oh. (She kisses him.) Yeah. (She goes into her room.) Me to. (He then starts to freak out.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh yeah, I still can’t believe you haven’t seen Cujo. What is wrong with you?",
        "Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane?",
        "Oh yeah? All right, let’s do it tonight.",
        "Oh right!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!",
        "Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.",
        "Yeah me too, all night.",
        "Yeah well that’s because uh…I stayed in my room. Yeah, you don’t want to look in my hamper.",
        "No-no! I’m fine. It’s just… Hey, can I ask you something? Have you ever looked at someone that you’ve known for a while and then suddenly…suddenly see them a different way?",
        "Yeah. Yeah, that…that’s exactly it. You’re right. Yeah.",
        "(deadpan) Ooh! Yeah. So yeah, so you know exactly what I’m talking about.",
        "Oh yeah, sure. (She gets up, walks towards the bathroom, and Joey watches her go.) Ehhh.",
        "(incredulous) Alone?!",
        "Hey, did you get to the part where they’re trapped in the car and Cujo’s throwin’ himself at the windshield?",
        "Oh uh, it didn’t work out.",
        "Oh uh, okay. Yeah.",
        "Oh sure, yeah, why not? (Sits on the arm of the chair.)",
        "All right, I know! I know. Yeah, it’ll be okay.",
        "Terrified. (But for a totally different reason.)",
        "(thinking) All right. It’s a new day. All that stuff about Rachel, you don’t feel that now. It was crazy! You’re fine. You’re better than fine! You are, as your friend Tony would say, Grrrreat! Everything’s normal! She’s just your friend Rachel! Your friend Rachel. Your friend! Rachel.",
        "(thinking) Hey, it’s your girlfriend, Rachel!",
        "(entering) Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? I-I really need to talk to you.",
        "Well, neither.",
        "I don’t know. It’s-it’s just…lately, I’ve been feeling… Okay, here’s what it is… (Pause) You know what? I feel a lot better, thanks! (Starts to leave)",
        "All right. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but that’s different. I mean, there are rules there, too! You know what I mean?",
        "It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me.",
        "Hey. Well, what’s up?",
        "What?",
        "Whaaat?",
        "Oh my God. You do?",
        "I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys. I mean, it’s Rachel for God sakes.",
        "I know. I know. And she’s not only my friend; she’s my pregnant friend! She’s my pregnant friend who’s Ross’ ex!",
        "What am I going to do? You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid of these feelings, y’know? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I don’t like about her. You want to hear it?",
        "She made me switch to light Mayo. That’s it! That’s all I got! And, you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!",
        "You think?",
        "Yeah, just a crush! That’s all this is! It’s a crush! I’m Joey; I don’t get deep feelings.",
        "Not really.",
        "(from outside the bathroom) Hello?",
        "Why?",
        "(entering the bathroom) What are you guys doing in here?",
        "It’s no big deal, okay? Phoebe and I talked about it. It’s just a crush! It’s going to go away! (Looks down) Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles! Oh!",
        "(thinking) All right. It’s a new day, and it’s just a crush, that’s all! Just a little crush! All that worrying I was doing, that was crazy. Crazy! Like my friend here the bird would say, \"it was cuckoo!\" Everything’s going to be fine. It’s just a crush.",
        "(thinking) I love you.",
        "Oh okay, okay! One more push! One more push! Come on honey, we’re almost there! We’re almost there!",
        "Oh, I love you too.",
        "That’s always appropriate! (Back to the matter at hand) Oh, okay. One more push! One more push!",
        "What? What’s going on?",
        "Aaaah…",
        "Really?!",
        "Oh, y’know what? Maybe uh, you…you should come to me. I’m a not, I’m not wearing any bottoms.",
        "Oh my, oh my God!",
        "Mia Hamm?",
        "Oh that’s amazing. (Drops the sheet.)",
        "Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!",
        "Hey Ross! The baby’s kicking!",
        "A dreamless sleep.",
        "Well I got stuff going on in here (Rubbing his belly) if you wanna feel.",
        "Wow! Can I get a copy of that?",
        "Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?",
        "Why not?",
        "I don’t know. Ooh, I bet it’s Richard.",
        "Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she’s having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!",
        "I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. Y’know it wouldn’t kill ya to respect your wife’s privacy! (He walks away and into his apartment and looks the door.) Stupid closet full of bugs!",
        "Oh hey whoa-whoa, don’t worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.",
        "Absolutely. But, we’re gonna stop by the hospital just to be sure, okay? I’ll page Ross on the way. Come on.",
        "Okay Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everything’s gonna be fine, trust me. Okay. Take my hand. Here we go. (Rachel grabs his hand.) Oww crushing bones!",
        "Hey! So?",
        "So but everything is normal.",
        "And-and there’s no danger to her and the baby?",
        "Calm?! I wasn’t calm! I’ve never been more scared in all my life!",
        "Well what do I know?! I’m not a doctor!",
        "You sure?!",
        "(seeing Ross) Oh hey-hey!",
        "Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.",
        "Hey uh, what’s with the candy?",
        "Oh hey, don’t worry about it man. Don’t worry about it, no big deal.",
        "Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy! (Grabs Ross around the shoulders.) He brought Twizlers!",
        "Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?",
        "Then why do you throw like one?",
        "Sure. \"Monica.\"",
        "Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now. (Chandler returns with a bobby pin and hands it to Joey.) Wow, you sure found that quick. (He tries the pin in the lock.) I just—I wish I didn’t feel this way about Rachel anymore, y’know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think…I think Ross feels left out. Y’know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God… You should’ve seen the look on Ross’s face. (Pause) By the way, I have no idea what I’m doing here. For all I know I’m just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, I just…I feel terrible.",
        "What’s going on?",
        "Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.",
        "I’m on it! (Takes a bite out of the sandwich.)",
        "Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.",
        "Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?",
        "Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.",
        "The thing is…’cause I live with Rachel I’m here for a lot of the stuff, okay? (To Rachel) And Ross…Ross is missing everything. So…",
        "Maybe you two should live together.",
        "Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems that…if you’re gonna have a roommate, y’know it might as well be the father.",
        "All right now, so? What do you think?",
        "Well, I was due.",
        "Hey.",
        "Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldn’t stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, it’s a couple weeks past it’s expiration date, so it’s got a bit of a kick.",
        "Are you kidding me? I’m great! Yeah, I’m uh; I’m better than great. I am good. And now that she’s gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff around here that I couldn’t do before. Y’know? Like umm, I can walk around naked again. Y’know? I can uh, I can watch p0rn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this is good for me. Y’know? I like being on my own, I’m uh, better off this way. I’m uh, a lone wolf. Y’know? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. What’s a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?! (Chandler rushes over and hugs him.)",
        "There’s this woman, that I like.  A lot.  Well, it’s complicated.  She’s with this other guy.  For a long time.  And I could never do that to the guy, y’know?  ’Ccause we’re really good friends.",
        "Yeah, he’s the best.",
        "Oh, I don’t know.",
        "I do! So much! I can’t stop thinking about her! I can’t sleep, I—",
        "It’s Rachel.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes. I like Rachel.",
        "(startled) Yeah, okay but look, buy uh—Hey-hey, y’know, y’know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn’t get said enough. I like you Ross.",
        "Yeah, but it’s not a big deal.",
        "I’m an actor, y’know? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.",
        "Look no, I-I know it’s bad, and I know it’s wrong. Okay? But-but it’s not like anything’s ever gonna happen. Y’know? These-these are just feelings, they’re gonna go away.",
        "Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don’t…",
        "Hey.",
        "Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.",
        "Oh what then? Kick me?",
        "(getting worried) Bite me?",
        "Oh now—Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?",
        "Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I don’t…",
        "(pouring two glasses) Hey look Ross, you need to understand something okay? I uh…I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you. (He hands Ross a glass.)",
        "Anyway, it uh…look it’ll just…take me a while to get over her, that’s all. I’m not even sure how to do that, I mean I’ve never been in love before so…",
        "Yeah, I thought you knew that.",
        "Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don’t want to feel this way. Honest. I just keep thinking, \"Ah, I’ll get over this.\" Y’know? I just—It just keeps gettin’ harder. I don’t, I don’t know what to do. Y’know? What do I do?",
        "Okay that’s the green stuff talkin’.",
        "But what if uh—and I’m not saying she will be—But…",
        "Are you sure?",
        "Hey thanks.",
        "Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven’t even thought about what I will say. What should I say?",
        "I’m sorry, you’re right. What am I gonna say? (He takes another sip of the green stuff and recoils at the taste.) Oh!",
        "Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand up straight. (Does so.) Take a couple deep breaths. (Does so.) Look confident. (Does so as Rachel opens the door and startles him.)",
        "I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.",
        "Here? In the hall? What are we animals?",
        "Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that I…want to have dinner with you tonight. That’s all.",
        "Okay. That’s good. Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what you’re gonna say. Good. Yeah. (Someone comes out of his apartment and it startles Joey again.) Don’t you people ever knock?!",
        "What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reason…(Exhales slowly)—Is it hot in here?",
        "I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbs.",
        "Yeah. Sure. (They both half stand up, Joey pulls the neck of his sweater out, and Rachel looks down it to see his T-shirt.)",
        "Uh… How long have we known each other?",
        "Uh-huh, long time.",
        "But over the past few weeks…",
        "Actually uh, could you give us a second?",
        "I’m not quite sure.",
        "Yeah, here we are. Uhh… I… I think I’m…falling in love with you.",
        "I’m falling in love with you.",
        "Does it really matter?",
        "Okay look Rach, I know this is a lot. You don’t have to say anything. You-you uh, you take as much time as you need. (Long pause as Rachel says nothing.) Okay, you gotta say something!",
        "But. (Hangs his head down.)",
        "Yeah-yeah right. That’s okay. That’s fine. That’s uh, pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, it’s no big deal. All right? I think I’m gonna go. (Stands up.)",
        "Don’t start doing that. You can’t do that Rach, ‘cause then you’re gonna make me do that. (Starts to cry.) Oh, here we go! (Sits down next to her.)",
        "Sure!",
        "Hey-hey-hey, hey! You can’t. Okay? Ever!",
        "Oh no-no Rach, please, don’t be sorry. Okay? Don’t be sorry. (They hug again.) Y’know I was only kidding you.",
        "(hearing Rachel and jumping up with his plate) Oh God! That’s Rachel!",
        "No-no, I can’t! I can’t! Not after the other night, it’s just it’s…too weird, okay? Don’t tell her I’m here! (Turns to run to the bathroom and his bagel falls off the plate onto the floor.) Don’t eat that! (Runs to the bathroom as Rachel enters.)",
        "Yeah, a naked bagel game? (Picks up his dropped bagel.) (To Chandler) Dude, I don’t know. That’s a pretty small hole.",
        "I can’t! Y’know? You guys don’t know what it’s like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.",
        "All right so, so what do I do?",
        "Yeah. Okay. (Goes to take a bite out of the previously mentioned bagel.) Whoa! (Stops.) I almost forgot this was on your…",
        "Hey.",
        "Hi.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "So you uh, have a…big work problem?",
        "Huh. Okay. (Awkward silence.) So uh, I think I’m gonna take off.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Yeah?",
        "What?! Oh my-oh my God!",
        "What he wants to buy your baby?!",
        "That’s crazy!",
        "Okay, how did this even happen?",
        "Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured it was something about maternity leave.",
        "Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Not a problem. Oh, and just so you know, that guy’s not going to be bothering you about that baby thing anymore.",
        "Let’s just say I took care of it.",
        "Don’t worry! Don’t worry. I just told him, very nicely, \"You don’t go buying people’s babies, so back off!!\"",
        "What?! Why?!",
        "And you couldn’t think of anything else?!",
        "You lied to me!",
        "So? What-what-what happened?",
        "I know. I know.",
        "Hey you’re right. Yeah, it’s kinda been like us again a little bit.",
        "Me too. I mean I…haven’t thought at all about how I put myself out there and said all that stuff and how you didn’t feel the same way about me and-and how it was really awkward.",
        "Hey, so, uh, how’s it going living over at Ross’?",
        "Bye.",
        "There’s one lucky to-go cup of coffee.",
        "Thanks. But maybe later.",
        "You know what I want? I want a lot of things! I want to be with the woman I love on Valentine’s Day! And I want her to love me back! And I want just one moment of relief from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing that that’s never going to happen!",
        "Oh, okay.",
        "No, I’m not sleeping with your friend Jane again.",
        "Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane.",
        "Thanks so much, Pheebs! (to the dog) We are going to have so much fun, yes we are! (the dog sticks his head between Joey’s legs) Oh! Not that kind of fun.",
        "Get the ball, ready? Get the ball, get the ball! (Joey pretends to throw it, but really doesn’t, and the dog goes running off.) Well, you’re cute, but you’re not too smart!",
        "(looking at the ball the dog brought back) Did I just throw this?",
        "Hi.",
        "Oh, that’s, uh, that’s Phoebe’s friend’s dog. I don’t know what his real name is, but I call him Mozzarella.",
        "(to the dog) C’mere. Hey. C’mere. That’s Rachel. She’s the one who used to live here. Might as well be honest with you—we love her. But we can’t have her. I really miss her. Well, hey, you understand, right? You’re a guy. (thinks about it and picks up the dog and looks) Well, you used to be.",
        "So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isn’t going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat.",
        "Hey.",
        "No.",
        "Yeah, sure. Go ahead. (pause) Oh, me, right!",
        "Nothing. We just talked about stuff.",
        "Rachel stuff.",
        "He’s breathing!",
        "No, no, no, no! He’s fine! Look, look, look! (picks up the ball) Here’s your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! (he throws the ball and it bounces right next to the dog) Get your ball! My God, what have I done to you, huh? I broke the dog! Pheebs, I broke the dog!",
        "Hey, what’s up?",
        "Oh, man, I’m sorry. Why?",
        "Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentine’s Day.",
        "Sort of.",
        "You don’t have to seem so happy about it.",
        "Oh, I…I d—",
        "Forget about it. It’s no big deal.",
        "It’s nothing.",
        "Okay, uh…sit down. (they do) Um… there’s this woman that I like. A lot. But, uh…it can’t happen.",
        "No!",
        "Yes.",
        "Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesn’t matter, because I can’t do anything about it.",
        "Well, it’s complicated. She’s with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because we’re really good friends.",
        "No. I don’t think so.",
        "Yeah, he’s the best.",
        "Oh, I don’t know.",
        "I do! So much! I can’t stop thinking about her! I can’t sleep, I—",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "It’s Rachel.",
        "So, who’s the guy?",
        "Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying. (Points to himself) I’m an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue. (snaps fingers)",
        "Are you kidding me? Watch! (Makes funny faces trying to cry) Well I can’t do it with you guys watching me!",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah, yeah, in honor of their 35th wedding anniversary, I had a star named after them.",
        "And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.",
        "I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don’t want him complimenting my thing.",
        "I know",
        "Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were being jerks. Parker’s a nice guy and I’d like to get to know him.",
        "Why?",
        "What-what?",
        "I know I’m having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!",
        "I guess it could’ve been, I didn’t really look at it. Y’know, I just wiped it on Chandler’s coat and got the hell out of there.",
        "Oh hey, you should be excited about him. There’s nothing wrong with him he’s a good guy.",
        "Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.",
        "Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.",
        "Nothing…",
        "(reading) Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani. That’s me!! I’m blank!!",
        "Yeah you are baby.",
        "No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no.",
        "Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.",
        "Fine! All right, I’ll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y’know, start to say something stupid.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, not at all. Happy to do it.",
        "(laughs) Actually, I didn’t know the magazine was paying for it. Wouldn’t have mattered, I’m doing this for the fans, not for the free food.",
        "And I’ll have all the muffins.",
        "(He goes into a song and dance number)",
        "Oh, you said it Mike. (Rips open the carton and spills milk on the counter) Aw! There's got to be a better way!",
        "(finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is easy. (Starts to poor the milk) Now, I can have milk everyday.",
        "Yeah, I guess it is. And so… I’m gonna get on this spaceship, (Smoke starts pouring in from the ceiling, and a ladder comes down, with flashing, colored lights on the side of it) and I’m gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you’ll be long gone. But I won’t have aged at all. (Gets on the ladder) So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne… baby…I’m gonna want to meet her.",
        "Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do…so I just watch 'em have s*x. And then I say, wait, here's my line, (Joey from TV) you know that's bad for the paper tray.",
        "Thank you. Wait-wait-wait-wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am…",
        "Well, there are so many things, it’s hard to pick just one.",
        "(drinking a beer) Look at this clown! Just because he’s got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. (Yelling) Get out of the way jackass! (To Rachel) Who names their boat Coast Guard anyway?",
        "What are they doing out here? The coast’s all the way over there. (Points to the coast.)",
        "(To Chandler) Dude! What are yo—you trying to kill me?!",
        "Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!",
        "I think you’re right.",
        "One.",
        "That’s kinda nice.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah!!",
        "In my spare time I uh, read to the blind. And I’m also a mento for the kids.(The gang shake their heads.) Y’know a mento, a role model. (Chandler bites his fist to keep from talking.)",
        "Right.",
        "Matter of fact, I do.",
        "Uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise.",
        "Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?",
        "Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! (Checks his pants.) Yeah, my pants are a little loose!",
        "Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since. But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious.",
        "No way! ‘Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! (Rolls over and shows Chandler.) Why did I have to start working out again? (Looks at the weights he was using.) Damn you 15s!",
        "I like it.",
        "What’s not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Goooooood.",
        "The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes—Hey, what was in that brown jar?",
        "Not anymore.",
        "(pulls out a fork) All right, what are we havin’? (Starts digging in.)",
        "Uhh, I don’t believe in these crazy diets y’know, just everything in moderation.",
        "I’ll take those to go. (To the interviewer) For the kids.",
        "It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn’t have said. But believe me, that’s not gonna happen today.",
        "Well, I said that I… (The gang jumps up and interrupts him.)",
        "You guys, this is Shelley, she’s interviewing me for Soap Opera Digest, and Shelley, this are my friends…",
        "Okay.",
        "No thanks.",
        "How come you have two?",
        "Get out.",
        "Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.",
        "No that’s all right. Don’t worry about it.",
        "Rach! Hey! It’s fine! You’re at Joey’s!",
        "Yeah! Look! (He throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.)",
        "I know.",
        "All right, don’t waste it, I mean its still food. (He picks it up and eats it.)",
        "Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.",
        "All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. (He removes the waste bucket that's over the duck and the laundry basket that's over the chicken.) And they're off! (He puts his foot in front of the chick, stopping it from moving.)",
        "Judge rules, no violation.",
        "And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!",
        "Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I’d seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...",
        "That’s right I stepped up! She’s my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I’d pee on anyone of you!",
        "Umm, no. No best friend, no. Just a lot of close friends.",
        "Really? Me? Wow! I don’t even know any huge gay people!",
        "What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!",
        "I think face to face.",
        "Face to face, yeah!",
        "All right.",
        "(grunting) Oh my… How much do you weigh Ross?!",
        "Y’know, when we talked about face to face, I don’t think we thought it all the way through.",
        "Hey Pheebs! (He sits down next to her.)",
        "Check it out. (He turns around, pulls down his pants, and shows Phoebe that he’s got panties on.) How much of a man am I?!",
        "No I’m not. Why would you say that? That’s just mean.",
        "It’s not what you said. It’s the way you said it… Oh My God, I’m a woman!!!",
        "Great nap.",
        "Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are. (Chandler and Ross look at each other.)",
        "Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, \"Hey, how you doin’?\"",
        "(to Phoebe) Hey, how you doin’?",
        "Hey! How you doin’?",
        "I’d love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She’s sleeping. (The women both laugh) Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (Just then the same guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapses it. It turns out that Joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a Porsche.)",
        "Hey, (in the Joey voice) how you doin’?",
        "Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.",
        "Oh, I do. (Gives her the Joey-love look.) How you doin?",
        "What?!?! Oh dear God!",
        "Not much to tell there I’m really shy.",
        "Oh great! Great! Thank you. (They shake hands.)",
        "Bye-bye. (The interviewer leaves and he sits down with the rest of the gang.) I did it!",
        "Oh, I don’t watch soap operas. Excuse me, I have a life, y’know?",
        "Oh, good to know. (The interviewer leaves.) So close!",
        "Yeah, I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking. She was pretty nice about that.",
        "Little bit, yeah.",
        "Oh yeah, that’s just a little something for my huge gay fan base. (Winks at him.)",
        "Hey, you’re the one that loves the picture.",
        "Man, this is bad! And I’ve had my share of bad reviews. I still remember my first good one though. (Quoting) \"Everything else in this production of Our Town was simply terrible. Joey Tribbiani was abysmal.\"",
        "Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me, okay? And I’m not just saying this because I’m your friend, I’m sayin’ it ‘cause it’s the truth. You’re food is abysmal!",
        "(entering) Hey uh Monica, I can’t remember. Did we say we were gonna meet here or at the movies?",
        "Okay, I’ll see you there. (Starts to leave)",
        "Sure, I can hang out ‘til I have to meet ya. (To Chandler) What uh—How come you’re not going?",
        "I thought you already have a job.",
        "Wow! How do you know how to do that?!",
        "What is it?",
        "You cooked him?",
        "Either eat it, or be in it.",
        "Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; there’s a new class comin’ in.",
        "Hi.",
        "When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?",
        "Cheese makes me thirsty.",
        "All right.",
        "I can an A? In-in school? (To Joey) Hey, I’m a dork.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I don’t want to go. I’m having fun.",
        "Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says it’s time to go, it’s time to go. (Starts to leave, but comes back for his cookies.)",
        "Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, that’s the first A I’ve gotten since seventh grade, and I didn’t have to sleep with the teacher this time.",
        "What the hell!",
        "Yeah, this was a stupid idea. (Exits.)",
        "Oh no, I can’t go. I’m practicing; I got an audition to be the host of a new game show.",
        "Yeah-yeah, and if I get it by day I’ll (In a sexy voice) Dr. Drake Remoray, but by night I’ll be (In an announcer’s voice) Joey Trrrribbiani!",
        "But the audition’s in a couple hours and I don’t even understand the game.",
        "Oh really? That’d be great! You guys can be the contestants!",
        "(announcer voice) All right! Let’s play Bamboozled!",
        "Yeah, isn’t that a cool name?",
        "All right. Uhh, okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why don’t you tell us a little something about you Ross?",
        "I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?",
        "Excellent! Let’s play Bamboozled! Chandler, you’ll go first. What is the capital of Columbia?",
        "It’s Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.",
        "I should know that. Let’s see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.",
        "This is embarrassing. (Looks it up.)",
        "All right Ross you’re in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?",
        "Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.",
        "No dude, you gotta hold your breath until you’re ready to answer the question.",
        "Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, Tris…Holy cow, that’s a big word. Trisc… Seriously look at this thing. Chandler, how do you say that?",
        "This one right here. (Ross whines.)",
        "No! No, fear of the number 13.",
        "All right Chandler, you’re up.",
        "All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.",
        "You-you must choose Mr. Bing.",
        "Choose, you jackass!",
        "Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross’s points!",
        "(To Chandler) In what John Houston film would you hear this line, \"Badges? We don’t need no stinkin’ badges!\"",
        "Correct! There’s a possible backwards bonus!",
        "Yes!",
        "Wise choice, how many rungs?",
        "(makes a sound like a monkey) That noise can only me one thing.",
        "Okay, it’s an audio question, name this television theme song. (Starts humming the theme to I Dream of Genie.)",
        "Yes! Yes, you’re back in the lead!",
        "All right! All right! Uh, umm, Super-Speedy Speed round!",
        "Of course!",
        "Who invented bifocals?",
        "Correct! Which monarch has ruled Great Britain the longest?",
        "Correct again! But, you forgot to switch legs between questions, so no hopping bonus!",
        "Now, over to Chandler.",
        "Are you sure?",
        "Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, you’ve been Bamboozled!",
        "(announcer voice) It’s a pleasure to meet you Ray.",
        "(announcer voice) Rightie-O Ray!",
        "(to the camera) Hello, I’m Joey Tribbiani! Let’s play Bamboozled! Erin, you get the first question! In hockey, who is known as The Great One?",
        "Correct! Now, would you like to pick a Wicked Wango card or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?",
        "What—Why?!",
        "Well what’s complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey; you yank his tail and boom! You’re in Paradise Pond!",
        "Well what’s fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring game that’s just people standing around answering questions?",
        "(announcer voice to the camera) Let’s play Bamboozled!",
        "Oh, it’s a poster for that World War I movie that I’m in, check it out.",
        "Uh-huh! I know. I’m coming soon to a theater near you! I’m in THX! I’m unsuitable for children!",
        "Yeah, yeah, it’s already generating Oscar buzz.",
        "I thought I did! Oh hey guess what? The premiere is next week and you’re all invited! (They all gasp.)",
        "Sure! Why not?!",
        "Hello?",
        "One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!",
        "Oh my God. So that’s it?! I only get to bring one guest?",
        "(to Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe) Did you hear that? I only get one extra ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.",
        "You said you didn’t want to go.",
        "Definitely not invisible.",
        "Well uh…I think I want to take Chandler.",
        "Yeah! Yeah! I mean I’m sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but y’know Chandler always supported my career. He’s paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.",
        "It’s not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it’s-it’s everything. Y’know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn’t get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didn’t believe in myself.",
        "Thanks. That means a lot to me.",
        "(in a manly voice) I’m gonna go shave. (Gets up.)",
        "A little tall.",
        "Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller? (Chandler does so) There you go. (And they walk down the red carpet.)",
        "(onscreen) \"I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along.\"",
        "(To Chandler) Okay, this is it. It’s my big fight scene coming up. (He looks over and Chandler and notices that he’s asleep.)",
        "You liked it? You really liked it?",
        "Which part exactly?",
        "Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.",
        "Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?",
        "You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didn’t take any of my suggestions! That’s for coming buddy. I’ll see you later. (Starts to walk out.)",
        "Hey! Sleeping beauty!",
        "(in a baby voice) Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?",
        "Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us! Okay? You’ve done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?",
        "Give me a number, I don’t want to owe you anything!",
        "Ah-ah-ah! We’re doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. Right, how much were those?",
        "Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?",
        "Okay, so that’s another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred, that’s… (Pauses to figure it out.)",
        "Please!",
        "All right, what else?",
        "Which we’re still keeping under our hats!",
        "What the hell are you talking about, (in a Jamaican accent) \"The south will rise again man.\"",
        "Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!",
        "Okay. Okay, so I’m writing you a check for…So you fell asleep during my movie. Big deal right? How do you clear this thing?",
        "Uh… Look Rach…(Ross enters.) Hey Ross is here! Hey look! It’s my good friend Ross. Hey Ross.",
        "Hey and look he brought flowers. Thanks Ross, but I’m really more of a candy guy. (Laughs.)",
        "No.",
        "Oh, I’m sorry. I meant no.",
        "Oh hey but, before you guys do that (To Rachel) I need to talk to you, and Ross, I need to talk to you.",
        "(taking Chandler aside) Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?",
        "Dude I just did something terrible.",
        "No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!",
        "Because it kinda looked like I did.",
        "Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand…",
        "It wasn’t my ring! It fell out of Ross’s jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!",
        "I guess.",
        "I know! I know it’s awful.",
        "(happily) She said yes.",
        "Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?",
        "Oh, I like that. Yeah…",
        "(laughs) Now let’s not get carried away. (He walks away as Monica comes over and hugs Chandler from behind.)",
        "(entering) Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y’know what? I’ll-I’ll come back later. (He goes to leave but runs into Ross who’s entering.)",
        "It can’t be me, I’m standing right here.",
        "(To Ross) We’re not peeking? (Follows him.)",
        "Hey uh, is it okay to come in?",
        "Yeah uh look Rach, there’s something I gotta tell ya.",
        "(watching) Yowsa! (Looks away.)",
        "Dear Lord.",
        "Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that…",
        "Y’know, I don’t really know her.",
        "(To God) Are you kidding me?!",
        "I don’t know! Maybe she’s crazy! (Storms out.)",
        "No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.",
        "I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of it.",
        "Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I don’t want to hurt her.",
        "You’re right. You’re right. I-I’ll go tell her now before Ross finds out and I’ll be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the way. Two people screwing in there (Points to the closet Chandler and Monica were in) if you want to check that out.",
        "I can come back.",
        "No.",
        "Actually, technically, I didn’t.",
        "No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!",
        "No, I didn’t!",
        "No, I didn’t!",
        "Ahhh!",
        "Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didn’t…I didn’t propose!",
        "Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing.",
        "No, I didn’t!",
        "No, I didn’t!",
        "Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!",
        "(To Ross) I’ll tell you about it later. Be cool.",
        "It wasn’t my ring! It’s Ross’s ring! That’s why I felt so bad Rach, because he was going to propose.",
        "Well, this is awkward. {See? I told you so.}",
        "Dude, step up! I proposed.",
        "Oh that’s right. There’s a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.",
        "I can’t believe you’re not going to propose!",
        "Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a woman I like to slow things down!",
        "(looking at the ceiling) Ah, it’s beautiful.",
        "Y’know what you guys? I’m uh, I’m gonna go too. And uh, I’m sorry about everything.",
        "No, Rach, I should’ve told you sooner. It’s just that…Man! That kid is going to town! (Joey makes his awkward exit.)",
        "Hey! You made it!",
        "You’re ready to have a baby? My boy’s all grown up!",
        "(voice all high and weird) What?! Are you crazy?!",
        "God. He’s crazy! Why doesn’t he want to be with Rachel?",
        "I mean seriously, she’s like the perfect woman. I mean I know she turned me down, but if she hadn’t and wanted to be with me, I would take her in my arms and… (Realizes everyone is staring.) I haven’t bummed you guys out like this in a while have I?",
        "Come on you stupid machine! Come on!",
        "(looking at her) No.",
        "All right.",
        "Hey I got one! I got one!",
        "(standing behind her) Uh, you gotta press the button. (Does so.)",
        "(walks up) Uh, she’s with me. (Introduces himself) Dr. Drake Remoray.",
        "Remoray. It’s Portuguese. We need that information; I’m a doctor.",
        "Damnit woman we’re losing precious time! Now do you want this man’s blood on your head?",
        "Hands! It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in. He’s a patient of mine, I’ve been treating him for years!",
        "816, thank you!",
        "And what is his name?",
        "Great! Go get him.",
        "(looks in the window) He’s not really my type.",
        "But you said he was this great guy!",
        "You do attract some stinkers.",
        "Hi! I’m Dr. Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.",
        "I know, but I’m a neurologist. And just to be on the safe side, Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me.",
        "That was a test. Good response. All right, full name.",
        "Date of birth?",
        "Age?",
        "I’m a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician.",
        "Okay. And uh, are you married.",
        "Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment issues?",
        "(checking the list) Yes.",
        "Oh that’s terrible. I’m-I’m really sorry.",
        "Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?",
        "Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff y’know, sexually?",
        "Oooh, wrong answer. (Exits.)",
        "Uh, well he’s 33.",
        "A widower.",
        "He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh, and he’s not into anything weird sexually.",
        "(entering) Rachel’s having her baby!! (Phoebe turns and looks at him.) Which is of no interest to me, I’m a neurologist.",
        "Fake? Excuse me? Hello? (Taps the TV screen.)",
        "Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right? And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal stuff about her. Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh, she gave birth to her brother’s triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do p0rn!",
        "Right!",
        "Me neither.",
        "There she is!",
        "(taking the baby) She looks so real! (The gang looks at him.) Y’know what I mean! She’s this whole tiny little person. She already has eyelashes and knees and…uh-oh.",
        "Oh no-no, no for I second there I counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand so we’re good.",
        "What’s the matter now?",
        "What was the other one Ross?",
        "Hey. I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here. (Notices she’s wiping her eyes.) What’s the matter?",
        "What is it? Hey!",
        "Rach come on, what?",
        "What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?",
        "Okay, how long was I watching that woman?",
        "Yeah, I guess so.",
        "Hey, listen to me, listen to me…you are never ever gonna be alone. Okay? I promise that’s not gonna happen.",
        "You don’t have to worry about that okay?",
        "Sure.",
        "My God.",
        "(Enters) Hey you guys I’m gonna take off. I just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye.",
        "(He looks around the room) This isn’t the right room, sorry folks. (leaves)",
        "Why’re you so tired?",
        "You know what you should’ve done, you should have told yourself that little story.",
        "Hey so where’s Ross?",
        "Is he still mad at us?",
        "That’s not fair! I can’t do that.",
        "See this is what I was afraid of, I didn’t think I should be here either but somebody (Looks at Chandler) said he’d be over it by now.",
        "(entering) Hey. (Ross turns to see who it is, and seeing it’s Joey he just ignores him and turns back around.) Ross, I know you’re pissed at me, but we have to talk about this.",
        "Fine, fine okay. But I gotta say technically, I didn’t even do anything wrong.",
        "I said I didn’t technically.",
        "Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this (Makes quote marks with his fingers.) I don’t really know what that means. (Ross just looks at him) You were saying?",
        "I know I should’ve. (Makes quote marks again.) \"I’m sorry.\"",
        "No, come on Ross! (He grabs his bag so he can’t leave) Look, Ross, we have to get past this.",
        "No, look, I don’t know what else to do. I said I’m sorry!",
        "You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me.",
        "Why not? You’ll feel better! I’ll feel better, and you know you want to. I can see it in your eyes.",
        "A little bit.",
        "Little bit.",
        "(excited) A little bit more.",
        "No, hit me",
        "Hit me.",
        "Hit me!",
        "(interrupting) Hit me, hit me.",
        "(shouts) Hit me! Hit me!",
        "I’m sorry! It was a reflex!",
        "I couldn’t help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look! (He goes to punch Ross, expecting him to duck, but he doesn’t and Joey punches Ross. Gunther is amused.)",
        "You were supposed to duck!!! Why didn’t you duck?",
        "Good, good yeah, (Grabs the bags) maybe while we’re there, they can check your reflexes. (Joey opens the door and it hits Ross in the face with it.) (Makes quote marks.) \"Oops.\"",
        "Hey, so how is it?",

Because of this stupid thing (Points to her wedding ring.)\nChandler: There is nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh?\nJoey: Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa.

I liked that better than the law thing, so...\nJoey: Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to Mike.\nMary Ellen: I thought you thought he was still a lawyer.\nJoey: No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail.",
        "You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.\nJoey: Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out.

And just to be clear, I didn't hit his mother with a car.\nPhoebe: (To Joey) You are unbelievable! I spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and cute and loose.\nMary Ellen: Hey!\nPhoebe: Who are you kidding? (To Joey) You just find some guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!\nJoey: Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like this guy I can find you a better one. (Looks around) Mike!!

They nod then put their ears back to the phone. Joey walks out of his apartment and up to Monica’s door] Right, look. If you can’t come home and deal with this, then I'm gonna…",
        "I just heard him!",
        "No. Right, I’m going in!",
        "I heard him again!",
        "Great. I’ll see you when you get here. I’m gonna wait out in the hall in case the dude comes out.",
        "Absolutely. You’d do it for me! Not that you’d ever have to, ‘cos I know how to keep my women completely satisfied.",
        "Wow, that didn’t take long. I thought you said Tulsa was a three-hour flight?",
        "Alright, alright. Then maybe you won’t mind if me and my friend takes a look around then. Huh! Where you at?",
        "Bedroom’s clear, although you might need some new pillows.",
        "Why do I smell men’s cologne?",
        "Oh yeah, I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.",
        "I guess not.",
        "You’re right, Monica. I’m so sorry.",
        "Wait, wait, wait a minute. If you’ve just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?",
        "What’s going on?",
        "What? You think I’m too dumb to know that a husband needs to be with his wife? Uh? You think I’m like, duhhh! [Taps head with baseball bat – it hurts him]",
        "Yeah?",
        "You could go to the game with me, even though I know you said you couldn’t, but then you lied to me, tricked me and gave me a bump on the head.",
        "[Looking sad] Alright.",
        "Thanks, here’s ya ticket.",
        "Okay.",
        "Thanks, man. [They walk down the hall. Chandler looks at his ticket. Turns around and heads back to his apartment.] Where ya going?",
        "(impressed) Wow, that was great! You really wrote that?",
        "I *love* my job.",
        "Rach, these are for you.",
        "No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.",
        "They're ribbed for *your* pleasure.",
        "Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma?",
        "Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it's a Christmas miracle!",
        "Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?",
        "Got ya. (blinks an eye)",
        "Mine's is to Lilian Myers.",
        "(To Gunther who comes over with coffee and a muffin) Thank you!",
        "Okay.",
        "Pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry Italian?",
        "If you want I could loan you some money?",
        "Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?",
        "Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need.",
        "Okay, now. I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think.",
        "No it is awesome!",
        "She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?",
        "Yes you are. I think it may be time for my sponge bath. Sorry, I'm just so used to hitting on the extras. So, are you excited about your scene?",
        "Oh, relax. Don't be. You'll be fine, you'll be fine. They'll probably just make you stand in the back.",
        "Hey, you know what? Don't worry, Pheebs! It usually takes me three takes too! (Off the director's look) Alright, eight.",
        "Hey.",
        "Well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so I'm gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word \"puppy.\" Okay, so he said: \"If your puppy friend doesn't get\nher puppy act together, I'm gonna fire her mother-puppy ass.\"",
        "That's right, you're not. You're a nurse. You're Nurse With Tray.",
        "No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she\ndoesn't, people die!",
        "(Points to man on operating table) Man With Eye Patch! You get in there and you do your job.",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay.",
        "Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress.",
        "Nice.",
        "No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight.",
        "He slept with you and then never called you.",
        "Oh, calm down! She means on the show! We need some new extras around here!",
        "Please don't fire my friend. Just let me talk to her.",
        "Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?",
        "Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, you just wait on the tables?",
        "You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.",
        "What?",
        "(To the director) Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she won't go easy.",
        "Hey. So where's Mon?",
        "And you're not helping?",
        "You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.",
        "Yeah, you too.",
        "How do you think she's doing?",
        "Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.",
        "Sure.",
        "Why not?",
        "So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? (thinks about it) Yeah, sounds about right.",
        "Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more!",
        "Yes!",
        "Fine. (looks around, then focuses on Monica)",
        "For a walk.",
        "Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.",
        "Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta see her!",
        "Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me! She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?",
        "Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.",
        "Fine ... mediocre p0rn",
        "Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?",
        "Oh ... (Starts to sing) Happy birth ... (sees Molly leaving) oh, see you later (runs after Molly)",
        "So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.",
        "Oh, I didn't go to college.",
        "Molly ... people don't study acting ...",
        "(upset) Will the stable boy never get the princess??",
        "No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real? (pause) Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.",
        "Ok (admits)",
        "It's like my favorite fairy tale come true! (Chandler looks at him) The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!",
        "Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks I",
        "On...?",
        "Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!",
        "Oh man! I have to get those done too?!",
        "Hey hey! You dye your hair!",
        "Arghhh! Double standards!",
        "Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.",
        "Chandler Bing.",
        "OK Thanks.",
        "Thanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here?",
        "Oh good...",
        "All right let's just do this.",
        "Please I have an extremely high threshold...Holly Mother Of God! My face! My face!! I'm all right! I'm all right!",
        "Hey, I need your help.",
        "Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my eyebrows shaped",
        "You may be a sissy but I'll still (pound you out on ground). All right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do one",
        "All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one so",
        "What the hell am I supposed to do!",
        "What, what.",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help, but Chandler I don’t know if I can take anymore",
        "Oh my God! I didn’t feel a thing ! Hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles around",
        "Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look great! How you doing!",
        "Thank you so much.",
        "Listen that’s a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it.",
        "Comb my eyelashes.",
        "Hey!",
        "Ha, oh, of course.",
        "Your eyebrows look weird.",
        "Morning, roomie!",
        "Fifth day's a charm.",
        "Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?",
        "She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.",
        "No, hey, it's been great.",
        "Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump...",
        "Wow! So, how are you?",
        "Really?",
        "Well, actually it...",
        "Wow, really?",
        "Sure, I know lots of girls. ",
        "Ooh, names?",
        "Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?",
        "I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.",
        "Why are they doing this?",
        "You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here?",
        "I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed.",
        "Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.",
        "Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck! But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom.",
        "I know; that just pushes them further and further apart. ",
        "Ooh, that's a great plan! ",
        "Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh...",
        "Hey.",
        "All right! Who is he?",
        "She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher! ",
        "Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?",
        "Oh my god, you're right! ",
        "She even reads for pleasure!",
        "What? I'm not allowed to know smart women? ",
        "I met her at the library. I went in to pee.",
        "Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.",
        "Ooh...I hear that's bad. ",
        "Ah, yes, The Plan! (Laughs loudly again, but he sounds more like Santa Claus.)",
        "Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.",
        "Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together.",
        "Hello?",
        "Emma? Hey! Hi!",
        "How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the bedroom door closed?",
        "You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!",
        "Because you two were having s*x!",
        "Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair. (To Chandler.) You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?",
        "Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have s*x with Emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this. ",
        "Hey, I gotta! Unless...",
        "Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.",
        "Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name.",
        "(BEAT) (Laughs.) You almost had me.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "It's easy, you just walk in on them having s*x.",
        "We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding.",
        "Where?",
        "Can you believe they're still not here?",
        "I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?",
        "We've been stood up. (sniffles) And we want our free crab cakes.",
        "Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?!",
        "Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'. ",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Where's Chandler? I wanna wish him good luck on his first day. (Monica smiles) ... and I smelled bacon. (taking some)",
        "(puzzled) Who did? (Monica looks bewildered)",
        "(standing up, surprised) She did?",
        "(still surprised) I did?",
        "I don't know, but it sounds great. ",
        "With Lennart Haze?",
        "Oh my god, that is great! That is *** for a play on broadway… and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time.",
        "Well, it must be, because I read and I didn't understand a singe word. ",
        "Yeah, yeah, and directing.",
        "(pointing at Monica, a look of recognition in their faces) Ah!",
        "Yeah, he's done some amazing works.",
        "(almost laughing) I know. When the monkey hits him in the face with that giant rubber phone. (They all laugh)",
        "(sitting down) Don't make me more nervous than I already am!",
        "It is so amazing to meet you. (They are shaking hands) I'm such a big fan of your work.",
        "Tell me about it! \"Unlimited nights and weekends!\" ",
        "No, I-I-I wasn't making fun of you, honestly, I-I think you were great in those commercials. ",
        "Yeah.",
        "(regaining confidence) Are you kiddin'? When they shoot you out of that cannon…",
        "Wow!",
        "Oh, yah, sure.",
        "Err, \"I think you know\". ",
        "\"I am what you made me. You know what? I could go right now.\"",
        "\"I can't. Oh, I want to, long pause, but I can't.\"",
        "(understandingly) Oh, oh, I thought that was your character's name, you know, I thought you were like an Indian or something, you know with a… (He mimes wearing a feather on his head)",
        "Ah, y-y-you're sure you don't want me to do it again? I could do it with an accent, you know, Southern (He speaks in what he believes is a Southern accent) \"I could go right now, maaan!\"",
        "(interrupting their conversation) Ah, hi, ah. Thank you so much for whispering for my benefit, but, ah, look, if you just tell me what I did wrong, I'd just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you. And, and also: (to Producer #1) 'How you doing?' (to Lennart again) You should, please, just gimme another chance. I really wanna get better, please. ",
        "Yeah.",
        "I really doubt that. ",
        "(suggesting) Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?",
        "Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me. (He sits down) ",
        "Well, he said I wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh, and he said that I should think less.",
        "Wooooooooow (He takes the sneaker) It's like they're on fire!",
        "(determined) I give you $ 500 for them!",
        "Hey, that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords? ",
        "(entering) I know, I'm sorry, but can I just have a quick second to run to the bathroom?",
        "But I'm bursting with u-hu!",
        "Actually, I really need…",
        "Yes… ahahaaa (He seems to be in pain)",
        "(walking on the spot) \"I think you know!\" ",
        "\"I am what you made me! You know what?\"",
        "\"I could go right now.\" ",
        "(urgent) \"I, oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!\"",
        "(disbelieving) I did? ",
        "Sure, yeah. I don't have time to say thank you because I really gotta go. (He grabs his jacket and limps out of the room)",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Probably wanna know what I'm doing…?",
        "Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!",
        "We gotta get more of that. (He leaves the apartment)",
        "(hoping frantically on the spot, screaming) \"I need an answer!\"",
        "\"You know!\"",
        "\"I need an answer now!\" ",
        "(screaming) Oh!",
        "\"You knew this all along and you never told me? You never told me? I can never forgive you, I can never forgive myself, I have nothing to live for – Bang – End Scene!\"",
        "(in pain) Oh thanks, thanks! Now, I really have to get…",
        "(talking to a pineapple in his hand) God, you're beautiful...why are we fighting this?You know you want it to happen as much as I do.",
        "I want you.I need you.Let me make love to you.",
        "Oh, ehm...I'm...I'm rehearsing my lines.They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. It's the first time my character's got one. I'm so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good!",
        "Yeah, that was a disappointment...(pause) Oh, hey!D'you want to come down to the set and tell me if I'm doing ok?",
        "Yeah!Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again.",
        "Right!(he starts to ape her)\"Oh my God, is this the men's room? Oh, I feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor?\" (he inclines his head as if to look at a man's private parts)",
        "I don't know, but one of the extras sure did! (pause) Hey, listen Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!",
        "Also so gay!",
        "Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely gay stuff!",
        "Oh, wish me luck!",
        "Rach, I gotta say...if you weren't here wondering if these guys were gay I don't know if I could do this!",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me!",
        "Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me?",
        "Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.",
        "Right... (pause) ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.",
        "What?",
        "Ah, Rach, it doesn't say that!",
        "but, but..",
        "Hey!",
        "(Touches the back of his head and licks his fingers) Oh man! I thought I got it all!",
        "I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?",
        "And I couldn't find this little plastic thing (holds up plastic thing) that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very!",
        "What?",
        "Oh...I don't think it's going very well...",
        "Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...",
        "A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.",
        "So...I've never played that!",
        "Uh...well...just once...with you...",
        "(looks at her for a moment) What the hell are you talking about??",
        "(approvingly) Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.",
        "Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? (In a romantic voice) And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful... (Rachel looks very moved) and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you (pauses, while looking at her with sentiment) but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.",
        "(excited) Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! (leaves Rachel very touched on the couch and goes into his room)",
        "Hey!",
        "I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is my best friend, it would be wrong. Good...(He winks)...But wrong.",
        "Aww, I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always a mistake.",
        "And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.",
        "Oh...how much?",
        "Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?",
        "That's right I am! (Opens drawer and rummages through it. Rachel enters)",
        "Oo...what's in the bag?",
        "Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when I was a kid it was like.. \"Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!\" or er.. \"Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!\" Huh!",
        "You're gonna do it?",
        "Oh, women can. You can't.",
        "The hardware store is right down the street.",
        "Hey!",
        "I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.",
        "Yeah, I know.",
        "Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and the economy is bad.",
        "(to himself) That's the fastest I have ever thought!",
        "Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?",
        "Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your rent is. (shrugs)",
        "(To himself) I am on fire!",
        "Err... Kind of.",
        "Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems, it was for something for her.",
        "Something personal.",
        "Boob job.",
        "Well it's...It's not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would be crazy.",
        "Rach?! (He walks over to the fridge to put it in, but it cannot be opened either) Rachel!!!!? (He walks to the bathroom and tries to lift the toilet seat cover. It won't come up.) So I can't do anything I like????",
        "Because she is!",
        "Mmmm hmm! For your boob job!",
        "OK so I'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?",
        "Hey uh, where do you guys want this?",
        "(voice strained) Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?",
        "AH HAH! I DID IT! HA HA! Alright... (He takes a box out, about to close fridge, then thinks.) Better take all I can carry. Who knows when i'll be able to get in here again!",
        "Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?",
        "Alright!",
        "(abashed) A place to entertain my lady friends.",
        "(even more abashed) A place to eat spaghetti.",
        "Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don't sell tickets here in New York, so...",
        "(hesitates for a moment)Yeah Connecticut...Not West Virginia.",
        "Uh!",
        "Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?",
        "I like those odds!",
        "(who wasn't paying attention)What's that now?",
        "(sounding panicky)Oh my god Ross! You don't have Emma! And Rachel you don't have Emma! (Starts yelling) Where's Emma? Who has Emma!?",
        "(not yelling anymore)I was?",
        "I did?",
        "Oh yeah! The casserole lady.",
        "Ooh! Tough odds!",
        "(smiling)Look who's coming around!",
        "(excited)Did you get it?",
        "(Still excited)By you!?",
        "I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.",
        "I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you know...won't come true!",
        "Can't really say!",
        "(slightly irritated)I'm not really comfortable with these questions!",
        "I won, hey!",
        "Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it?",
        "Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks!",
        "Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward.",
        "You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe you're taking this away from me!",
        "Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?",
        "I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when did you even get those?",
        "(to Ross) I'll show you how.",
        "Yeah, I want my tickets too (takes the bowl from Rachel)! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!",
        "Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea! (takes the bowl from Monica)",
        "(in pain) Oh!",
        "No, no! (they all go towards the balcony but they get jammed in the window)",
        "(sitting on the sofa in front of the tv) Rach, come on! They are announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myself changing.",
        "And what did she say?",
        "(checking the last ticket) Damnit! anybody got anything?",
        "(to Chandler) Hey, that is so great about the job.",
        "And I like to think I had a little something to do with it.",
        "Well, before, with the wishbone... I didn't wish we would win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job.",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "Me too.",
        "(sitting in a chair) Hey guys, so I just called the Powerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won.",
        "Hey Ross, check this out! (he tries to spin a basketball on his fingertip but he throws it against a table) yeah, I can't do that!",
        "Hey! (he throws the basketball against a table again)",
        "(he stops Chandler from posting the message) No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!",
        "Dude! (he opens his arms to receive the ball from Ross' hands)",
        "(after Ross leaves the room) aaand SEND! (he hits the send button)",
        "Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!",
        "Chandler... hey... (he goes towards his room but he stops near Emma's cot) Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma? (he looks puzzled)",
        "(still very puzzled) Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!",
        "Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount...",
        "Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!",
        "Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. (he picks up Hugsy) It's okay, Emma, you stay asleep. (Emma cries)",
        "It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.",
        "Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.",
        "(placing Hugsy back in the crib) There you go sweetie... (to Emma) This isn't over.",
        "Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend.",
        "No, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new Hugsy!",
        "No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.",
        "Make the transfer! (She does so)",
        "Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.",
        "But he's the same.",
        "But he's the same.",
        "He's the same!",
        "(to the new Hugsy) You're not the same!",
        "Original or crappy?",
        "No, sorry haven't seen him.",
        "It's Monica, ok?",
        "Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him..",
        "... she's being unreasonable!",
        "It does?",
        "Really? She... she loves me?",
        "Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then... well she can have him.",
        "Look forget it forget it... I can't do it.",
        "How do you think I got him in the first place?",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious (which, being Joey, he mispronounces \"amonious\"). (pause) That's not how she used it...?",
        "Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. No? Am I getting close?",
        "(sipping red wine from a glass) Who says that wine has to cost more than milk!",
        "Heeey!",
        "Come on in, how are ya?",
        "Can I offer you a drink?",
        "Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to open a door and go (looking scared) ohhhh!",
        "Hey, if you need a tour guide... (point to himself)",
        "Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?",
        "(looking puzzled and nodding) Ok!",
        "I know, yeah!",
        "Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna see the Yankees.",
        "Which one, they all suck!",
        "(looking puzzled) I don't think so.",
        "Ross!",
        "I need to talk to you about Charlie.",
        "Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem.",
        "No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her body is soo...",
        "Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!",
        "(checking) EH, what do you know!",
        "Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!",
        "Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her.",
        "Thanks.",
        "The Metsss!",
        "(realizing) Oh, that's what she meant! (pause) You know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion!",
        "Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.",
        "Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!",
        "Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?",
        "You got to tell me exactly what to do there.",
        "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make the right (and he bends his arm to the left. Ross then bends Joey's arm to the right and Joey nods)",
        "(gesturing at an imaginary painting) Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.",
        "(shaking his head as if to say: of course not!) No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!",
        "Phonetically? (Looks confused)",
        "Ok.",
        "Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on \"Days\" I had to say \"Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy\".",
        "No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means \"you're gonna get eaten by a bear\".",
        "Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! (Reaches out to touch the imaginary painting).",
        "Come on! you... (reaches out to touch the imaginary painting again)",
        "Hey!",
        "(to Charlie) You're ready?",
        "(aside, to Ross) Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me up.",
        "Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be, but... (confidently) I made it work.",
        "(enters the room) Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?",
        "Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.",
        "It's a one-woman play called \"Why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life\".",
        "You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!",
        "I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.",
        "(lifts Rachel up and moves her behind him so she can walk on) Hey, here you go.",
        "(entering the room) Hey!",
        "What's happenin'?",
        "Oh, I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first",
        "(yelling) Stupid Jane Rogers!!",
        "Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people.",
        "I do it every year.",
        "I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!",
        "Yeah...",
        "Yeah...",
        "(Smiling) I can't believe you guys went for that one!",
        "You're fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!",
        "(speaking aloud) Please, I was trying to be nice, you're the worst one!",
        "Ok, ok! Fine! You can come, but don't tell anybody else. It's up on the roof at 8.",
        "(sounds tired) Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun.",
        "What party?",
        "(looks perplexed and opens up his robe) Ok... I mean...",
        "(to Charlie after covering himself up again) Nice to meet ya! (Charlie waves hesitantly and Joey leaves)",
        "(To some people) Hey! Hey alright! Hey, glad you could make it (Shakes a man's hand) Thanks for coming.",
        "Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...",
        "Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. (To Dirk) Dirk, this is my good friend Ross. (Ross and Dirk shake hands)",
        "It's a science.",
        "Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...",
        "Monica!",
        "(To Rachel) What have you got there?",
        "Ah, let me see! (she hands him a pile of tissues) Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?",
        "(browsing the tissues) Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug (discards one). This guy's Canadian (discards another). And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different.",
        "(discarding all the remaining tissues one by one) Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass...",
        "Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.",
        "That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight.",
        "Me.",
        "Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!",
        "Gotcha.",
        "So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.",
        "Oh hey Rach!",
        "Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.",
        "Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes.",
        "(to Charlie) Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... (aside to Rachel)... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!",
        "What's the matter, Pheebs?",
        "Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.",
        "Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?",
        "(to Charlie) Alright, have a good time. (they kiss)",
        "Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!",
        "Bye.",
        "All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?",
        "So you're ruling out surrogacy?",
        "So, I don't have to learn what that means?",
        "Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?",
        "Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!",
        "Hello?",
        "No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?",
        "Oh! How's it going?",
        "What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!",
        "Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!",
        "Well, just wake him up!",
        "Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... (pause) no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?",
        "(impressed) Wow! You look... (drops the cookie)... stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness!",
        "Then don't go!",
        "Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!",
        "Ooh... I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm kissing Rachel!",
        "Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then I saw him kissing Charlie...",
        "Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?",
        "No idea what it means.",
        "I don't believe this... Have you guys been...",
        "Is he gone?",
        "Pssst...",
        "Well, he's with Charlie now.",
        "(long pause and he twitches a bit) You're a pain in my ass, Geller!",
        "Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to Ross.",
        "Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off...",
        "(turns around very fast) I like although!",
        "Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...",
        "Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.",
        "I'm thinking about you...",
        "Let's forget about Ross...",
        "What's wrong?",
        "Well, maybe I can help. (he grabs her head passionately, closes his eyes and kisses... Ross in Rachel's dress! He realises it too late, and when he does, pushes Ross's/Rachel's head away)",
        "Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...",
        "Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.",
        "Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?",
        "I understand...",
        "I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.",
        "Ooh...",
        "I'm gonna get the lasagna.",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah?",
        "You kissed.",
        "I saw you.",
        "Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.",
        "It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy.",
        "Yeah... Now I have something...",
        "Oh... uh... look... before you...",
        "I am those things, yeah.",
        "Dude!",
        "I can't think of anything.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.",
        "Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.",
        "Hey!",
        "So, did you err... did you tell Ross?",
        "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory. (he pushes his breasts together from the side)",
        "Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.",
        "I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals.",
        "Yeah! Good night! (they give each other a small kiss on the mouth, and stare at each other for a while)",
        "Good night! (they give each other a kiss again, but this time it lasts longer)",
        "Stop saying good night.",
        "(entering) Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!",
        "Mmh-mmh.",
        "Barbados!",
        "All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.",
        "I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow! (A woman goes towards them)",
        "(to Charlie) I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time!",
        "That... never happens...",
        "No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called \"The Days of Our Lives\".",
        "(thinking he's kidding) Ok, Ross! It's... It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray.",
        "You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at??",
        "Yeah! How you doin'? Yeah alright!",
        "Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?",
        "You really should have been more clear about that!",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?",
        "You could say: \"Hey Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears?\" (looks at Ross matter-of-factly)",
        "Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?",
        "(smiling) Will you wear a thong?",
        "Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!",
        "Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming...",
        "No, why?",
        "Oh man!",
        "I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole! (removes a small plastic spade used by children to play on the beach from his backpack)",
        "Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!",
        "Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!",
        "Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in (Joey, Chandler and David leave)",
        "Hey guys!",
        "Damnit!",
        "Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? (Chandler looks annoyed at him and Joey leans in to him) Oh! Secret teapot?",
        "It's really gone?",
        "I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.",
        "Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can.",
        "Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a \"Galaxy far, far away\"? (Ross turns aroud and glares at him. Joey and Rachel decide to leave).",
        "I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.",
        "Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.",
        "(stopping the waiter) Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!",
        "Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?",
        "(walking to a table with many badges on it) I know we're not, but (he picks up a badge) Frank Medeio and... (picks up another badge) Eva Trorro... womba...",
        "Kate Miller it is. (he picks up the Kate Miller badge and sticks it on Rachel's breast)",
        "In that case should I make sure it's on real good? (he does so, repeatedly tapping on her breast and stroking it)",
        "Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.",
        "Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?",
        "But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?",
        "There it is, you're blushing!",
        "You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it? (tickles her a little)",
        "Tell me who it is.",
        "Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. You're not getting away that easy. Who do you like, who?",
        "What? Why not? Rach, who can you not get?",
        "(eagerly) Yeah, who is that?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?",
        "Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who...",
        "Yeah. (they leave)",
        "Night.",
        "He said \"erectus\"!",
        "No, he really said it.",
        "Erectus?",
        "Yeah, and so funny!",
        "Hey! (stands up) As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya! (smiles ecstatic)",
        "(disappointed) Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you...",
        "(interrupting her) Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech... (pulls a face)",
        "(bewildered) Oh! Oh, well! At least we're both having fun!",
        "Yeah! A little bit, yeah...",
        "Yeah... I think we do... (sighs, with folded arms)... about what?",
        "(downhearted) Hey...",
        "Uh... Charlie and I broke up.",
        "Oh well, she said we have nothing in common.",
        "No, it's not, we have nothing in common!",
        "I mean, she should be with someone like... Ross! You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too! Man, smart people are dull!",
        "(laughing sarcastically) Ok, Rach!",
        "I feel so stupid, you know? Why... why do I keep going after the wrong girls?",
        "Oh, c'mon, I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie, and it's like... (sighs) What the hell is my problem? OH! (He falls back on the bed)",
        "(sitting up again) I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me!",
        "But then who? The waitress I went out with last month? (gives her a meaningful look)",
        "(stands up) No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?",
        "Ok! All right, well... I'm gonna see if I can get a room for the night and I'll... I'll see you later!",
        "You like me? (shuts the door)",
        "(shocked) That's a huge thing!",
        "What... for how long?",
        "(outraged) A MONTH??",
        "(stands up) I just have one question!",
        "(desperate) What the hell are you doin'???",
        "Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as... as... George!!",
        "CURIOUS GEORGE! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!",
        "Yeah, he had a paper route.",
        "No, I know, yeah I know we're great but Rach no... this... this can't happen!",
        "(charmed, but then recoiling) NO, NO! It can't happen at all!",
        "Because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok? (in a trembling voice) I have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did I ever say no! (sighs) I couldn't do it to Ross!",
        "I know, I know! But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right... (painfully) I'm sorry...!",
        "NO! No-no-no-no-no-no! Hey! Hey, we'll be fine! Li... hey, like you said: no big deal!",
        "NO BIG DEAL!",
        "Yeah! I'll see ya later! Yeah!",
        "Yeah. It's actually our first official date",
        "Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at.",
        "(pause) It's OK!",
        "Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!",
        "No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have to appreciate their uniqueness.",
        "No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.",
        "NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this. (He starts lightly grazing Chandler's thigh)",
        "More foosball?",
        "I thought you paid. (Rachel does not answer and seems puzzled) Ha, guess we won’t be going back there!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of the couch?",
        "What’s the matter?",
        "I don’t get it, Chandler loved it!",
        "Ok.",
        "(a little giddy) Uh, was that good for you?",
        "Joey’s apartment. Joey and Rachel are sitting on the couch]\nJoey: Rach, you sure you wanna do this?",
        "Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?",
        "Ok, yeah, got it.",
        "Okay.",
        "This thing welded shut?!",
        "All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this thing.",
        "Sorry!",
        "I'm sorry! (He stands up) This never happened to me before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open! I blame your bra!",
        "Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me off with all your slapping!",
        "(contemplates for a few moments what Rachel just said) NAH! I don't have another level!!",
        "Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second (points to the hall).",
        "(To Rachel) Hey!",
        "Yes ma'am, ready to Power through!",
        "Uh! (When she's done she throws her bra at him)",
        "Ok, you're scaring me a little bit.",
        "Oh! yeah!",
        "uh uh!",
        "No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!",
        "(He just sits there, legs very close together with a painful look on his face) Soldier down!",
        "Well, I know what's the matter with me.",
        "I don't know.",
        "Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?",
        "Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit.",
        "Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it.",
        "That's a... pla-an.",
        "(sighs) Wow... I did not see this coming.",
        "I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what I wanted.",
        "I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.",
        "So...",
        "I love ya.",
        "Yeah, me too.",
        "Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.",
        "Hey!",
        "18, uh? (starts to prepare himself to say his \"How You Doin'\" line)",
        "What, what!? it's for her hot friends!",
        "And starting to think about settling down!",
        "I'd love to! Yeah! ",
        "(To Phoebe) We were supposed to bring presents?",
        "Oh, yeah! How was I supposed to know?",
        "Yeah, but for a one-year-old. What's the point... the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says \"El-moo\"! (Joey starts laughing) Yeah... that's a funny cup!",
        "Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.",
        "Oh man, this is great, uh? The three of us together again! You know what would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!",
        "Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song, maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!",
        "No, no, no! My talents as an actor!",
        "You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books!",
        "Hey, I think Emma might like it!",
        "Um, my present!",
        "Actually we prepared performances.",
        "But equally real!",
        "(unconfidently) O K.",
        "Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting!",
        "I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma’s books.",
        "Uh, why, it’s a... (he picks a book up) one of her favorites, uh, (he reads the title of the book) “Riding the Storm Out. Coping with post-partum depression” eesh! (he puts the book back and picks up another) “Love you forever”. Love you forever. By Robert Munsch. Published by Firefly books. Printed (he pauses and changes the tone to a dramatic one) in Mexico. A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang “I’ll love you forever, I’ll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you’ll be”. (the picture fades and Joey is now finishing the book). And while he rocked her, he sang “I’ll love you forever, I’ll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you’ll be”.",
        "I'm so confused!",
        "Got it! (Goes towards the front door and stands with his back to it) Hey hey hey! (to Chandler) Where do you think you're going?",
        "Alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we're gonna be here for a li...(stops and thinks) Wait a minute, there is a window in there!",
        "Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it.",
        "No.",
        "Ok! (Opens the door for them)",
        "Nighty-night!",
        "Bye, bye.",
        "Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm not gonna mess with Jack, he's a great man, he fought for our country.",
        "(Shocked) Oh! Well that's it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you guys in. (turns the bolts of the door, thereby locking it)",
        "Oh! I forgot you used to live here!",
        "Hello?",
        "Hey! (smiles)",
        "(smile fades) What audition?",
        "What? You never said anything about an audition!",
        "A monologue? I don't have.. (sees the book he was reading before for his \"dramatic reading\") I got it. (hangs up) (announces to the room) Aah! so... I'm gonna take off!",
        "Oh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever gets the highest number gets to go first.",
        "Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?",
        "Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..",
        "Right.",
        "Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys! (they do so)",
        "Come on robot!",
        "Way to go robot!",
        "Hey, good race you guys.",
        "Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE TIME!",
        "(to Ross and Rachel) I've been here the whole time!",
        "What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it was a pen1s.\nENDING CREDITS\n[Scene: Rachel and Joey's apartment. It's just Ross and Rachel. They put the camera on a tripod in the kitchen and they are standing in front of the camera.]",
        "Hey!",
        "Well, hey! Well... (he takes his mug to toast Phoebe) Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and... (a bit uncertain) I wanna say Mike? (pause) To Phoebe and Mike!",
        "(Looking inside the fridge, and we only see his back. Then he closes the door, and we see it's Joey.) Hi sweetie!",
        "No.",
        "Cool!",
        "That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?",
        "What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon! Huh? (he mimes an old man with a beard) I'm old! (then he yawns) I'm tired! (then he mimes someone who's hot...) Hey, I'm hot (...and cold) I'm cold!! Huh?? Come on! What can't I do?",
        "I can do that! (in a deeper voice) \"Hello, I'm your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. I like to use...\" Oh, what's the product?",
        "(after a long pause he starts miming again) I'm cold!",
        "Oh! Any word on casting yet?",
        "What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?",
        "Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't pass it on to your bosses!",
        "Thank you. (he sits down)",
        "Damn it! (he leaves)",
        "Just pass it to your boss!",
        "What's up?",
        "(sounds disappointed) Oh.",
        "(looks at him suspiciously) But, ehm... you watched the tape?",
        "(sounds confident) You didn't watch the tape.",
        "Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?",
        "Well, you lied again! (Rachel comes out of her room and is observing the conversation)",
        "Keep going Pinocchio!",
        "(yelling back) No you didn't! (turns and goes towards his room)",
        "You still here?",
        "Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok? First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying... (loses count and begins to count the number of 'lyings' in the air but gives up.) (yelling) Stop lying!",
        "(very angry) You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why? (goes back into his room)",
        "(comes out holding the tape) Here's how I know you didn't watch the tape, ok? (puts it into the vcr) If you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan. (presses play and he appears on the TV screen and a TV commercial begins)",
        "(Yelling at Chandler) And that's how I know you didn't watch the tape! (goes back to his room and slams the door).",
        "(enters from his bedroom) What?",
        "I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.",
        "But it's an original Buffay...",
        "Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?",
        "GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!",
        "That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied.",
        "Now, what do you say?",
        "And?... AND?",
        "Gladys?",
        "You're mean!",
        "Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!",
        "No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from a can!",
        "U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight.",
        "Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!",
        "I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one.",
        "Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start... \"Dear baby adoption decider people...\"",
        "Hey!",
        "Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?",
        "That's right, yeah.",
        "Always nice to meet a fan!",
        "I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.",
        "(using a laptop) Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so...",
        "What did I just say?",
        "Oh my God, that's great! I'm smart!! No, no, I'm... (he uses the Thesaurus) \"brainy, bright, clever\", I love this thing! Look out ladies, Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!!",
        "Hey, finished my recommendation. (he hands it over to Chandler) Here. And I think you’ll be very, very happy. It’s the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at p0rn.",
        "(sounding very proud of himself) Some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya?",
        "Of course it does! It’s smart! I used the the-saurus!",
        "Yep!",
        "Oh, ‘They are warm, nice, people with big hearts’.",
        "Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude.",
        "Why not?",
        "Ah, look who’s back! (he sees the bags) Why do you have bags? RACH, WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?",
        "What?",
        "You slept out here?",
        "But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me we’re getting rid of her.",
        "Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said (aping Amy badly) \"Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!\" I don’t need that kind of talk in my house!",
        "'Cause we will appreciate it more when she’s gone?",
        "Yeah, Monica made us!",
        "Yeaah.",
        "(yelling at her) I’M CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!",
        "Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.",
        "Yeah.",
        "No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to hand-write it. (Chandler and Monica look even more shocked)",
        "Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all! See ya later! (Leaves)",
        "(picks up the phone) Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani... Oh, hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home right now... (looks puzzled) Okay, bye bye. (hangs up) (to himself) She was nice!",
        "Whoo-hoo! (and leaves for Rachel's room)",
        "(Yelling from Rachel's room) She has a lot of crap!",
        "Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?",
        "Rach, he just saw us.",
        "But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.",
        "Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but..",
        "Yeah, but it did happen, so...",
        "Ross?",
        "No, no, no!",
        "Probably.",
        "No, no!",
        "Really?",
        "Ross..",
        "Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?",
        "I do like fajitas.",
        "Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.",
        "I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...",
        "In a carriage!",
        "Hey, Charlie!",
        "So, did you bring a little something for Ross?",
        "Oh. Oh, thanks.",
        "Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..",
        "Uh, actually, that's..",
        "Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.",
        "Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?",
        "Dude, are you okay?",
        "You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.",
        "Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.",
        "It doesn't look good, does it?",
        "Morning. Here you go.",
        "Yeah.",
        "No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.",
        "Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..",
        "It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.",
        "That's what I hear, yeah.",
        "Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...",
        "I'm crazy about her.",
        "I think so.",
        "Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.",
        "No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?",
        "And we're okay?",
        "I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!",
        "But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?",
        "I'm gonna say someone I'm gonna have s*x with. (the girl leaves and Phoebe goes toward the couch) (to Phoebe) Hey!",
        "So... who's your friend?",
        "OW, why, why, why?",
        "Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with.",
        "Mandy, uh? Uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?",
        "I know why I don't remember her, huh? (he winks at Rachel)",
        "Ok, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, Rach?",
        "(pointing at himself) Growth!",
        "Ok, thank you. And I promise you I will not forget this one. (he starts writing on his hand) Mandy.",
        "Saraaah.",
        "I can see why, nice shirt!",
        "Stupid Gap on every corner!\n[Scene: The Adoption Agency in Ohio. Monica and Chandler are entering with a man.]",
        "Hey.",
        "Well...",
        "Nope.",
        "Oh, really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner, ok? (he starts talking about the date and we can see what happened through a flashback video) We're getting along, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, out of nowhere...",
        "Hey, hey, look! It’s not about a few fries... it’s about what the fries represent.",
        "ALL FOOD!",
        "Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don’t order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That’s a good way to lose some fingers!",
        "(mad and pointing a finger to himself) JOEY DOESN’T SHARE FOOD!",
        "(he thinks a little, considering the option and seems to be quite satisfied) I like that! A sharing buffer! Yeah! I’ll order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza, uh? And some mozzarella sticks. (he looks absorbed in his food thoughts) What were we talking about?",
        "I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!",
        "(now laughing a little) Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.",
        "(looking a little agitated now) Looks like someone IS the ladies!!",
        "Oh, that looks great! Good ordering!",
        "oh, I didn't know you liked French fries. Help yourself! What's mine is yours. (Sarah reaches over and takes a few fries)",
        "Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.",
        "How about those fries though, huh? (Holds the plate between Sarah’s fingers and his plate, thus blocking her from reaching his)",
        "(Spotting her movements takes her hand into his own) You are beautiful, you know that?",
        "Oh (grinning, trying to hold in his impatience with her) okay.. (she takes her hand back)",
        "(Visibly annoyed) NOW look what you did!!",
        "I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?",
        "WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT!",
        "I'm sorry, I'm overreacting. Okay, It's just when it comes to food, I have certain rules, okay, I mean (bends down and with his plate and his hands, scrapes the dropped dinner back onto the plate and puts it back on the table) There are things you do..and you now, things.. (takes something from the plate and blows it a little) that you don't do (He takes a bite from it).",
        "I really am sorry about, you know..before. I just want to make sure you know that I really do like you.",
        "(Jokingly) Well, stuffed clams.",
        "Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.",
        "(More to himself than anyone else) So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to\nbe healthy. (pushes it aside)",
        "Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead.",
        "Oh yeah, sure. No problem.",
        "Sure I do. (holding up his own dessert) Coule?",
        "(laughing) Really?",
        "Yeah, of course. I can control myself. (laughs uneasily and Sarah leaves the room)",
        "(to the torte) Stop staring at me!",
        "Why, just a tiny little...",
        "Oh-oh!",
        "I'm not even sorry.",
        "(nods) So, why are you still wearing it?",
        "Ooh... Not so good.",
        "Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse.",
        "(shouting to Ross) JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!",
        "Hey!",
        "What's going on?",
        "Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?",
        "Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity.",
        "(pointing at himself) Celebrity.",
        "(going out with the VCR in his hand) Well, I guess we'll never know whose it is!",
        "(form the other side of the door) Hellooo? Anybody in there order a celebrity?\n(He starts to enter the apartment and Chandler runs to the door and shuts it back in\nhis face) OW!",

        "Guys!?",
        "What's going on?",
        "Everything doesn't sound fine!",
        "Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble.",
        "But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger!",
        "We don't? We really should. From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word for danger.",
        "(quivering with anger) I did not care for that!",
        "Ok, ok! (He leaves)",
        "I forgot my bat.",
        "(to Chandler) Bert! Bert! Bert! Bert!",
        "Uhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got some nerve, coming back here. I can't believe you never called me.",
        "Oh... yeah... Probably you don't even remember my name. It's Joey, by the way. And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it... lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me.",
        "No, no! Don't try to turn this around on me, ok? I'm not some kind of... social work, ok, that you can just... do.",
        "Really? Think about it. Come on! You're a beautiful woman, smart, funny, we had a really good time, huh? If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you?",
        "No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok? You broke my heart. You know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you? (and he leaves the apartment, leaving her shocked)",
        "(acting sad) NO! I waited a long time, I can't wait anymore... (and closes the door behind him)",
        "LAURA! (and points to her, very confident)",
        "Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!",
        "Three tickets to today's Rangers game!!",
        "Oh.",
        "Yeah, they're great seats too!",
        "Center ice.",
        "So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time.",
        "Dude, two times that happened!",
        "Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four.",
        "That's some gentle comedy, dude. (he and Ross leave)",
        "Yeah!",
        "Oh, Bob, get off the guy!",
        "I know, yeah.",
        "Yeah. I am sorry he's not here too, but I got to say, (takes some nachos from a plate on the seat where Chandler should have been) I am really enjoying Nacho Chair.",
        "Ohhhh! These seats are great!",
        "(looks at the time) Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner.",
        "I don't know...",
        "Okay.",
        "How late are we?",
        "Wow (He opens his apartment door and throws their stuff in.)",
        "Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were! (he raises his hands and on his right one there's a Rangers foam finger)",
        "Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!",
        "You are not at Thanksgiving?",
        "We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time (he points the foam finger at the girls)",
        "Yeah, where were you!",
        "Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...",
        "(realizing) Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!",
        "All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae.",
        "No. Here (he tears off the pocket from Ross' shirt, and tears off everything below that as well.)",
        "(whispering) Who do you think its from?",
        "I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning.",
        "(smiling from ear to ear) Ah-haah! I win!!",
        "That's fire. Beats everything.",
        "Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played.",
        "I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that. (Ross picks it up)",
        "(holds his fist up) WATER BALLOON! (he stuffs the slice in is mouth and gives the foil back to Ross)",
        "(to Ross) Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us.",
        "I'm telling ya... (his eyes open wide and he looks like his eyes are about to pop out. He stares at Ross like this without blinking) I can do it.",
        "Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing...",
        "(still with his door wedged in the door gap, now opens his eyes wide and stares at Monica and Chandler as he did with Ross earlier in the hall) Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.",
        "Come on you guys, we want you to know we're (His eye widen even more) very very sorry. (Monica and Chandler are now covering their eyes with their hands) (then to the others in the hall) Right guys?",
        "(smiling) Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?",
        "Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!",
        "(to Ross, mouthing) Don't make me come up there!",
        "Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.",
        "Sorry!",
        "Yeah! You three have a nice Thanksgiving.",
        "Yeah! You, Chan, and the vein!",
        "Ha!",
        "Oh-oh! I'm stuck!",
        "No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.",
        "(in agony) aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head.",
        "Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something.",
        "I just wanna say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person...",
        "Oh, that smells good!",
        "Okay.",
        "It isn't working.",
        "Well hurry, I can't feel my ears!",
        "Interesting...",
        "I left them at the park.",
        "It's really starting to hurt.",
        "Ooh! Stop putting things down my pants!",
        "Yeah! Come on!",
        "(looking at himself) Man, I've got food all over me.",
        "Oh, I know how you feel...",
        "Sure. I went through the exact same thing with Alicia Mae Emory... The waiting, the wandering... Then one day... I get that call from Toys \"R\" Us... She was in stock!",
        "Uhm... oh... I don't know, it's too hard.",
        "Oh... food. No, s*x. Food! s*x! Food! Se-I don't know! Good God, I don't know, I want girls on bread!",
        "Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can’t believe he would do this to Monica!",
        "Hey, is uhm... is Chandler here?",
        "(walking towards her to hold her and support her) Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?",
        "(to Chandler) You son of a bitch!",
        "I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!",
        "(clearly shocked) What?",
        "Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!",
        "No, no, it's not, don't listen to him! (to Ross) I'm gonna thump you! (points his fist at him)",
        "Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food? (Walks towards the fridge) Because I can stop doing that, (looks at the fridge) I really, really think I can!",
        "What the hell are you doin'?",
        "(he has a turkey on his head) It's stuck!!!",
        "I put it on to scare Chandler!",
        "It smells really bad in here.",
        "It's Joey.",
        "(shocked) Dah!! (Chandler motions for him to calm down.)",
        "Oooooh!",
        "Big fat goalie.",
        "Weekend at Bernie’s.",
        "Everyday use.",
        "Guest.",
        "Uhh, 11!",
        "Hey, don’t get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!",
        "(panicking) Dude! He's right there!",
        "Rachel's right. This is where you guys belong.",
        "I'm really sorry you guys.",
        "You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before.",
        "And about this Nancy thing... If you're not sleeping with her, should I?",
        "A meatball Sub? Thanks! (he got a meatball sandwich)",
        "(speaking with his mouth full, enjoying his sandwich) What did they say?",
        "Hey guys!",
        "Sure.",
        "Would you guys want to come down tomorrow and watch me tape the show?",
        "Seriously?",
        "(to Gene) I know it could be intimidating for regular people to be around celebrities but... relax, I'm just like you! (pause) Only better looking and richer.",
        "(on the screen there's the word \"Supermarket\") Uhm... ok. It's a store, like a supermarket. (there is a sound indicating he made a mistake as he shouldn't have said 'supermarket'. The next word appears, \"notebook\") Oh! I see-I see what I did. Yeah, ok, ok, uhm... I'm writing in my...",
        "Noo, (whispering) more like a notebook... Damn it! (next word appears: \"blueprint\") Oh, if I'm building an house, the plan isn't called the 'shmoo-print'... Can't say that either?

        "Oh.",
        "Yeah...",
        "Oh, so we didn't win, but it's fun to play the game, right?",
        "Oh, wow! I'm so sorry, ok? I promise, we'll do better next time!",
        "Hey, you know, some of those are pretty hard! Like why would there be a ghost in my fridge? (pause). Yeah!",
        "(To Henrietta) My friend Rachel has a kid. I totally know nursery rhymes! (makes a thumbs up sign)",
        "Oh, .. uh... uh... pass. (Next word: \"Rotunda\") Pass. (Next word: \"Filibuster\" stares at it a moment) Pass. (Henrietta is looking very confused) (Next word: \"Addendum\" 4 seconds remaining) Okay, the little thing that hangs down at the back of your throat.",
        "Oh, then pass. (Next word: \"Joint session\", but time's up, Joey acts very disappointed)",
        "(nervously) Yeah...",
        "I-I-I don't know. Types of trees?",

        "Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this.",
        "Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?",
        "Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?",
        "You know, on the one hand you're happy for them, but on the other hand it's hard to let go.",
        "Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!",
        "So, you know I'm filling in for Phoebe's step dad, tomorrow, right?",
        "Oh, hey, my pleasure. (he suddenly becomes very serious) So what are your intentions with my Phoebe?",
        "Oh, a wiseacre. (Mike looks bewildered). No, no, no, I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? Isn't that kind of unstable?",
        "Strike two!",
        "Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!",
        "Oh, man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages!",
        "(to Mike) Hello Michael.",
        "May I have a word with you, please?",
        "Have a seat. (Mike sits on his bed, and Joey towers over him. He starts talking in an Italian godfather-type voice) Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me... (shakes his head) I cannot allow this.",
        "More back talk. And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for \"Family Honor 2: Thissa Time Itsa Personal.\"",
        "I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her.",
        "(very satisfied and smiling) That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family.",
        "(almost crying) That was ME!",
        "I'm glad we had this little talk.",
        "(staring at the ice sculpture) How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that? (They all glare at him)",
        "Hey, what are you guys gonna do?",
        "The blizzard. I just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels. (Opens the curtains to reveal a snow storm outside)",
        "I don't think they are.",
        "Yeah according to the news, most of the city did.",
        "Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl.",
        "Oh hey, don't worry. I'm still ordained from your wedding.",
        "Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh...",
        "I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do.",
        "Friends, family, dog... Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event. The cold has now spread to my special place... so I'm gonna do the short version of this. Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other. And I know I speak for every one here... when I wish them a lifetime of happiness. Who has the rings?",
        "(whispering to Phoebe) Okay...",
        "Yeah?",
        "Oh, okay. Phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?",
        "Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?",
        "I now pronounce you... husband and wife.",
        "It was, yeah. I kind of don't want it to end. Hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?",
        "Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?",
        "Well anyway, I'm glad you're back, I really need your help.",

        "You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody.",
        "Can I uh see something? (Takes Ben. When he puts him close to Monica, Ben cries. When he moves Ben away, he stops crying.)",
        "Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat.",
        "We'll watch him.",
        "I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.",
        "You understood that?",
        "Is he the one with the beautiful wife?",
        "You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?",
        "No, I got him.",
        "Oh, seriously you want him?",
        "Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?",
        "Well, we are great guys.",
        "That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!",
        "(to taxi driver) Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.",
        "Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.",
        "You done?",
        "You know it?",
        "Oh, sure, they love us over there.",
        "Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.",
        "(on pay phone) Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.",
        "That's me.",
        "Actually, uh, we're both the father. (Puts his arm around Joey)",
        "Please tell me you know which one is our baby.",
        "Ok.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.",
        "What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?",
        "Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?",
        "All right, call it in the air.",
        "Heads it is.",
        "We have to assign heads to something.",
        "What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?",
        "(looking fearfully at Joey) Hey, he's not crying.",
        "You, you are gonna love this. ",
        "Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!",
        "I didn't know it was a big secret.",
        "You bitch.",
        "C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.",
        "Joey was in a porno movie.",
        "If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.",
        "Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.",
        "Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?",
        "No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.",
        "Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . . ",
        "Uh, Julie.",
        "Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright.",
        "What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.",
        "OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.",
        "Nice work my friend.",
        "Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.",
        "I got the time to get to know Julie.",
        "I'm goin' home.",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.",
        "And twenty-five it is.",
        "Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?",
        "Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.",
        "What's in the bag?",
        "Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.",
        "Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.",
        "Who said anything about Christmas?",
        "So whaddya got there Monica?",
        "Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?",
        "Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.",
        "Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time.",
        "Hey.",
        "Eeeshk.",
        "OK.",
        "OK. [reads paper] Brake left, gas right?",
        "[grabs for seat belt] Where's my seat belt?",
        "[Chandler gets in the back seat] Hey!",
        "Oh, so that's what this is for.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Alright.",
        "Alright, we're gettin' closer.",
        "Well, so why not go knock?",
        "Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.",
        "Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.",
        "Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!",
        "Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone. [Ross and Phoebe hug, Monica and Rachel hug, Chandler is left standing]",
        "OK, Phoebs, your turn.",
        "And, a lemon lime.",
        "And last but not least.",
        "Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there. (phone rings)",
        "No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.",
        "What?",
        "Bob here.",
        "(on phone) What've you been up to?",
        "Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. (to Ross) I love her.",
        "I'm back.",
        "Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?",
        "Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.",
        "I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.",
        "Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.",
        "Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.",
        "Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.",
        "Look guys, I know it's a little steep.",
        "But it's Ross.",
        "I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing.",
        "You know, I think I might just.",
        "Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.",
        "We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.",
        "All right.",
        "Hi.",
        "Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.",
        "Whoever stood you up is a jerk.",
        "I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?",
        "No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.",
        "Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. (to Ross) I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?",
        "Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.",
        "I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.",
        "Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?",
        "Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.",
        "You can tell us.",
        "We can talk about that.",
        "So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?",
        "No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.",
        "Together.",
        "So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?",
        "Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?",
        "By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.",
        "Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!",
        "If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.",
        "Why did you look at me when you said that?",
        "Fine.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had s*x today.",
        "Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.",
        "Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.",
        "I had s*x today. I never have to answer that phone again.",
        "Bob here.",
        "So, uh, you met someone, huh?",
        "So, uh, how was he?",
        "Eh?",
        "Well, that makes me feel so good.",
        "Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.",
        "So, let's go.",
        "Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.",
        "I can't believe the guys missed this.",
        "Chandler.",
        "Yeah, we really missed you guys.",
        "Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.",
        "I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.",
        "I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.",
        "Yes.",
        "No.",
        "Hey. Hold on a second. [shoots a goal] Huh?",
        "What's this?",
        "Well, I don't know what Big Leon told ya but it's an even thousand if you want me for the whole night. What is this for?",
        "Well, thanks man. Now I can get my pony.",
        "Wow, I don't know what to say. [opens the box and pulls out an incredibly gaudy gold bracelet] Wow, I, I don't know what to say.",
        "I don't know. It's a bracelet.",
        "[reads] To my best bud. [puts it back in the case] Thanks best bud.",
        "Oh, now? [puts it in his desk drawer] No, no, I think something this nice should be saved for a special occasion. [sets a chair in front of the drawer]",
        "I so am.",
        "Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track.",
        "Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight.",
        "Oh, she's goin' somewhere.",
        "Hey, you feelin' better?",
        "Ya know, the man's got a point. [gestures with his arm and the bracelet falls off]",
        "That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy.",
        "No, I'm alright, thanks.",
        "[walks over to the woman] I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.",
        "Chandler. [waves his arm around, exposing the bracelet]",
        "What? [realizes it was the bracelet] Oh this is excellent. You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap.",
        "Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. [Joey walks in behind Chandler]",
        "I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . [turns around and sees Joey] Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. [Joey turns around and walks out without saying anything] That's actually good.",
        "Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? [Joey doesn't respond] Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? [Throws a basketball to Joey. Joey doesn't move to catch it and the ball takes out a lamp] OK, that's my bad.",
        "Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?",
        "OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. [Joey goes to his room and shuts the door] Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . [notices the bracelet is missing from his wrist] wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there. [he starts searching the room, lifting up the couch cushions]",
        "I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . . [Joey returns to his room]",
        "I can't believe it.",
        "Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay. [sits down at the bar]",
        "What am I gonna do, huh? [Joey walks in behind him]",
        "Hey.",
        "Well this one's for you.",
        "No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, [puts bracelet on Joey] it's about you and me and the fact that we're [reading bracelet] best buds.",
        "That's what they'll call us.",
        "Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained.",
        "OK, I was wrong, that's what they used to cover Connecticut.",
        "Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?",
        "Work on your music?",
        "Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes.",
        "Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.",
        "Congratulations!",
        "Now we can finally watch Green Acres the way it was meant to be seen.",
        "So uh, which one is mine?",
        "[sits down] Ohh yes.",
        "[reaches for the footrest lever] Do we dare?",
        "Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild.",
        "Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both. But listen, don't ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, Geller-Green, they'll let you in, OK. If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you. OK, thanks. Pizza's on the way. I told you we wouldn't have to get up.",
        "I'll cancel the sodas.",
        "You got a Cheeto on your face man.[Joey removes the Cheeto and eats it]",
        "So how'd it go?",
        "Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.",
        "It's the Miracle Wax.",
        "Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice.",
        "Could you get us a couple of beers?",
        "She's one of us now.",
        "Well maybe he was nervous.",
        "Yeah. [feels the floor] Oh it's not warm yet, we still have time.",
        "Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.",
        "So, whaddya say boys, should I call him? [squeezes the ear of one of the slippers and it barks] Well, ya know what they say. Ask your slippers a question... you're going crazy.",
        "Hey.",
        "Listen, I'm, I'm sorry I didn't make it over there today.",
        "Yeah well, I hear the place looks great.",
        "Oh hey, it's, it's terriffic. I mean it's a regular space... fest.",
        "Yeah I just... wanted to call and say hey.",
        "That's right my friend. It's time for...",
        "I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.",
        "Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?",
        "See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind.",
        "But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together.",
        "But...",
        "So uhh, how's the palace?",
        "Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news.",
        "Well, uh, why don't you ask him yourself. Joey, this is my new roommate Eddie.",
        "Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room.",
        "Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare.",
        "Hey Jo. When'd you start usin' mousse in your hair?",
        "Morning.",
        "Oh it's uh, over there on the table.",
        "No, Eddie likes to keep it over there.",
        "Oh, ooh.",
        "What?",
        "Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good.",
        "See ya. [Eddie leaves]",
        "Oh, I couldn't be happier.",
        "There's another carton right over there.",
        "Alright, so what's it about?",
        "Well I like both eggs equally.",
        "Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?",
        "Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?",
        "[stares in disbeliefe] Yeah o-, OK, alright. [oven timer goes off] Doesn't matter, time for Baywatch.",
        "You don't like that show?",
        "Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.",
        "Oh o-, OK man.",
        "[reluctantly sings] You're obviously not their favorite pet.",
        "That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.",
        "Waaa-aaah.",
        "The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.",
        "Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. [Joey gets a sheepish look] You used my toothbrush?",
        "Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.",
        "Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.",
        "Hey.",
        "Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?",
        "Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?",
        "Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?",
        "I know, this is a great apartment.",
        "Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.",
        "[being left behind] Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK.",
        "Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.",
        "Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.",
        "What?",
        "Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.",
        "Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.",
        "Well then maybe you should take it.",
        "Fine with me.",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah me too.",
        "Yeah. So do we need to hug here or. . .",
        "So I got ya something. [tosses Joey a bag of plastic spoons]",
        "Lick away my man.",
        "What?",
        "No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?",
        "Well I didn't think that was serious. [grabs the spoons back] Ya know I thought that was just a fight.",
        "Well, there you go.",
        "Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.",
        "I did pay for half of it.",
        "Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.",
        "Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.",
        "Stop talkin' to your men. [Joey scores]",
        "Congratulations. [Chandler leaves]",
        "Oh yeah, you got the big TV. We'll be over there all the time. . . [Chandler gives him a look] except when we are here.",
        "[quietly] Yeah, I remember.",
        "So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?",
        "Thanks.",
        "Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so.",
        "Well, I'm guessing uh, tonight at the coffee house.",
        "Yeah.",
        "God that is good TV.",
        "Phoebs, play with meeee.",
        "Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.",
        "Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.",
        "No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.",
        "We don't need to remedy that.",
        "That was so lame.",
        "So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?",
        "What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.",
        "Well it's not Sean Penn.",
        "Hi.",
        "Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler, can I take a message, or, or a fishtank?",
        "Oh, oh, c'mon in.",
        "Oh.",
        "Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my very soul.",
        "Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little...",
        "Bit country? C'mon in here you roomie.",
        "Bye.",
        "So, we gettin' a fish?",
        "Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.",
        "This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.",
        "Buddy?",
        "There was no fish when she dropped it off.",
        "Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie...[puts his hand on Eddie's shoulder] Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon? [picks up the fruit an tosses it to Eddie, it hits Eddie in the chest and falls]",
        "So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.",
        "Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.",
        "Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.",
        "Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.",
        "We're worried about you.",
        "We came over as soon as we saw.",
        "It's gonna be ok. You know that?",
        "I'm sorry man.",
        "Uhhhaahh.",
        "Yeah alright. What're these, raisins?",
        "[throws it across the room while Eddie's not looking] Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?",
        "[looks in the fish bowl to see a fish cracker] Well that's not an, even a real fish. No, that's a goldfish cracker.",
        "Ok, good night. [walks towards his room] You big freak of nature.",
        "Man, I am so beat.",
        "Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?",
        "Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?",
        "No actually, I was just going for colorful.",
        "What just happened?",
        "That, that is funny. Can I have it back?",
        "No?",
        "Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?",
        "No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.",
        "[both enter looking down] Hhhiiii.",
        "The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat.",
        "Ohhh [turns as if to hug someone] Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one.",
        "Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.",
        "Hey.",
        "Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?",
        "Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.",
        "Don't play with his things.",
        "You had to ask.",
        "I think you played the Gunther card too soon.",
        "Your cappucino sir.",
        "Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.",
        "CHANDLER:Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.",
        "Ok.",
        "No?",
        "Alright, hang on a second there Custer.",
        "Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back.",
        "Would you come on! Come on! [waitress brings their coffee] Thank you.",
        "Ah, there we go.",
        "You burn your mouth?",
        "Bullies, big bullies.",
        "Yes, we're standing out ground...apparently.",
        "Alright, let's do this.",
        "Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?",
        "Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it.",
        "Ok. [reaches in his pocket]",
        "Ok.",
        "Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the middle?",
        "Hey, hey, those guys are takin our stuff! [some guy runs off with the hat]",
        "Yeah, I wouldn't know having missed everything.",
        "Ok so, can I have my hat back?",
        "Huh. [reaches over and grabs the hat and bolts for the door but slips and falls behind the couch]",
        "Hi Monica.",
        "Guys guys, check this out.",
        "Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster...",
        "No.",
        "Ok, you can have it. [He licks it and offers it to her.]",
        "That was there when I got here. [Takes a bite of his muffin.]",
        "Had it.",
        "Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.",
        "It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.",
        "Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.",
        "I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.",
        "Hey, how's the first day goin'?",
        "Well there you go.",
        "Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?",
        "Weird world. Your kids?",
        "Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.",
        "Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.",
        "Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.",
        "Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.",
        "Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.",
        "It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.",
        "Uh, if you say so sir.",
        "Well, I'm going to kill you.",
        "Why?",
        "Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?",
        "Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?",
        "Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.",
        "I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.",
        "Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.",
        "Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.",
        "Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.",
        "No freakshow, she's fictional.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.",
        "Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.",
        "Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.",
        "Why her mom?",
        "Excuse me?",
        "This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?",
        "So, basically just a Chinese guy.",
        "Yes because uh, you look so young.",
        "NO! No, I'll take that for ya.",
        "Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?",
        "Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?",
        "Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.",
        "Alright you guys are off to party number one [ushers 3 guys into Monica's apartment] and you, you are off to party number two [ushers four women into his apartment. Two guys try to follow and Chandler blocks them and shoos them off to Monica's apartment] Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.",
        "Ok, they're coming, shhh. [Runs into Monica's apartment and grabs one last girl to take to his apartment]",
        "Well, we could count again.",
        "Look, are you gonna be ok?",
        "Well, actually just one birthday flan.",
        "It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.",
        "Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.",
        "Volleyball.",
        "Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.",
        "Ok, that's me. [runs back]",
        "[running out of his apartment after a girl] Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. [sits down beside Rachel] Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.",
        "Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.",
        "Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?",
        "I, I know. [Hugs her. Ross walks out and Chandler puts her in his arms.]",
        "Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?",
        "Sorry, we're on a major flan high.",
        "Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.",
        "Well, how do you find clothes that fit?",
        "Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. [starts poking Monica in the shoulder] 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'",
        "Ok, that's Eric.",
        "I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old [Monica gives him a glare] -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.",
        "Ok, this could be tough.",
        "Ooh, you almost had it.",
        "Hey.",
        "Your boyfriend is so cool.",
        "Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.",
        "You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car [passes the dollar back].",
        "I think they get it.",
        "There's the man.",
        "Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.",
        "Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.",
        "Yeah, didn't he tell ya?",
        "You hear that? We're the guys.",
        "[runs in] Hey, big guy, game time.",
        "Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.",
        "Kick save and... denied.",
        "Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.",
        "See, that's why we don't let her play.",
        "Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time.",
        "No.",
        "Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.",
        "No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work.",
        "You're not a dad. You're not a dad.",
        "I can't believe you got us into trouble. [slaps Joey on the arm. Joey takes exception and slaps him back]",
        "Hey Eddie. Daahh!! What're you doin' here?",
        "Why?",
        "I can't sleep now.",
        "No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now.",
        "Hannibal Lecter...better roommate than you.",
        "I didn't realize that.",
        "GET OUT NOW!!",
        "Yes please.",
        "I want you out.",
        "Where did you hear it from before?",
        "Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here?",
        "Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?",
        "Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?",
        "Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...",
        "Your last roommate's kidney?",
        "Daaahhhh!",
        "Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching.",
        "Uuuh.",
        "Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.",
        "You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT!",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue.",
        "You want some help.",
        "[enters] Ding dong, the psycho's gone.",
        "Yes, yes I actually saw him leave. I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD!",
        "Our next cocktail party?",
        "Eddie, do you remember yesterday?",
        "Do you remember talking to me yesterday?",
        "So what happened?",
        "Oh sweet Moses.",
        "May I help you?",
        "Well, I'm, I'm sorry...[Eddie forces his head in the door] Ahhh. Have we met?",
        "I, I'm sorry, I uh [unchains the door and opens it all the way] I already have a roommate. [Joey turns around in the leather recliner]",
        "Yeah, he's lived here for years, I don't, I don't know what you're talking about man.",
        "Well I, I think we'd remember something like that.",
        "See ya. [shuts the door] Goodbuy you fruit drying psychopath. So you want me to help you unpack your stuff?",
        "Welcome home man. [they hug and jump around]",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Ah that's a cantelope.",
        "Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?",
        "I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?",
        "So is he housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place? Stay. Good, STAY! Good fake dog.",
        "'Cause he was just so darn cute.",
        "Hey, what did your agent say?",
        "And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.",
        "I may have.",
        "Well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet.",
        "I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy...",
        "Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I did.",
        "It's like this, me, no jokes.",
        "Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.",
        "Joey, no means no!",
        "I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.",
        "Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim (sp?, I'm not an art guy) museum. See, she likes art, and I like funny words.",
        "(shyly) It means we're holding hands.",
        "I'm afraid I might just be.",
        "Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.",
        "How do you not fall down more?",
        "All right. (reading her answer) \"My husband is sleeping with his secretary.\" She's married! ",
        "I can't believe she's married.",
        "What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.",
        "What?",
        "Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband.",
        "Okay, I'll do it!",
        "Where is she, Where is she? (grabs Rachel) Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?",
        "(noticing a beautiful blond walking in) Ooh, oh, oh, that's her.",
        "Oh my God! (it's Janice)",
        "Huh. (They all leave, dejected)",
        "Morning.",
        "Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.",
        "Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.",
        "I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.",
        "Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.",
        "Nope, not this time.",
        "I'm not yanking you.",
        "Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.",
        "(looks him in the eye) I'm not breaking up with her! (they stare at each other for a while, then Joey blows in his face)",
        "Hey!",
        "Of!",
        "You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?",
        "No, Janice.",
        "You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?",
        "Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!",
        "Well, there you go.",
        "Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! (Joey stares at him) Don't worry, those are the right letters.",
        "I want you to say that you like her!",
        "Thanks for trying. (grabs the ticket and starts to leave) Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!",
        "Umm, yeah.",
        "Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?",
        "We're not gonna talk about girth are we?",
        "Yeah, okay.",
        "Yeah! All right! You go first.",
        "Okay.",
        "Princess Leia in the gold bikini.",
        "I know!",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.",
        "And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....",
        "I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know...(Ross just stares at him). You don't know!",
        "You said...",
        "What are you guys doing together?",
        "Really.",
        "You still can't stand her can you?",
        "Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.",
        "Well, I guess that's something.",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh God!",
        "Really?",
        "You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!",
        "Well, it's official there are no good movies.",
        "Hey, man. What's up?",
        "Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.",
        "Is anybody else scared?",
        "Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!",
        "(entering with his ringing phone) Joe. Joe! Answer the\n          phone.",
        "Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to\n          have to see her tonight. (phone stops ringing) Oh, that's\n          great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.",
        "Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put\n          half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.",
        "Noo.",
        "No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And\n          this alarm started going off in my head: 'Run for your life!\n          Get out of the building!'",
        "I know, that, (looks at her fake chest, and loses his train\n          of thought, temporarily) that's why I don't want to go\n          tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.",
        "Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be\n          afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the\n          tunnel, to the other side! ",
        "Do we have any...(turns around and bumps Monica's fake chest)\n          Do we have any thoughts here?",
        "You think?",
        "Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a\n          gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.",
        "'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this. (hands her a present)",
        "Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is\n          to go into your brand new drawer. (gives her a drawer) See,\n          the drawer actually goes in my dresser.",
        "Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and\n          that's what girlfriends should, should get. ",
        "Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and\n          there's more. We should take a trip.",
        "Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna\n          meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!",
        "I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life\n          I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like\n          what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in\n          together.' and I'd be okay.",
        "It doesn't scare me!",
        "Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too\n          much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!!\n          (Janice leaves, Chandler then calls Janice to leave a message\n          on her machine) Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just\n          wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the\n          street. (runs out the door)",
        "So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship\n          is going to fast and we have to slow down.",
        "Then I got all needy and clingy.",
        "She said she'd call me.",
        "Oh God.",
        "This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.",
        "So, you don't think I'm terminal?",
        "Okay, okay. So, should I call her?",
        "So I'm not, not gonna lose her?",
        "I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'",
        "(in a British accent) Hello, Janice.",
        "(in accent) Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?",
        "(normal voice) No. Not anymore.",
        "Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some\n          things for a party. (grabs a bag off of the shelf)",
        "Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as\n          yours.",
        "Here in Chelsea.",
        "A woman's",
        "(shyly) Chelsea.",
        "Can I be that guy?",
        "....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at\n          her, and ran out of the store.",
        "I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good\n          ice cream now, right?",
        "(answering phone) Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a\n          second? Okay. (to Monica and Rachel) Okay, what do I do?",
        "Hello!",
        "What are you, stop naming dwarves! (on phone) Hello, Janice.\n          Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a\n          really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about\n          you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid\n          a couple of more times. I'm sorry. (listens) Really?!\n          (listens) Really?!",
        "(on phone) I love you too.",
        "(entering, with a goatee) Hey.",
        "I’m never gonna find a roommate, ever.",
        "Well let’s see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that’s plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!",
        "Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I’m not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone ‘Chandler Bing,’ he said ‘Whoa-whoa, short message.’",
        "Umm, how’s it going with you guys?",
        "Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?",
        "Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.",
        "Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you’re chances are pretty good. (Eric offers to shake hands) All right. (Chandler hugs him.)",
        "(running around the apartment pointing out things) Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, (opens door) Bye-bye.",
        "Sure. Ummm. What’s up?",
        "What gay thing?",
        "Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by.",
        "Hey, Mon.",
        "Do I ever.",
        "No way!",
        "Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?",
        "(to bartender) Can I get a beer.",
        "You betcha!",
        "Um-mm, yeah right!",
        "Oh yes, and that’s what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.",
        "Okay, but after that, we’re shootin’ some pool.",
        "Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.",
        "(picks it up) And now I’ve picked it up again. (walks over to Monica.)",
        "(leaving to go to work) Hey!",
        "Oh, don’t thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.",
        "So ah, whatcha watching?",
        "What’s it about?",
        "Well, it sounds kinda stupid... (looks at the TV) Who’s she?",
        "Wow! Look at them run.",
        "Yeah, I’ll go get one.",
        "Well, hello!",
        "Do you have any beers? We’re out of beers.",
        "You okay?",
        "Right.",
        "Noo!! You don’t have a boyfriend because....I don’t, I don’t know why you don’t have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.",
        "Oh-ho, come here. (goes and hugs her) Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I’ve ever known in real life.",
        "Umm, this is nice.",
        "No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?",
        "Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.",
        "Oh yeah, that sounds great. (starts to leave) Oh, and listen, it’s, it’s gonna be....",
        "Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross. (they shake hands)",
        "I can’t believe you came back.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?",
        "Yeah!",
        "You’re building a post office?",
        "Okay. (notices that Joey is wearing some really tight jeans) My word! Those are snug.",
        "Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?",
        "All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.",
        "Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can’t get mad.",
        "Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit.",
        "I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.",
        "Peter Parker.",
        "(coughing) What a geek!",
        "Hi.",
        "We don’t, really.",
        "You know, we don’t really take advantage of living in the city.",
        "No, you didn’t get me!! It’s an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!",
        "I do NOT want this unit!!",
        "Fine! (goes into his room and slams the door, then he slams the bottom half of the door.)",
        "All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?",
        "Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.",
        "Eh, y'know what, she’s to political, she probably wouldn’t let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.",
        "Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she’s too international, y'know she’s never gonna be around.",
        "So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who’s gonna be in the country like all the time.",
        "(entering) Have you seen Joey?",
        "Oh, just this! (turns around and has a paint lid stuck to the back of his pants.) Y’know what it’s my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.",
        "What’s going on?",
        "Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!",
        "He started mine first!",
        "What, like a number?",
        "Hi! Bye! (runs to the bathroom)",
        "Okay, on three. One....Two....",
        "Why two?",
        "Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this ‘two’ talk.",
        "Okay, one...two...",
        "Oh, good job Joe.",
        "Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!",
        "Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how ‘bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours? (throws his shoulder into the center to try and move it, but it doesn’t move.)",
        "Umm?",
        "I’ve got five bucks says you can’t.",
        "Oh, I think I have the cash.",
        "Yeah, you got me. (picks up a 2x4 and puts it through the handles so that the doors won’t open) I’m out five big ones! (puts the money in the crack between the door and frame) Here you go.",
        "If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best.",
        "(to Janice) Don’t look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!",
        "What a wank!",
        "(leaning in) I’ll go.",
        "See, that’s why I could never be an actor. Because I can’t say gig.",
        "Knock, knock.",
        "Hey, I’m going for sushi does anybody want.. (enters and sees the bed) Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.",
        "Okay. (to Monica) It’s a racecar.",
        "Okay, well it this bed isn’t new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?",
        "You told him to play the boxer gay!!",
        "You totally screwed him over.",
        "Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! (makes a screeching sound as he pretends to stomp on the brakes.) Hey-hey good lookin’! (honks the bed’s little horn on the steering wheel.) Varrrrrrrrroom. (notices Rachel and stops) All right, I’ll leave. My bed’s so boring.",
        "(reading the comics) Eh..., I don’t, I don’t know.",
        "Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?",
        "(thinks about it) Yeah?",
        "Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.",
        "I was shrieking... like a Marine.",
        "(reading the paper) Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. (to Ross) Where exactly were around ten-ish?",
        "Look out kids, he’s coming! (Ross continues to leave with his head down in shame.)",
        "Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it’s the only chance to see New York.",
        "Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?",
        "How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?",
        "He’s right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.",
        "Because, I’m too afraid.",
        "Yeah, that’d be much worse than being 28, and still working here.",
        "(to Joey) Does this mean we’re gonna have to start paying for coffee? (Joey shrugs his shoulders.)",
        "I spelled out boobies.",
        "So, how many have you sold so far?",
        "Oh my God, how did you do that?",
        "Me! On my computer.",
        "Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.",
        "Something else I might have said?",
        "You-you-you don’t wanna give into the fear.",
        "Run, Joey! Run for your life! (runs out)",
        "Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.",
        "(to Rachel, who’s entering) Hey! How’d the interview go?",
        "Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.",
        "Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.",
        "It’s like ‘Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.’",
        "Sure, everybody loves a kidder.",
        "(to Ross) Should I tell her I ordered tea?",
        "I’m an alien. I’m an alien.",
        "No, no, no, I don’t, I don’t really wanna play.",
        "That’s not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don’t say that I don’t have goals!",
        "Yeah, all right, I’ll play.",
        "No, no, no, you say that proudly.",
        "And was the curse lifted?",
        "But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won’t let me cross the street.",
        "And then Tineals.",
        "Wow! Just like in the pros.",
        "The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice. (goes to kick the ball but kicks Ross’s foot instead.)",
        "Sorry. I’m sorry. Y'know what, we’re just gonna throw it.",
        "No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.",
        "(coming up under center, just like a real quarterback does, and puts his hands between Ross’s legs.) Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! (Ross stands up and looks at him) You wanna go shotgun?",
        "(from the shotgun) Hike!",
        "Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.",
        "No, no, no, no, no!",
        "(running up) Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna.. (sees Marhan) Hi, I’m Chandler.",
        "Mar-haaaan.",
        "Well, that went well.",
        "Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.",
        "Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.",
        "Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn’t I wouldn’t have a shot?",
        "Math!! You’re giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we’ll see who gets her.",
        "Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.",
        "Hey! Well, I’ve been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that’s mean!",
        "Before!!",
        "Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?",
        "Okay, good.",
        "(to Margha) Hi.",
        "No-no-no-no, the game’s not over, we’re just switching teams.",
        "No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?",
        "And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?",
        "Fine with me.",
        "Yes!!",
        "Well, you don’t you have Captain Hook explain it to her.",
        "You hear that! That is her chose, mister I’ll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!! (does the wave.)",
        "Wh-what?",
        "Y'know what, it doesn’t matter, ‘cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!",
        "We’re not gonna lose to girls.",
        "Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!",
        "Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you’re five feet short, so we win!",
        "Guys! Guys! Come on! It’s Thanksgiving, it’s not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, (to Joey) the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!",
        "Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.",
        "I will have one. (Ross and him both take one.)",
        "Okay, I’m not gonna have one.",
        "All right I’ll have one. (he and Ross take another\n          brownie,)",
        "See that is the problem with invisible dentists.",
        "That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I\n          look down the hygienist’s blouse.",
        "Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think\n          these pearls are nice?",
        "Janice’s birthday is coming up, I want to get her\n          something speacial. Come in here with me.",
        "That’s a good idea, ‘Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba\n          birthday’. I would like to get her something serious.",
        "All right. Look, I’m gonna go in here, and you don’t buy\n          me anything ever. (starts to go into the store)",
        "Why not?!",
        "What is the thing?",
        "(shocked) What?",
        "Well she, she wouldn’t do that, she’s with, she’s with me.",
        "Yeah, well, you’re wrong! Okay, you’re wrong.",
        "Ah, I don’t know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna\n          tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would,\n          tell me.",
        "You tell me! Maybe, it’s because I was just fooling with\n          my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!",
        "All right!",
        "Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.",
        "No! In his office! How many kisses were there?",
        "Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!?\n          There should be no kissing!!",
        "(giving her a bag) Here.",
        "I’ll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished\n          with me? (Janice shakes her head no) Are you finished with\n          him? (Janice shakes her head no) Do you still love him?\n          (Janice shakes her head yes) Do you still love me? (Janice\n          shakes her head yes) All right look, (grabs the bag) I’m\n          gonna need an actual answer here okay, so which is it, him\n          or me? (his phone starts to ring)",
        "Yeah.",
        "What?",
        "All right.",
        "I talked to Janice.",
        "She doesn’t know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I\n          woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy.\n          Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of\n          condoms. And now I can’t even return them, because she\n          choked on the reciept!",
        "I don’t know, y'know. What, what, would you do?",
        "Come on, tell me.",
        "What? (turns around quickly still ready to throw the dart\n          and Joey quickly ducks and hides behind the chair) What are\n          you, what are you talking about?",
        "Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you\n          to let me get through it, because it’s, it’s, it’s not gonna\n          be easy.",
        "I think you should go back with Gary. I don’t wanna be\n          the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents\n          split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see\n          him I was always think y'know ‘You’re the reason, you are\n          the reason why their not together.’ and I hated that guy.\n          And it didn’t matter how nice he was, or how happy he made\n          my Dad.",
        "Yeah, well. It’s the right thing to do.",
        "Then don’t leave me!",
        "Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!",
        "No you don’t! No, no, no, I say you have to give your\n          divorce another chance.",
        "Ohhh. Don’t go.",
        "No. No! No! No!",
        "I don’t care! (turns around and to the people watching\n          them) I don’t care!!",
        "You can’t leave! I have your shoe!",
        "(singing) ‘I’ll hold you close in my arms. (Phoebe enters) I\n          can’t resist your charms. And love....’",
        "(high pitched) ‘No you know I don’t mind.’",
        "‘I know.’",
        "‘I’ve found.’",
        "(entering) Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?",
        "I just saw Janice.",
        "Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid’s pretzel at them.",
        "Yes, but you ended up having s*x with both of them that afternoon.",
        "Oh, y'know what, I’m gonna be okay, you don’t have to throw a party for me.",
        "Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.",
        "Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it’s supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.",
        "Hello-dillillio!!",
        "(to Monica) Take off your shirt!",
        "Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.",
        "(to Monica) Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?",
        "Hi Joey’s sisters!",
        "Oh, I’m taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.",
        "No-no-no-no, no, it’s a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can’t we savor the precious moments? (to one of Joey’s sisters) Those are some huge breasts you have.",
        "Well, my apartment isn’t there anymore, because I drank it.",
        "Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.",
        "Ow, no ‘woo-hooing,’ no ‘woo-hooing.’",
        "Ah, I fooled around with Joey’s sister. (Phoebe gasps) Well, that’s not the worst part.",
        "I can’t remember which sister.",
        "Okay! You don’t think I thought of that?",
        "(to Monica) You see you can’t tell which one is which either, dwha!!",
        "Veronica. Look, it’s got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.",
        "Look, when I’ve been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I’m sorry.",
        "Why can’t we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.",
        "It’s gotta be the first one.",
        "Yep, I’m in a tree.",
        "Well, that’s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I’ll be in Cuba.",
        "What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?",
        "(shocked) Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?",
        "I’m here to see Mary-Angela.",
        "Where’s Mary-Angela?",
        "This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?",
        "Well, it’s, it’s yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?",
        "So um, Mary-Angela, what’s your second favorite?",
        "Would you just please....give me the receipt ‘cause this is great. It’s top notch.",
        "So will I.",
        "Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn’t mean anything.",
        "Will you excuse me I have to um..... (walks to the hall)",
        "(startled) Hey!",
        "Look, I may have jumped the gun here. (she tries to kiss him, but he ducks it and moves away) Um, I just got out of a relationship and I’m not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.",
        "Ahhhh, you’re not Mary-Angela.",
        "This is so bad. If-if you’re not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?",
        "Oh, this is soo bad. (doesn’t see Mary-Angela)",
        "No Joey! No Joey! Don’t Joey! Joey!",
        "(pats him on the shoulder) You’re it! Now run and hide!",
        "I wasn’t sure which one Mary-Angela was. (all of Joey’s sisters gasp) Look, I’m sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.",
        "Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother’s not going to punch me. (to Joey) Are ya?",
        "Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you’re my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.",
        "Okay, absolutely!",
        "You’ve got it. (he starts to look at his sister’s, but he still doesn’t know which one is Mary-Angela.)",
        "What?! (Cookie punches him)",
        "Don’t worry.",
        "Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.",
        "All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?",
        "I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.",
        "Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?",
        "(to Phoebe) It must take you forever to find your keys.",
        "(to Ross) Hey, so can you make it on Friday?",
        "Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.",
        "Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.",
        "Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! (pause) Don't cry outloud.",
        "I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.",
        "I'll get you the Cliff Notes.",
        "The abridgment.",
        "....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!",
        "Oh no, no, no, no.",
        "All right, I have to get that, but no-no. (answering phone) Hello? (listens) (happily) Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. (listens) Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? (listens) So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?",
        "Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.",
        "To yourself. (finishing) Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good.",
        "Bye-bye.",
        "What, what, what?!",
        "You really think that is what he meant?",
        "Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.",
        "Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.",
        "All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'",
        "He paints quite a picture doesn't he?",
        "Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. (holds up a pen) See, she's fully dressed, right?",
        "And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and (clicks pen) whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked! (Rachel just stares at him.)",
        "Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.",
        "Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some p0rn?",
        "Man, I gotta get a kid. (looks at the pen and starts laughing)",
        "Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.",
        "Yeah, baby!",
        "Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?",
        "Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she’s celebrating that by going on a date with him.",
        "Oh, hey.",
        "(to Robert) So ah, isn’t a bit cold out for shorts?",
        "Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.",
        "(standing up) I’m up! I’m up, I’ve gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?",
        "Okay Ross, why don’t you come with me?",
        "Robert’s coming out.",
        "No. He.....he’s coming out of his shorts.",
        "The man is showing brain.",
        "(to Ross) Wellll?",
        "What do we do? What do we do?",
        "Like an eclipse.",
        "Your liking it, huh?",
        "No, actually Laurie’s a boy.",
        "Hey.",
        "You mean a three pointer?",
        "I’m sorry, I’m sorry, it just seems that Robert isn’t as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.",
        "Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!",
        "Hmmm, that’s very cool.",
        "I can’t believe she cracked your code!",
        "No, Beth doesn’t die, she doesn’t die. Does she Rachel?",
        "We can’t tell him, you can’t go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.",
        "Yeah, we got, um-hmm.",
        "I like her.",
        "Well, that’s pretty much all I’m looking for from these people.",
        "(to Ross) All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I’d like know whether that’s several big fish or just one big fish.",
        "No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called ‘wait until the last moment before I burst and die.’",
        "Jeez, man did you fall..(sees it’s a beautiful woman coming out of the men’s room) Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?",
        "(to Gunther) Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I’m-I’m talking to ah, (tries to get her to say her name). (to her) This is the part where you say your name.",
        "Ginger. I’m talking to Ginger, so....",
        "Nope, nope, I’d just ah, I’d rather talk to you. (pause) Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom. (knocks on the door)",
        "Well, that’s the best kiss I’ve had with anyone I’ve ever met in a men’s room.",
        "(sees her foot is in a slush puddle) Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.",
        "Yeah, we’re gonna have to get you out of those shoes.",
        "No, really you’re gonna freeze.",
        "You’re not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.",
        "Great. It was great. She’s ah, she’s great, great looking, great personality, she’s greatness.",
        "Joey told you about the leg, huh?",
        "Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn’t have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don’t want to stop seeing her, but every so often it’s like ‘Hey, y'know what, where’s your leg?’ I mean I’m the smallest person in the world aren’t I? I’m the smallest person in the world.",
        "(to Monica) Actually he’s the smallest person in the world.",
        "It came up.",
        "No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?",
        "No. No. I don’t think so.",
        "That’s-that’s my nubbin.",
        "It’s kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.",
        "Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... (starts to kiss her again, but she gets up.) Ahh, what?",
        "You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?",
        "(entering, happily) Well hello!",
        "The doctor.",
        "Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.",
        "That was an obvious joke, and I didn’t think of it. Why didn’t I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!",
        "(entering) Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I’m going down to the Xerox place.",
        "Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.",
        "Yeah! You wanna come?",
        "Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!",
        "Uh-oh.",
        "(to Joey) Okay, that hurt us.",
        "Well ah, ........y'know.",
        "All right, rock on. (Does the ‘Hang 10’ sign, then hides his face in shame.)",
        "Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?",
        "What time is it now?",
        "Yeah all right, so we’ll hang out.",
        "Yes. Vividly.",
        "Yeah, I-I-I think so. (Pauses and thinks about it for a second) Yeah, I-I think so...",
        "Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?",
        "She was kidding.",
        "She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.",
        "Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there.... (holds his arm out and pretends to grab something with his hand.)",
        "Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.",
        "Well it you don’t know that, then I don’t want to do this with you.",
        "And that’s the only colour that comes in.",
        "So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.",
        "Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.",
        "Hey, this isn’t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!",
        "Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.",
        "Why? What happened to him?",
        "Oh my God! Oh my God!",
        "Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?",
        "He’s right. Nobody’s gonna benefit, and you’re just gonna hurt her.",
        "All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing’s right. And that’s what deathbeds are for.",
        "Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac’s sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe’s friends with Rachel. And that’s the trail, I did it!",
        "Off?!!",
        "Yeah, well I don’t think you can make that statement, unless you’ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.",
        "Oh, that’s mature.",
        "Nothing, nothing.",
        "Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....",
        "(to Joey) He has s*x, and we get hit in our heads.",
        "Uh-oh.",
        "She was not good. Not good.",
        "Uh-oh.",
        "Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.",
        "Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.",
        "(handing Monica the wax) Wax the door shut, we’re never leaving, ever.",
        "Oh great, food with hair on it.",
        "Because that would be crazy?",
        "Yeah, come on, it’s Ross and Rachel, they’ve got too.",
        "What?",
        "Are you actually saying these words?",
        "Let’s go.",
        "(to Joey) Is that your new walk?",
        "This is the New York Times.",
        "We are. He’s meeting us here.",
        "Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.",
        "Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn’t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.",
        "Y'know what maybe it’s gonna be okay, I mean it’s been a week.",
        "No.",
        "Yes, yes, it’s just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.",
        "Yeah, he’s really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.",
        "(jumps back and points at the cigarette) Oh my God!",
        "Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I’m, I’m smoking still.",
        "Look, I’m telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.",
        "Yeahhh. I’m tellin’ ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....",
        "Oh that’s great, with my luck, that’s gonna be him.",
        "Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism. (answers the door and it’s Rachel again.)",
        "Hey, shut up!! You’re not my real Mom!!",
        "Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.",
        "Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.",
        "(to Joey) Well he’s probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.",
        "What?",
        "Beam me up Jesus.",
        "Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.",
        "Oh, come on, there’s a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.",
        "Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.",
        "Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!",
        "(to Joey) My lighter’s in there! (points to the cab)",
        "Damn! (stands up) The tailpipe’s not hot enough to light this!",
        "Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.",
        "Ladies, ladies, let’s just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica’s bra.",
        "Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.",
        "Okay, now let’s decide who has the nicest ass.",
        "At least let me smoke it to the good part.",
        "I have the lung capacity of a two year old. (starts to light another cigarette.)",
        "Well it’s very unsettling.",
        "Oh no, now it’s not gonna make any sense!",
        "Oh, this is horrible, it’s just horrible.",
        "It’s horrible.",
        "Y'know what, I can handle it, handle’s my middle name. Actually it’s the ah, middle part of my first name.",
        "Guys, guys, guess who I am?! (starts dancing around in an effort to stop the fighting.)",
        "I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.",
        "Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!",
        "My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh, that’s-that’s okay, no problem. (He starts to look around her office.)",
        "Yes, I realise that.",
        "That’s the stuff! (quickly grabs it)",
        "Thanks, it’s ah, Gaelic, for ‘Thy turkey’s done.’ So ah, I’m gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.",
        "Hello.",
        "(holding a tissue) And is this in case the house sneezes?",
        "Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.",
        "Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin’ out the Chan-Chan man!",
        "Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I’ll do it.",
        "(entering) Hey, my Father’s house does that!",
        "Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there’s nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.",
        "Of course, I didn’t get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna’s such a big, dull dud!",
        "(entering with Rachel) I’m telling ya, Joanna’s got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, ‘This was fun. Let’s do it again sometime. I’ll give you a call.’",
        "That’s what you say at the end of a date.",
        "To her face? Look it’s the end of the date, I’m standing there, I know all she’s waiting for is for me to say ‘I’ll call her’ and it’s just y'know, comes out. I can’t help it, it’s a compulsion.",
        "Multiple, so many paper cuts.",
        "(sarcastic) Oh, well give me the phone then.",
        "Look, you can’t call somebody after this long just to say, ‘In case you didn’t notice, I don’t like you!’",
        "Nooo!! She’s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!",
        "All right! Fine! But it’s just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don’t want you setting me up with anybody ever again!",
        "That’s just a lot of big talk, y'know.",
        "It’s not a big deal. It’s, just it’s right here, (points to his eye) and it’s all the time.",
        "(He looks over at Rachel, who nods her head) Yes, this, this was pleasant.",
        "The food there was, was great.",
        "So take care.",
        "Well, this was great. I’ll give you a call. We should do it again sometime. (Rachel is disappointed)",
        "Noo!",
        "Look, I’m sorry. Okay? I’m weak, and pathetic, and sorry.",
        "Ahhhh—I’m not going to call you.",
        "I’m sorry. I’m-I’m-I’m sorry that I said I was going to when I’m not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn’t Rachel’s fault. It’s me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, (pause) mascara goop. And I’m really sorry, it’s just that this is not, this isn’t going to work out.",
        "Yeah, o-okay.",
        "Well this is great! I’ll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!",
        "Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.",
        "Okay.",
        "No-no, why don’t you hang on to that one.",
        "Okay, that’s like the least fun game ever.",
        "Oh. (takes the cassette and puts it on his arm like the stop smoking patch, and it falls off.) Nope, that patch is no good. (Joey and Monica both do their fake laughs.)",
        "Or what my Father called Thursday night.",
        "Y'know, I would’ve bet good money that he’d be the first one of us to get married.",
        "Always illegal Joe.",
        "If that doesn’t keep kids in school, what will?",
        "(entering, carrying a briefcase) Hi.",
        "Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?",
        "Y'know what, pretty good.",
        "Good! I haven’t smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.",
        "Thanks",
        "What check thing?",
        "(reading the check) Pete Becker. Pete… (quickly grabs a magazine and opens it up to show her a picture) (pointing to the picture) Is this him?",
        "Who’s he huggin’?",
        "This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!",
        "There you go!!",
        "(to the girls who are staring at him) What?",
        "(in a feminine way) Oh my God! (and he jumps all around)",
        "Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.",
        "Okay, then get the lobster!",
        "Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.",
        "Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?",
        "Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?",
        "Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.",
        "It’s possible. You are very loveable, I’d miss you if I broke up with you. (Ross glares at him) I was just trying to be supportive.",
        "(in a deep voice) If I broke up with you, I’d miss you.",
        "And you’re our age. You’re our age.",
        "That’s not a state Joe.",
        "You’re our age!",
        "I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn’t matter, I still wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It’s so annoying. Does it bug you?",
        "Is there any chance you didn’t see that?",
        "Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can’t just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You’re gonna get peep eye!",
        "You didn’t just break up.",
        "You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!",
        "Okay.",
        "And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.",
        "Stop what?!",
        "No!! You can’t!!",
        "I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! (Ross is now dragging Chandler and the foosball table to the door) You are surprisingly strong!",
        "Look man!",
        "Listen to me!! (Chandler turns him around and closes and holds the door shut with his feet.)",
        "She’s moving on! Okay, if it’s not this guy, it’s gonna be somebody else! And unless you’re thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It’s over.",
        "Okay.",
        "I know. (He rubs Ross’s head)",
        "I don’t think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. (He blows on his hand) Draw!! (He quickly pulls the lever to raise the foot rest, like a gunfighter in a Western.)",
        "(to Joey) I wasn’t doing anything. (Joey starts angrily throwing his stuff down.) Uh-oh, what did she do now?",
        "Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.",
        "I think somebody has a crush on somebody.",
        "I’m talking about you. You big, big freak.",
        "Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you’d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!",
        "‘Cause it’s-it’s not his last name.",
        "No, it’s not like, like Phil Spiderman. He’s a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there’s no Gold Man.",
        "So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?",
        "What about things that are already gold?",
        "Okay, let’s play my game now.",
        "(sporting a goatee) Hey.",
        "Oh, so that’s why the priest threw holy water on me.\n          (there’s no reaction from Joey) Okay, listen, you have to\n          cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean\n          anything is better than sitting around here crying all day\n          about Kate.",
        "Hey.",
        "No way!",
        "Oh my God! Who’s gonna watch that?!",
        "Yeah. (they start to leave)",
        "Thanks. (He takes off the vest and throws it on the floor.)",
        "So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did\n          it take for the roller skating thing to happen.",
        "Okay, so I guess that’s about ah, two weeks before the\n          topless thing kicks in.",
        "Hey!",
        "Okay. (He opens it and it’s a baby chick) It’s a chicken.",
        "Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.",
        "Easy Lenny.",
        "Okay, but this is the last time. (singing) With a chick-chick\n          here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick,\n          everywhere a chick-chick-(Joey enters)-chickeeeen.",
        "Hey.",
        "She?",
        "I don’t know. (He picks the chick up and turns it over,\n          trying to determine the s*x of the chick, and blows on it.)\n          I can’t tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.",
        "Excuse me?",
        "I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so\n          somebody could be here with our chick!",
        "You don’t think I get up when you get up?",
        "Yes, here it comes! I’m stuck here all day, and then you\n          come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go\n          off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don’t think so\n          mister!",
        "And you don’t think taking care of our chick is work?",
        "I know what you meant!! (pause) You notice that ever since\n          we got this chick, we’ve been fighting a lot more than we\n          used too?",
        "I’ll take her back tomorrow.",
        "Hey!",
        "(rushing in) Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a\n          chick out of a VCR?!",
        "I know. See, yes. That’s Yasmine Bleeth, she’s a completely\n          different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very\n          different ways.",
        "Hey!",
        "I did! But the store wouldn’t take her back! So then I took\n          her to the shelter, and you know what I found out? ",
        "If they can’t find a home for her, they kill her! And I’m\n          not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!",
        "Okay. And it’s not just chicks y'know? It’s all kinds of\n          other animals!",
        "Thanks, I’m glad you see it that way.",
        "Ohhh-hoo, funny story!",
        "Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you\n          did!!",
        "That’s a bad duck!!! (to Ross) How’d the thing go tonight,\n          Ross?",
        "(to the duck) Okay, now when you come back I hope you\n          remember that, that chick is not a toy! (He goes back into\n          the apartment)",
        "(coming out of his apartment and seeing Ross) What did you\n          do?",
        "Having a swim.",
        "Chicks don’t swim.",
        "I don’t know. Should we try it?",
        "See, I told you they don’t swim. (He goes to take it out)",
        "Noo! (takes him out) Oh, it’s okay, it’s okay, baby, baby,\n          baby.",
        "Do you think that there’s a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as you’re driving into town there’s-there’s like a sign, and it says “You’re in Sample.” (He says it like urine sample.)",
        "Yeah, it’s two guys in a ring, and the rules are: “They’re are no rules.”",
        "Yes, but there’s two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.",
        "Oh it’s Bing, sir. I’m sorry , I was just ah...",
        "All right buddy, way to go! (smacks him on the butt)",
        "Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.",
        "Well, I didn’t do anything. I didn’t want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.",
        "Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between ‘em.",
        "(to Ross and Monica) What if Joey were president?",
        "(to his co-workers) What is with him?",
        "Well, that’s not true, he-he smacked you once.",
        "No sir.",
        "(joining them) Hey! Which one’s my turkey burger?",
        "Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it’s gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I’m conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.",
        "Excuse me, Doug? (no reaction) Hey there sports fan!!",
        "No, I ah, I didn’t do them.",
        "No, no I just ah, didn’t do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don’t deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.",
        "Doug!!",
        "I’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.",
        "No, no. It-it’s not about the swearing, it’s more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.",
        "Oh, and don’t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It’s just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it’s making all the other guys jealous.",
        "Okay. (he starts to leave)",
        "Ahhhhh! (walks out, imitating shooting himself in the head)",
        "Thank you, sir.",
        "No. No, not at all, that’s-that’s ridiculous.",
        "Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!",
        "Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!",
        "Or... Dick.",
        "Was it like a sneeze only better?",
        "No!!",
        "Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! (sees it) Huh.",
        "No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a…",
        "Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.",
        "Hey!",
        "Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.",
        "You're right, I know.",
        "(joining them) Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?",
        "Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.",
        "Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.",
        "Well sensitive is important, pick him.",
        "(sitting down on the couch) I-kea! This is comfortable.",
        "So, what do you thing the good news is?",
        "Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He’s not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that’s like a third or fourth date kinda thing.",
        "Oh, so you’re going with the teacher, huh?",
        "(comforting the duck) Everything’s gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?",
        "Ye-e-es!!",
        "Who’s number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.",
        "Bye!",
        "Yeah, and I don’t have any cologne.",
        "Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.",
        "(entering, carrying the chick and duck) Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?",
        "Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.",
        "(seeing Joey) There he is!",
        "Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.",
        "I know.",
        "So that’s the girl you like.",
        "Wait a minute, wait a minute, you don’t like the guy Rachel’s dating? Well, that’s odd.",
        "Could I borrow it?",
        "Oh-ho-ho-ho.",
        "7:15. (Monica looks at him) Watch doesn’t work.",
        "Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like, (claps his hands) banging his hands together!",
        "Ross, don’t. Ross!",
        "Ohh, that’s a good one.",
        "Why don’t you use ours across the hall, ‘cause she…has…problems.",
        "Step away from the duck.",
        "And yet, she’s still not hanging up the phone.",
        "(to Bonnie) So ah, your first sexual experience was with a\n          woman?!",
        "Tell it again. (pause, we see Rachel is not amused.)\n          Seriously.",
        "(reading the back of the picture) Me and Frank and Phoebe,\n          Graduation 1965.",
        "You’re not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster\n          cook.",
        "Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I’ll be your\n          boyfriend.",
        "Why is that so funny?",
        "Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend\n          material?",
        "Okay, so we’ve established my name, and hit me. But\n          theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren’t friends, say\n          it’s a blind date. I show up at your door, and I’m like (in\n          a fake voice) \"Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey.\"",
        "Hey!",
        "What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat!\n          They did experiments on me! I can’t have children!!",
        "Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?",
        "Big bullies!!",
        "Hey!",
        "Bored and bored!",
        "Yes!",
        "Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.",
        "So, you still don’t think I’m boyfriend material?",
        "I saw you checking me out during the game last night.",
        "Yeah, well, lucky for you.",
        "I don’t know.",
        "Oh, yeah, I don’t know what they were doing, but at one\n          point sea turtles actually came up to the house.",
        "Where ya going?",
        "(to Joey) Noo!! I don’t care! I’m not, I’m not gonna playing\n          one-on-one strip poker with you for practice! ",
        "G’night.",
        "Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don’t need\n          that kind’ve hurt. Take it from a guy who’s never had a\n          long term relationship......",
        "Ahhhh! (Steps away from her.)",
        "Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.",
        "There is not one hair on that head.",
        "(in a fake voice) Hi there.",
        "Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you’re gonna wanna date\n          this next guy, I swear!",
        "Hi! I’m Dorf! You’re date for the evening. (Monica walks\n          away in disgust) Oh come on! Dorf on dating, that’s good\n          stuff!!",
        "Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!",
        "You don’t turn and slide, you throw it out! I’m tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!",
        "All right, how about we, how ‘bout we sell it.",
        "(nods his head) Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? (to Joey) They seem all right with it!",
        "Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.",
        "(reading the ad) Stunning entertainment center. Fine, (pause) fine Italian craftsmanship. (Joey is very proud of himself)",
        "You want it?",
        "Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?",
        "All right look, I’m changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.",
        "(looks at him) Nooo.",
        "I can’t believe you don’t know what I do for a living!",
        "(interrupting) Let it go!!",
        "Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.",
        "You’ll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.",
        "Y'know, I, I really don’t think we need a canoe.",
        "All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!",
        "Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he’s wrong.",
        "Oh-no, he’s right.",
        "I’m coming already!!",
        "OH MY GOD!!!",
        "Are you all right?!",
        "(lets him out) What happened?!!",
        "What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!",
        "So--You got in voluntarily?!",
        "BEND OVER?!!!",
        "Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!",
        "Oh, they said uh, “You don’t have insurance here, so stop calling us.”",
        "Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we’d really appreciate it. (Joey nods in agreement)",
        "Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn’t say ‘cool’ anymore.",
        "Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I’ve missed the last 1200 times.",
        "You don’t think I’ve tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.",
        "Oh Maria. You can’t say no to her, she’s like this lycra spandex covered gym…treat.",
        "No!",
        "Oh no, you’ll have to come.",
        "Why don’t you just give him to somebody else?",
        "Because that’s the only part of you he can see when he’s on the table!",
        "Yes. (In a stronger voice) Yes!",
        "No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!",
        "Okay. (They go inside) (To the guy at the desk) I wanna quit the gym.",
        "I wanna quit the gym.",
        "(He turns to Ross and Ross makes a ‘Be strong’ sound.) I wanna quit the gym.",
        "(horrified at the prospect of trying to quit alone and unsure about himself) I wanna quit the gym.",
        "Hey.",
        "No, I almost did, couldn’t leave Ross there without a spotter!",
        "We’re doomed. Okay, they’re gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?",
        "You’re a genius!",
        "Now, there’s two reasons.",
        "Thank you, Joey.",
        "Hi.",
        "No, we’d just like to close them.",
        "I wanna quit the bank!",
        "To pay for the gym.",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah… Bunny-rabbit.",
        "Oh no-no-no, I’m, I’m paddling away!",
        "Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!",
        "Could we be more white trash?",
        "Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.",
        "Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.",
        "(laughs) No. No!",
        "Well, not at first.",
        "Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.",
        "Oh, come on! It’s not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I’m pretty much just in there by myself.",
        "Okay, I promise, I’ll end it.",
        "I hope you know what I’m giving up for ya, because she’s not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.",
        "…it was like the Algonquin kids table. (They all laugh, but Joey only laughs not to be left out.)",
        "It just doesn’t…feel like we’re breaking up.",
        "Okay.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Okay. (Starts to button up his shirt)",
        "I’m getting dressed.",
        "When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.",
        "What is it?",
        "Ah-ha, you’re not the boss of me. (She kisses him) Yeah, you are! (She handcuffs him to the chair) Ooh, saucy.",
        "You are, you’re gonna leave me like this?",
        "Okay. But if you don’t come back soon, (She leaves and closes the door) there’s pretty much nothing I can do about it!",
        "Hi! (to Sophie) How are you?",
        "Hello, Joanna…(Realises he doesn’t know her last name)…’s office.",
        "How little?!",
        "Look, this isn’t funny! You get back here right now!",
        "Why not?!",
        "What?!",
        "(in a serious, businesslike tone) Rachel, could I see you for a moment?",
        "Okay, here’s the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.",
        "I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!",
        "It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.",
        "No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can’t get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I’m cold, and (Stops and looks up the skirt on a statue behind Joanna’s desk.)",
        "Never!",
        "Fine!",
        "I—never borrowed your Walkman.",
        "You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! (Rachel goes over and unlocks the handcuffs) Ahhh! (He starts rubbing his wrist)",
        "No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. (He runs over to where his pants are hanging) Hello sweet pants!",
        "About what?",
        "I’ll make something up! I’m good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!",
        "Oh-ho-ho, I don’t think so!",
        "Well, this is much better.",
        "Hey, look, you’re in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she’s gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.",
        "It still wouldn’t be clean. (Rachel makes an ‘Eww, disgusting!’ face) All I want is my freedom.",
        "Freedom!",
        "Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won’t you here me?! (Opens the door) Sophie, help me! Help me!! (Sophie stands up)",
        "I’m gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just… (He moves his arm which opens the drawer and hits in the back of the head, which proves his point.)",
        "No!",
        "With extra pulp?",
        "No!",
        "You don’t have it.",
        "How do Monica and Phoebe know?",
        "(intrigued) Go on.",
        "And Milton Berle has a…",
        "(hello) Hello.",
        "(to Rachel) I love you. (Kisses her on the forehead)",
        "(checks his watch) Two hours, that lasted!",
        "I think so.",
        "Could there be more Kims?",
        "(to Monica) (in a funny voice) Hi there. (Monica turns her head away in disgust)",
        "(jumping up) Oh, I’ll go out and get you some.",
        "Nope! Because I’m not your boyfriend. (to Phoebe, who’s entering) Hey Pheebs, how did it go?",
        "I found a dried up seashores.",
        "All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?",
        "I’ve got canned goods.",
        "Excellent hole, Joe.",
        "Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!",
        "We’ve got to do something!",
        "Y'know what, he’s right. There’s something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.",
        "Me too!!",
        "Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I’m gonna break up with you!",
        "Look, Ross, you have what you want, you’re back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you’re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.",
        "(jumping up) Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!",
        "I’ll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.",
        "(running over and joining Monica) They’ll never understand!",
        "(following Monica) We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn’t think we could make it. (He goes to put his hands on Monica’s shoulders but for some reason can quite complete the action and pulls back.)",
        "And then Joey remembered something.",
        "(wails loudly into his hands) Joey kept screaming at me, “Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!” Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.",
        "(entering with Joey) (to Monica) Coffee house?",
        "I KNEW IT!!!!",
        "We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.",
        "Okay. All right.",
        "Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.",
        "Where did you, when did you, how did you... (Joey hits the back of Chandler's head) How did you get a girl like that?",
        "Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.",
        "Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?",
        "Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.",
        "Well, I have a call in about that.",
        "Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.",
        "Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.",
        "Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.",
        "It doesn't say that. Does it?",
        "Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.",
        "It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. (Kathy goes into the bathroom.) Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?",
        "(confused) Sure...",
        "I don't know... um, Grease?",
        "Rent?",
        "Okay, so when do you want to go?",
        "Yes, it is, at Office Max.",
        "A pen.",
        "Huh-huh! You can't give her that.",
        "Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!",
        "All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?",
        "For three years?",
        "All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?",
        "Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?",
        "Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.",
        "Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called \"Invisible things for Kathy.\" (Motions to an imaginary pile of presents next to him.) Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?",
        "She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.",
        "Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?",
        "Where?",
        "I got something for her. (Joey picks up the package, shakes it next to his ear, can't hear anything, switches ears, shakes it again.) It's a book!",
        "No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?",
        "No, it came out to an even twenty.",
        "Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?",
        "Oh yeah? That's great!",
        "[nodding, with mixed feelings] Aahhuuhhh....",
        "Hey! Happy birthday.",
        "No he didn't. [Moving it back.]",
        "Happy birthday! I'm sorry.",
        "See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.",
        "Oh, yeah... yeah.",
        "[to Kathy] Goodnight.",
        "Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.",
        "Uh, the book?",
        "What do you mean?",
        "(tongue-tied) Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, \"Uhl, ell.\"",
        "Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.",
        "Goodnight. (Goes to his room.)",
        "Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.",
        "I could die.",
        "I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.",
        "Hey! (Phoebe sneezes)",
        "All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?",
        "(gets up) (softly) Wish me luck.",
        "Wish it! (To the woman, Kathy, he likes) Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?",
        "Uh Kathy, with K or a C?",
        "Oh-oh-hey!",
        "Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.",
        "Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey. (Joey kisses Kathy.)",
        "Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.",
        "(sees Kathy is up watching TV) Hi!",
        "Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.",
        "Oh my God! That's why I got up too!",
        "Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...",
        "So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.",
        "That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.",
        "Is it on?",
        "Hey! (Runs over and gets his wonder broom)",
        "Oh! It's on! It's on!",
        "There we go little fella.",
        "Well the duck can swim.",
        "Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.",
        "She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?",
        "No, I don't.",
        "Thank you, Ross.",
        "All right.",
        "All right.",
        "Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! (She doesn't hear him and keeps running, Chandler starts chasing her as the theme to The Mod Squad starts to play. First, a car almost hits him and then gets mustard splashed on him as he runs by a hot dog vendor.) Kathy! (He keeps running and gets tangled up in the leashes of five dogs, in desperation he throws his paper.) Fetch! Fetch it! (He frees himself and resumes the chase) Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! (He now trips and falls into a pile of garbage, he tries to get up and scream her name again but he has a piece of spinach in his mouth. He gets out of the garbage and starts crossing the street by running over the hoods of a couple of cabs.) Kathy! (He jumps in front of her and out of breath he says) Kathy.",
        "Oh, I just wanted to say, \"Hey!\"",
        "Okay. (He walks away disgusted with himself.)",
        "(entering) Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.",
        "I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. (he waits for a reaction, when he doesn't get one) No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!",
        "Really?!",
        "(laughs) Right in there!",
        "99...100! Ready or not, here I come! (He opens his eyes and sees that the chick and the duck are still sitting in front of him) All right, let's go over the concept one more time.",
        "Hey!",
        "Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.",
        "Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.",
        "You-you do?",
        "You got me.",
        "Yeah. Right.",
        "Okay.",
        "Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.",
        "Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.",
        "Uhh, no-no thanks.",
        "Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer. (Leaves)",
        "What?",
        "Hey, look, what do you want from me?",
        "I am pretending.",
        "Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? (Joey gives him a thumbs up) No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!",
        "Can I sleep on your couch?",
        "(on phone) Hey, it’s me. I know you can’t stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I’d try and apologize over the phone. All I… (Joey hangs up the phone in disgust.)",
        "Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I’m… (Joey hangs up the phone again.)",
        "(entering) Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!",
        "They couldn’t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.",
        "Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, ‘cause I wanna trade for her.",
        "Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?",
        "Oh that’s not true! That’s not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it… (notices the look on Monica and Phoebe’s faces.) Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it… (Phoebe looks confused.) Her initials…",
        "Op, y'know what though, it’s kind’ve a girlie briefcase.",
        "Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!",
        "Thanks.",
        "Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.",
        "Well maybe you should put some ice on it.",
        "He’s really picky about his patients.",
        "(entering) All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! (Ross is pleased.) I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.",
        "Oh y’know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.",
        "I don’t know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.",
        "Oh no-no-no, you don’t want to do that, then you’re gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.",
        "Like?",
        "When was the last time you saw her wear it?",
        "Big dog?",
        "I walk into a room and he won’t even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.",
        "Hey Joe.",
        "Hey! I’m sorry! That—(sees that Joey is about to leave) where are you going?",
        "Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?",
        "What?!",
        "Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I’ll stop seeing her?",
        "Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!",
        "All right look, if you’re not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!",
        "What?",
        "All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. (Joey looks intrigued) What?",
        "(He is now in the box, in their living room.) Sounds like a really bad idea to me.",
        "The meaning of the box is three fold. One (holds a finger up through the air hole), it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two (holds up another finger), it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three (holds up a third finger), it hurts!",
        "Air hole! Air hole!! (Ross retracts his hand quickly.)",
        "How do ya do.",
        "What happened? What happened?!",
        "Gotcha! (laughs)",
        "Sorry!",
        "Okay, okay, you got it!",
        "You can’t tell, but I’m trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!",
        "You’re right, and I’m sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won’t say another word tonight.",
        "Absolutely!",
        "So?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Man, this is…",
        "(entering in a bathrobe) I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!",
        "It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it’s bad enough that I’m in love with my roommates girlfriend—which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we’re in the room together there’s this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I’ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she’s smooth! Smooth! (leaves)",
        "(rushing up) Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?",
        "Goin’ out, huh? Wow! Wow! (Does a little celebration dance) So things didn’t work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.",
        "(shocked) What?",
        "Wait! You’re going out with Kathy!",
        "Well, I’m upset—for you. I mean, having s*x with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (He can’t believe he just sad that.)",
        "Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she’s-she’s smart, and funny, and gets you.",
        "All right look, I think it’s time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.",
        "All right! Bring it on, you…",
        "(interrupting) Oh my God! Play!",
        "Really, bitchin’!",
        "You mean like, music?",
        "Yeah, I know what you’re thinkin’! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.",
        "Come in!",
        "Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.",
        "No-no, he’s not back yet, but he’ll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?",
        "I like it in the stern. (Realizes what he just said.) …of the boat. (The phone rings, and he answers it.) (on phone) Hello.",
        "What happened?",
        "Why can’t you tell her?",
        "Joey! Joey!!",
        "I thought your time ran out.",
        "(to Kathy) Uhh, that was Joey. He’s running a little late, he says he’s sorry.",
        "So I guess it’s just uh, you and me then.",
        "Yeah, I think it is!",
        "Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut…",
        "…and then it got canceled.",
        "Really?! You do that?",
        "Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don’t make my tail too poofy.",
        "Well, thanks. I grow it myself. (Kathy is running her fingers through his hair, and Chandler catches himself enjoying it too much.) Y’know who also has great hair is Joey!",
        "What-what ‘cha doin’?",
        "‘Kay.",
        "(jumping up to answer the phone) Oh the phone! The phone’s making sounds! (On phone) Hello!",
        "Hey it’s Joey!",
        "What?",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh yeah man. (to Kathy) Joey. (Hands her the phone.)",
        "Yeah. Yes! Yeah.",
        "Oh.",
        "No-no-no-no, this is bad! It’s bad! This is bad!",
        "Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?",
        "Okay!",
        "Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here’s what we do, we-we forget it happened.",
        "Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we’re unhappy forever. Sound good?",
        "I have to; he’s my best friend, and you’re seeing him.",
        "(interrupting) Oh-no-no-no! Don’t! Don’t! See-see, you’re getting me confused, I’m starting to urn.",
        "I-I think we have too.",
        "Bye. (Kathy leaves and Chandler wonders over to and leans up against the door.) Are you still out there?",
        "Hang on buddy! (He goes over and unlocks the door and opens it to reveal a fully furnished apartment.)",
        "I sure did.",
        "Well, I just thought it’d make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.",
        "Oh no-no-no. This is amazing. (He goes over and presses a button on a remote control that opens the entertainment center doors revealing the TV.)",
        "Well, y’know I’m 29. I mean who needs a savings account.",
        "Oh, I don’t know.",
        "You mean with Casey.",
        "Or Casey.",
        "Could be Casey.",
        "Consider Casey.",
        "That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!",
        "I kissed Kathy.",
        "No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he’ll understand this?",
        "Oh, don’t say that! Don’t say that. That’s not true. Is it?",
        "Then why didn’t you tell me to do that?!!",
        "God!! (Sits down in disgust.) What am I gonna do?!",
        "Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!",
        "Yeah, I know.",
        "Hey!",
        "Is that a real thing?",
        "Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.",
        "It’s-it’s about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.",
        "Yeah.",
        "What?",
        "Oh uh, when?",
        "Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?",
        "Yes, but I-I uh, don’t have too.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.",
        "See uh, that’s-that’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.",
        "It’s me. I’m the other guy.",
        "Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and…",
        "No! No! No! I just kissed her.",
        "How is that worse?!",
        "Look, I’m sorry! But there’s nothing I can do, I think I’m in love with her!",
        "You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.",
        "Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!",
        "Probably because…",
        "Our eyes are closed and we’re about to cross the street. Very good.",
        "(entering) Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?",
        "No-no, I don’t think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!",
        "Kathy’s with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!",
        "I’m gonna call and get off work tomorrow!",
        "This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!",
        "Oh man! I am so excited—I may vomit!",
        "Look you don’t understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y’know you’re never know what’s gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!",
        "Oh yeah, it’s beautiful country up there.",
        "It’s not gonna be exactly like last time.",
        "Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!",
        "(answering it) Hello. (listens) (to Ross) It’s Gandolf!!! (on phone) So, are you in town? (listens) (disappointed) Oh, well, well maybe next time then. (Hangs up)",
        "He’s not gonna make it, he’s stuck in Chicago.",
        "Stupid, useless Canadian money!",
        "Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.",
        "Oh-no, y’know with Gandolf we’d be out all night!",
        "And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?",
        "All right!!",
        "Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?",
        "Well, those were seals, man.",
        "Yeah, all right.",
        "Actually, me too.",
        "Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?",
        "Y’know what? We’re not sad, we’re not sad, we’re just not 21 anymore. Y’know? I’m 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!",
        "Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?",
        "Were you so late because you were burring this woman?",
        "How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie? (laughs, at they all look at him) That joke would’ve killed in Albany.",
        "Hey, look at this! (Holding a newspaper) They’re lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.",
        "All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can’t believe I missed it.",
        "Really?! I didn’t think girls ever just wanted a fling.",
        "Y’know what? There’s some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?",
        "Well, I have a girlfriend, I’m-I’m happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.",
        "Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?",
        "Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who’s boss.",
        "(he glares at him for a while) Yes.",
        "I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? (Drew looks at him) Og-ee-op, I’m not asking for me, I’m… I mean… No, I’m-I’m not gay, I’m not asking you out. I’m not-I’m not-I’m not gay!",
        "See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.",
        "Oh, y’know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.",
        "(to Drew) Oh, by the way, that is her full name.",
        "Oh well, that’s uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!",
        "Well, I don’t really know what that is, but let’s!!",
        "(entering) Hello, children!",
        "(to Rachel) Have I got the 50 guys for you!",
        "Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They’re buying me drinks! They’re giving me stuff! (to Joey) Knicks tonight?",
        "Wherever! I’ve got like 20!",
        "Y’know what, I’m gonna uh, play the field just a little more.",
        "Guys are signing over their 401-K’s to me?",
        "(pause) Yes. (to Rachel) Okay, there’s this one guy, Patrick, I think you’re gonna like him, he’s really nice, he’s funny, he’s a swimmer.",
        "Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.",
        "See, I’m not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?",
        "Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.",
        "It’s a big company, I don’t—if you—I…",
        "Oh yeah! With who?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hey, man!",
        "Well, like father, like son.",
        "Really?! I-I thought you weren’t looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.",
        "Ummmmmmmm, no.",
        "Why not?! I’d be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get—oh I see.",
        "(interrupting) Oh, y’know, y’know what Pheebs?",
        "I’m not Jewish, so…",
        "Bad dream?",
        "Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe’s song about?",
        "Prague?",
        "I did! I absolutely did!",
        "I’m sure you’re right, but why?",
        "Oh, man. I’m sorry, I’m so-so sorry.",
        "I know! I know!",
        "Well, y’know, you’re-you’re gonna meet somebody! You’re a great catch! Y’know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn’t have to lie once. (He sits down on the arm of her chair)",
        "Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?",
        "Oh, it doesn’t matter. (Kisses her on the top of her head.) Hey, y’know what, I’ve got two tickets to tonight’s Rangers game, you wanna come with me?",
        "Well, actually it’s a hockey team, so it’s angry Canadians with no teeth.",
        "Have you ever been with a woman?",
        "So there is no good time to ask that question.",
        "I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black. [stops]",
        "Blue blazer *back*. He, he wants it *back*.",
        "Well, you, you know what I meant.",
        "[Chandler glares at her and then changes the subject.] So what job did you get Joe?",
        "You're going to carry their child and get them a Sony Play Station?",
        "Oh, yeah, sure. It's not mine anyway. It came with the pants.",
        "Yes. Right where?",
        "Yeah, you've, you've got to love the talking.",
        "Oh, we haven't had s*x yet. Okay, but what's the big deal, you know? This is special, and I want our love to grow, before we move to the next level.",
        "No, he's right, I'm totally lying.",
        "Well, Kathy's last girlfriend was Joey.",
        "No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him.",
        "Yes and I was saying the actual words.",
        "We share a wall. So either he's great in bed or she just liked to agree with him a lot.",
        "Yeah?",
        "[gets up to leave] All right, all right, I'll sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys. [leaves]",
        "[enters] Hey. Why's Phoebe singing to Karl Malden?",
        "[dejectedly] Yes, yes, we had the s*x.",
        "It was fine, you know, but she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, uh, \"Oh, I see your point. I'm all right with it.\"",
        "Look, you have to help me, okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman. I know where everything goes. It's always...nice. But I need to know what makes it go from \"nice\" to \"My God, somebody's killing her in there!\"",
        "You don't have to draw an actual wo -- [looks at Monica's drawing] Woah, she' hot.",
        "[shocked] There are seven?",
        "[points to diagram] That's one?",
        "Oh, you know what, I was looking at it upside down.",
        "And that's bad?",
        "Well you might if it were anything like seven.",
        "Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have s*x with the star of the play!",
        "I know!!",
        "Wow! She looks great. Doesn’t she?",
        "Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!",
        "Yeah, it’s like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!",
        "I’m totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they’re gonna go to their cast parties and he’s gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it’ll be like, \"So where’s your boyfriend, what’s-his-name, Chester?\" And she’ll go, \"No-no-no, it’s Chandler.\" And he’ll go, \"Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!\"",
        "All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?",
        "Really?",
        "So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?",
        "Yeah, I know but…",
        "Okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I’m fairly certain are the same thing.",
        "I’m right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there’s no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!",
        "Come on, it was like cousins having s*x up there!",
        "Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you’re having s*x with him.",
        "Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!",
        "Y’know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you’re up there every night, you’re naked, touching, kissing.",
        "Well, you can understand, given how we started.",
        "Well, that is what happened, and I don’t even see you denying this!",
        "Yeah, well, don’t expect that to happen anytime soon!",
        "Steps! (He opens the door to his apartment to Ross and Joey looking at the new Playboy) Slut! (Ross and Joey quickly hide the Playboy behind their backs. Chandler wonders into the girl’s apartment.) You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!",
        "I confronted her, and she didn’t deny it! (Pause) I don’t live here! (Goes back into his apartment and they all follow him.)",
        "Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie’s…",
        "Yes! See you and I have always been like—(motions that they think the same.)",
        "Did she call?",
        "All right, maybe I should call her.",
        "Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?",
        "Well y'know, what if she didn’t actually sleep with the guy?",
        "She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!",
        "That’s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.",
        "Oh my God!!",
        "Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I’m sorry. Y’know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.",
        "Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y’know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? ‘Cause we’ve had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y’know, I know for me—(Notices a pair of men’s pants on the chair.) Nick’s pants?",
        "Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!",
        "Well, she wasn’t sleeping with him.",
        "She is now.",
        "I’m saying that she… is a devil woman! Y’know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don’t hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.",
        "Because, I-I should’ve called! Y’know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would’ve gone out with Nick, and they would’ve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!",
        "You!",
        "Well the vet seems to think that’s she’s becoming a rooster. (The rooster crows.) We’re getting a second opinion.",
        "Oh, I can uh, check that for ya.",
        "I can check that for ya.",
        "Well… we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.",
        "(to Rachel) And you… Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel’s bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.",
        "Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.",
        "(to Ross) Stop that now!",
        "Yes!",
        "Diet soda.",
        "Orange juice.",
        "Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh! (Whispers something in Joey’s ear.)",
        "I got it! Scotch… tape. (They’re right.)",
        "Well, we used there’s up last night making scary faces.",
        "All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.",
        "Fears and Pet Peeves.",
        "His legs flail about as if independent of his body!",
        "She has a real name.",
        "Althea?! What are you doing?!",
        "You're shooting with Althea?!",
        "Nice shooting!",
        "Actually, it’s Miss Chinandolor Bong.",
        "Unfortunately that is correct.",
        "I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we’re gonna destroy you.",
        "Well, I’m so confused as to what we’ve been doing so far…",
        "Say 200?",
        "(interrupting) All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds.",
        "But if we win, we get your apartment.",
        "Okay. (Starts jumping around.)",
        "Dangerous Liaisons.",
        "Oh! (Whispers something in Joey’s ear and then in Ross’s ear.)",
        "Fancy.",
        "Fancy guest.",
        "Thanks man.",
        "You can’t just call Monica’s room.",
        "Oh, I would never bet this apartment. It’s too nice.",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah, but I bet it works.",
        "Well believe it baby!",
        "I knew it!",
        "Cool, girl roommate.",
        "Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!",
        "What?! What-what is it?!",
        "I can’t believe we live here!",
        "You don’t have to stop having fun just because I’m here. Kathy didn’t cheat on all of you. (To Joey) Well, except you. (They hug and Chandler goes into the bathroom with the chick and duck following him.)",
        "(opening the bathroom door and kicking out the chick and duck) Would you give me one minute!! Please.",
        "Y’know, I can’t believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I’m never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!",
        "That’s right! Where are the guys? I’m ready to get drunk and see some strippers.",
        "They got a breakfast buffet.",
        "Ooh, let me talk to him!",
        "Well, can I just…",
        "She’s shhing me! It’s my phone and she’s shhing me!",
        "Ow!",
        "Maybe, she doesn’t hit him all the time.",
        "Okay, I’m going to go stand over there. (Points and moves into the living room.)",
        "So y’know, uh, when’s he getting back?",
        "Y’know, I knew something like this was going to happen. (He starts to take off his pants, revealing that he is still wearing his sweat pants.)",
        "Yes you can. You’re thinking about time, you can’t go back in time.",
        "(laughs) No you can’t.",
        "You don’t want to be guys, you’d be all hairy and wouldn’t live as long. (Starts to go to his bedroom)",
        "Okay. (Starts to cry)",
        "No thanks, Mom!",
        "Ahh, come on! Y’know what—y’know what, I think I’m just gonna go home and call Kathy.",
        "No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I’m gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, I’m gonna get so drunk, I’m gonna wanna call Janice",
        "Ohhh!!",
        "Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!",
        "All right, well I’m gonna put my sweats back on.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Stripping!",
        "Okay, look, I’m gonna have to ask you all to leave.",
        "Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn’t picture myself with any of them. (Sits back in disgust.)",
        "(jumping up) Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!",
        "I am totally picturing you with all those women!",
        "Well, I’m there too!",
        "Stop it! You’re killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!",
        "Where I don’t want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have s*x with strippers and my friends!!",
        "Come on, let me see that smile.",
        "Please?",
        "I know, I know, but you’re gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.",
        "All right ladies, here’s what we’re gonna do. (Points to a stripper.) You are gonna take off my clothes. (To another two strippers) You two, go get the oils. (To another stripper) And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, \"Chandler’s the king! Chandler’s the king!\"",
        "Oh, that’s fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.",
        "Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!",
        "What do you want from me, I’ve never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, I’m sorry you can’t stay, (Rachel is upset about leaving the orgy with the cigarette guy.) but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. (The cigarette guy starts rubbing Chandler’s back.) What are you doing? (The guy just nods) All right, listen, I’ve got to wake up!",
        "You said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!",
        "That’s a mailman! That’s our mailman! (Waves to the mailman) (Sarcastic) Hi. How are ya?",
        "Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?",
        "(entering, with Janice in tow) Hello!",
        "Isn’t this amazing?",
        "Okay. Bye.",
        "Bye.",
        "Bye.",
        "B-bye!",
        "Bye. (Finally closes the door on her.) (After it’s closed) I can’t stand the woman! (Phoebe is shocked, Joey is relieved.)",
        "Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality—Well, they’re all back! Y’know? And she’s picked up like nine new ones!",
        "Don’t worry about it. I’m taking care of it tonight. (Chandler opens the fridge and grabs something to drink.)",
        "(standing in the door of the fridge) Well, I don’t have to break up with her this time. We’re not involved! I’m going to do a pre-emptive strike! I’m going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen! (Closes the fridge.)",
        "Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.",
        "(laughs) Okay, we have to talk. I’m just getting out of a very serious relationship…",
        "Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.",
        "I hear ya. (Pause) But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!",
        "No! No! Not, Paris.",
        "Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? (Thinks) Yemen. That’s right, yes, I’m being transferred to Yemen!",
        "I don’t know exactly.",
        "But I do know that it’s some time tomorrow.",
        "Y’know uh, you didn’t really have to help me pack.",
        "Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!",
        "Oh, I’m packing. Y’know I’m-I’m packing ‘cause I’m moving to Yemen tomorrow.",
        "I’m only going to pretend I’m moving to Yemen, it’s the only way I can get rid off her.",
        "(to Janice) Okay. (to Joey) Joey, trade lives with me!",
        "(from his bedroom) Thanks!",
        "Y’know you, really didn’t have to take me to the airport.",
        "Well, we’re really not that close. (Pause) Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.",
        "Okay. Then I guess it’s just, wait here then. (Hands her the sign that says, Wait Here.\") (To the ticket agent) Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.",
        "Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.",
        "What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?",
        "No. All right, y’know what, she’s (Points to Janice) gonna think that I’m handing you a credit card, but what I’m really gonna do is hand you a library card.",
        "(to the ticket agent) American Express?",
        "Well, I-I guess I gotta go.",
        "Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.",
        "Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.",
        "No!",
        "Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!",
        "Well, I then guess I’m going to Yemen! I’m going to Yemen! (To this old woman also going to Yemen.) When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?",
        "Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.",
        "What are you writing?",
        "Oh yeah? (He grabs the pad and starts reading it.) Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you (Pause) never go out of style—what did you throw away?",
        "Hi guys!",
        "Without me?!",
        "Yes, but in Ross’s case, they both know in two weeks that’s it.",
        "Maybe that’s because soy-burgers suck!",
        "What are you talking about?",
        "Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there? (Points to the living room.)",
        "Like what?",
        "I said, \"Like what?\"",
        "Does for me.",
        "Flashdance.",
        "She was a welder.",
        "What are the odds? What are the odds?",
        "Okay.",
        "There’s a Phoebe on my sandwich! (He walks away, giving the sandwich to Phoebe.)",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh-ho, yeah!",
        "Treeger’s snaking the shower drain.",
        "Hey!",
        "Do we pay for this?",
        "Maybe we shouldn’t pay our phone bill—free phone s*x.",
        "Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!",
        "Like finding money with naked people on it!",
        "(stopping her) Oh no-no-no-no!",
        "We don’t know what could make this go away.",
        "And no one touches the air around the TV!",
        "Oh no-no-no! (Monica mutes the TV and they tentatively look behind them)",
        "We still have p0rn.",
        "Or a job where you don’t have to carry a table.",
        "It’s the theme from Good Will Humping.",
        "Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?",
        "They don’t really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.",
        "Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?",
        "All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it’s over.",
        "What?",
        "Okay. (Pause) Good one.",
        "Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a p0rn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.",
        "Because then we would be the guys who turned off free p0rn.",
        "Pregnant Woman Slays Four?",
        "What’s the second part of your plan?",
        "You put your fist through the wall?",
        "A place where no one will ever get out alive?",
        "Are we in London?",
        "Hey.",
        "I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn’t ask me to go do it with her in the vault.",
        "What, no, \"Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?\"",
        "Y’know what, we have to turn off the p0rn.",
        "All right, ready?",
        "Two.",
        "Yeah, that’s kinda a relief.",
        "You wanna see if we still have it?",
        "FREE p0rn!!!",
        "We have free p0rn here!!!",
        "Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.",
        "All right.",
        "Wouldn’t that be Frank the III?",
        "Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?",
        "Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.",
        "Hey, y’know what, if you’re gonna do that, if you’re gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. (Phoebe doesn’t think so.) Oh, come on! Chandler’s funny, sophisticated, and he’s very loveable, once you get to know him.",
        "Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he’ll be there. And he’ll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you’re really hot.",
        "Hey!",
        "And now you’re giving me the message!",
        "You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?",
        "Hi! Hi! You’re crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.",
        "Raymond Chandler.",
        "Okay, there are no famous Joey’s. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.",
        "Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he’ll never be President. There’s never gonna be a President Joey.",
        "Wow, you’re, you’re right. I have a horrible, horrible name.",
        "Okay.",
        "No, no, you’re right, it is a ridiculous name!",
        "Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.",
        "I have no name.",
        "Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.",
        "Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?",
        "It’s Clint. It’s Clint! (He heads for his bedroom.)",
        "It’s Clint! Clint!",
        "(entering) Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?",
        "All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.",
        "Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it’s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women… So, as of 4 o’clock tomorrow, I’m either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.",
        "(pleased) Really?!",
        "Okay. Thanks.",
        "You wanna hug it out?",
        "Yay!",
        "Okay!",
        "Bye, Pheebs!",
        "Ha! Ha! Ha!",
        "Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!",
        "Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?",
        "Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please? (Gunther starts to pour him another cup.) So uh, what do you do when you’re not working here?",
        "Oh, okay, thanks. (He goes back to the couch and rejoins Monica, Joey, and Phoebe.)",
        "Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I’m exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!",
        "It’s not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!",
        "They don’t have those.",
        "Next time you snore, I’m rolling ya over!",
        "Hey, all right!",
        "Oh, she’s got you running errands, y’know, picking up wedding dresses… (Laughs and makes like Indiana Jones and his whip) Wah-pah!",
        "Y’know, whipped! Wah-pah!",
        "That’s what I did. Wah-pah!",
        "All right buddy, time to roll over. (Rolls him over, and discovers a surprise) (Looking down) No-no! (Covers his eyes) No, no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a clinic! You’re going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!",
        "It’s 6:00.",
        "Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that’s, I think that’s really cool.",
        "What?",
        "Yeah, well, I don’t dance at weddings.",
        "Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like this… (Starts to dancing really, really, really badly. Ross enters behind him and he stops.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Nothing.",
        "What?!",
        "(answering for him) Yes he did.",
        "(waking Joey) Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!",
        "You’re coming on to the entire room! (He goes over to pick up a stack of magazines next to her, and to get her attention, he throws them back down.) I’m Chandler.",
        "Hi.",
        "You mind if I…",
        "So uh, what are you in for?",
        "What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.",
        "(entering) Hello! Little ones.",
        "Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. (They’re stunned.) Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.",
        "Because I’m cooler.",
        "Well she’s, she’s the kinda girl—Joey was unconscious.",
        "Plus, you look cool.",
        "Ho! Ho! Ho!",
        "Your pants!",
        "Santa pants. (Phoebe still doesn’t get it.) Santa Claus’s pants.",
        "Uhh, a T-shirt that says, \"I don’t belong here.\"",
        "Yeah we do!",
        "Are you serious?",
        "Forget it! Okay, I’m not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!",
        "No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.",
        "(ignoring him) Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?",
        "Forget it! Okay, I’m not giving up the apartment.",
        "Oh my God!",
        "You do know that Wham broke up?",
        "Where is Emily?",
        "Man, didn’t she like just get here?",
        "Easy tiger.",
        "So what are you going to do?",
        "Are you serious?",
        "Because you’ve only known her for six weeks! Okay, I’ve got a carton of milk in my fridge I’ve had a longer relationship with!",
        "And I love the milk! But, I’m not gonna some British girl to move in with me! (Realizes that made no sense.) Joey, you say things now.",
        "Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.",
        "No thank you.",
        "Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can’t leave in the small apartment after we’ve lived here! Didn’t you ever read Flowers for Algernon?",
        "Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.",
        "Screw the Knicks!",
        "I didn’t mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.",
        "And the Knicks rule all.",
        "No. No. We’re not gonna do that, y’know why? Because its not an even trade.",
        "No!",
        "Op, op, I’m convinced!",
        "All right, but you can’t use that again for a whole year. I’m in.",
        "Okay!",
        "Fine, let’s do it.",
        "Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first",
        "That’s a low one!",
        "Why are you screaming and hugging?",
        "Yeah baby!",
        "Tickets please! (Rachel hands over the tickets) That’s courtside baby!",
        "No they didn’t!",
        "Those were like the best seats ever.",
        "Oh yeah, that’s very nice. Plus, y’know they were free and they’re too small.",
        "Oh. Oh, God! (He starts running around like a chicken with his head cut off.)",
        "I KNOW!!!",
        "Open up! Open up! Open up!",
        "What the hell is going on?!",
        "We are switching back, right now!",
        "Well, you’re gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we’re switching it back! There’s nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?",
        "What?",
        "I don’t care, this is our apartment! And they stole—you stole it—our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I’m getting back right now!",
        "Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can’t offer anything to us!",
        "Totally worth it!",
        "Good night.",
        "Okay!",
        "Oh, well, that’s great!",
        "Hey.",
        "(shocked) Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!",
        "Oh, it’s awkward. It’s awkward. It’s awkward.",
        "You can be the best man when I get married.",
        "Oh no-no-no, you—yeah, of course you get to be my best man.",
        "I’m not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!",
        "I’m not even… I’m not even…",
        "(entering) Hey guys, what are you doing?",
        "Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.",
        "Oh, I’m Ross. I’m Ross. I’m too good for the Hut; I’m too good for the Hut.",
        "See ya. (Ross exits, and Chandler moves over next to Joey, laughing.) Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.",
        "He just said, \"No strippers.\"",
        "(banging a spoon against his beer bottle) Okay, a little announcement, a little announcement. I’ve decided that my best man is, my best friend Gunther!",
        "Central Perk?",
        "(banging on the bottle again) Okay, okay, a little announcement, I just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, (to the stripper) so is the position of the bride.",
        "(opening the door) What?",
        "Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this—Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! You’re the worst best man ever!",
        "You slept with the stripper?",
        "Hey!",
        "So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? (Gives Joey a little squeeze.)",
        "So you might say, it’s a magic ring.",
        "Well, I think it all started when you said, \"Hey Joey, why don’t you be my best man.\"",
        "Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?",
        "(to Ross) You be cool. (He opens the door and lets her in as they all turn there backs on her.)",
        "Way to be cool, man.",
        "Marry me. (Both Ross and Chandler hit him.)",
        "He will, Joe.",
        "Hey, come on, it’s not your fault.",
        "No, you should.",
        "Really?",
        "Thanks man.",
        "What a baby.",
        "It could’ve been worse, he could’ve shot her.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh wow, I hope you don’t take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I’m just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.",
        "Seven times!",
        "In a foreign, romantic country…",
        "Bad London! (Takes a spoon and smacks the turkey.)",
        "Well, I don’t see that we have a choice. But, when we’re back home, we don’t do it.",
        "Y’know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs…",
        "Okay!",
        "Forget it, that’s off.",
        "The man’s got a point.",
        "Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, \"Yippee!\" just ignore me.",
        "Oh, hello Rachel.",
        "Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.",
        "Yeah, we’ll be down in like five minutes.",
        "Oh, yay…",
        "(To Monica) Hey, listen, why don’t we go change in my room?",
        "Wow, you look…",
        "Well, I’ve got a girl in here.",
        "Well, we’re-we’re hanging out in here!",
        "Well, I suppose I’d have to say you!! But, what if we’re watching a movie in here?",
        "Well, Ross and Emily aren’t gonna use it.",
        "Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects s*x. The room would be disappointed if it didn’t get s*x. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.",
        "Okay!",
        "Nope, not under here!",
        "Well, you couldn’t have looked everywhere or else you would’ve found her!",
        "Yeah, for about 30 minutes.",
        "Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. (Monica smiles at that.)",
        "Yeah, we’re gonna go.",
        "Yeah, it’s a very large plane.",
        "But, we’ll stay here with you.",
        "We have to leave for New York in an hour.",
        "We can’t do that that’s insane. I mean ‘A’ he could wake up and ‘B’ y’know, let’s go for it.",
        "Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. (Realizes something) Y’know, technically we still are over international waters.",
        "‘Kay!",
        "Uhh, no.",
        "No.",
        "Yes.",
        "Okay man. (Chandler starts to get up.)",
        "Hey!",
        "No we didn’t!",
        "Yes! Good thing we have that, ‘Not in New York’ rule.",
        "Right.",
        "Oh. Y’know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn’t because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me ‘cause, you’re really hot! Is that okay?",
        "And I’m cute too.",
        "Thank you! (They hug.) All right, I gotta go unpack.",
        "Bye.",
        "(entering) I’m still on London time, does that count?",
        "Oh, good! (They start kissing.)",
        "Y’know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.",
        "Phoebe is, making people.",
        "And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!",
        "No-no, not something stupid, something huge.",
        "Why not?! I mean it’s just, it’s just climbing! It’s just, it’s just steep!",
        "We’re going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!",
        "Yeah baby!",
        "(dejected) Yeah, well…",
        "Yeah, we could do that without y’know risking our lives at all!",
        "(dejected) Oh, well…",
        "Yeeeeahhhh.",
        "But I’ll tell you something. One of these days we’re get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!",
        "And I just want a million dollars! (EXTENDS HIS HAND HOPEFULLY)",
        "Uh-oh.",
        "She was not good. Not good.",
        "Uh-oh.",
        "(entering) Hello!",
        "(sarcastic) Noo.",
        "I didn’t know that.",
        "See, maybe that’s the one we should’ve actually hidden.",
        "This isn’t one of those uh, y’know \"If she doesn’t come, we-we don’t, we don’t come?\" Right? Because I already bought my ticket…",
        "Oh, that's Ross's.",
        "Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?",
        "[stuttering incoherently] F-hah.... flennin....",
        "I KNEW IT!!!!",
        "Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?",
        "All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there’s a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! (Reading from the book.) \"It’s almost as good as being there.\"",
        "Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.",
        "If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.",
        "Six-hour trip to London. That’s a lot of Monica.",
        "You got your passport?",
        "There it is.",
        "(entering, with Joey) All right! Let’s do it!",
        "Okay, ‘cause that’s not gonna get annoying.",
        "Hey, y’know what? I was wrong.",
        "Hey! (Trots over)",
        "Oh. (Goes and gets Phoebe’s book as Rachel comes in from her room.)",
        "(entering, with Phoebe’s book.) Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.",
        "I am, I’m ignoring you.",
        "Oh, what the hell is that?",
        "Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!",
        "Okay. Listen-listen, we’re not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?",
        "I think it’s great. It’s great. Y’know, they’re thinking of changing the name of this place.",
        "To Put the Camera Away!!!",
        "Well, I don’t have to buy that, \"I’m with stupid\" T-shirt anymore.",
        "All right, look, you’re not really gonna buy that are you? Don’t you think you’ve embarrassed me enough for one day?",
        "How can I answer that when I’m pretending I don’t know you?",
        "Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?",
        "All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y’know, you’re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.",
        "Okay, wait. All right, that’s it, okay, I’m out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore! (He trips over a box, falls into a flower stand and walks away trying to be cool.)",
        "Hey. (He nods at the hat.)",
        "No-no-no, y’know what? I really shouldn’t have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn’t cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I’ve had a really lousy day.",
        "Yeah?",
        "That’s… That’s was…",
        "How did you? How? How?",
        "I’m gonna go to the bathroom.",
        "That was pretty intense huh?",
        "(glares at him) I hope he did!",
        "Joey, it’s been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.",
        "I’d like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will. (No one in the room laughs. He starts to get flustered.) Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. (Ross looks embarrassed.) And I thought things were going to work out for him..Until the day he over inflated her. (He laughs. Jack looks at Judy and no one in the room laughs.) Ohh, Dear God.. (A cellular phone rings.)",
        "(Continuing his toast.) And I’m sure we’re all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall. (No reaction from the people.) Ohh, come on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on, you people!! All right, forget it!! Congratulations, Ross and Emily. (He sits down.)",
        "Out loud?",
        "So how are you doing?",
        "The guy was hammered, okay? There’s no way, you look like Ross’s mother.",
        "Because he’s crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.",
        "Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldn’t want you?",
        "(With the covers pulled up to his chin.) Morning, Ross.",
        "Yeah you are!!",
        "Well I’ve-I’ve never done that with you before.",
        "So, ahh, how are ya? How ya...How ya... You okay?",
        "Yes...Yes..Uh-huh, You?(Looking over at her. She looks back.) We did you.",
        "Oh yea yea, absolutely.",
        "I don’t want to look.",
        "Hey.",
        "(Very defensive.) I’m not seeing Monica.",
        "What?",
        "Oh my god!",
        "No!! Okay!! What’s with the third degree?! Why don’t you just shine a light in my eyes?! (Joey looks totally confused.)",
        "Oh yea, your right. It’s the second one.",
        "What we did last night was....",
        "Totally crazy stupid. (He nods his head at the people seated.)",
        "I’m coming over tonight though, right?",
        "Ehh, you're just liquored up.",
        "I've had a very long, hard day.",
        "Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.",
        "For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!",
        "Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.",
        "Hey Joe!",
        "Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in",
        "Hey, Pheebs!",
        "Uh, The Wheat Chief.",
        "Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story.",
        "I can't believe she can out run you man!",
        "Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.",
        "Oh that's not true.",
        "Okay, I gotta go to work.",
        "And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.",
        "Pheebs! (He goes over and kisses Phoebe, who is also stunned.) Always a pleasure. (And he struts out leaving the girls to stare at each other.)",
        "All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?",
        "I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.",
        "So, thanks for having me over! Rach. (Goes over, grabs her, and kisses her.) Pheebs. (After a moment while he decides how to kiss her around her belly, grabs her and kisses her.)",
        "Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea. (Gets up to leave.)",
        "I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.",
        "Hey, Pheebs!",
        "Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little… Y'know, it didn't have any… It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!",
        "Atlantic City!",
        "Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!",
        "I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.",
        "Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having s*x.",
        "No.",
        "Okay. (They kiss again.)",
        "That's right.",
        "Oh no.",
        "Okay.",
        "Hey! You okay?",
        "Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?",
        "All right…",
        "Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.",
        "Really? Male nurses?",
        "So they're going on dates? When?",
        "This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?",
        "All right.",
        "(spotting her) Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!",
        "Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.",
        "Fine! Maybe I will too!",
        "So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?",
        "Oh.",
        "Sure. (Pause) And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way. (Retreats in defeat.)",
        "(to another female nurse) Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?",
        "All right. Very good.",
        "Bye, momi-moo.",
        "Yes!",
        "Oh God, kindergarten flashback.",
        "Okay, keep saying it!",
        "So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?",
        "Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary… Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing s*x and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.",
        "Really? Okay, so…",
        "Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?",
        "Right!",
        "So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?",
        "That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?",
        "(entering, happily, with a bottle of champagne, thinking that Monica is the only one there) Ha-ha-ha-(sees everyone)-enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!",
        "Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!",
        "Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.",
        "Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.",
        "Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",
        "Really?! That's what you heard? (To Monica) You said that?",
        "Because I'm very happy for him! (To Monica) And you, you lucky dog!",
        "Yes!",
        "(entering) Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?",
        "If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?",
        "Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this. (He jumps up onto the table and starts doing his happy dance.)",
        "Yes!",
        "Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.",
        "That's true!",
        "That's true!",
        "Hey, there he is! There he is!",
        "How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.",
        "Expect it in 4-6 weeks. (She starts to leave.) Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.",
        "Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.",
        "Why?",
        "What's your point?",
        "(entering) Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.",
        "I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH…MY…GOD.",
        "Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to s*x!",
        "Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. (She starts to take off her latex gloves.) Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.",
        "Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.",
        "All right, let's show them how it's done.",
        "Y'know that wasn't part of it?",
        "Nope.",
        "(quietly) Hi! (They both start kissing.)",
        "Uhh, 9. (He pushes the clock into the sink.)",
        "I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.",
        "Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.",
        "Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go. (He starts for his bedroom.)",
        "I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.",
        "What's going on?",
        "Uh, hey!",
        "We're flipping Monica's mattress.",
        "Aww, man! (They go into Monica's room.)",
        "Oh yes, somebody just said, \"Can you hear anything?\"",
        "Condoms?",
        "And condoms are the way to do that?",
        "(jumping on the bed) I can't believe it! We're here!",
        "Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.",
        "Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!",
        "(looks at what she's holding and shies away) Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!",
        "Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed! (He grabs their bags and sprints out.)",
        "Okay, great. (He grabs the remote and turns on the TV to the chase.)",
        "Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!",
        "What? Why?",
        "Uh-huh. (He doesn't take his eyes off the TV.)",
        "(turning to face her) Yeah.",
        "I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch-(realizes)-have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.",
        "(watching TV, in fact, ER is on.) Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!",
        "Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?",
        "Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?",
        "Do not speak ill of the dead.",
        "I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.",
        "I said, \"Geez, relax Monnnnn.\"",
        "Damn Rollos!",
        "Hey.",
        "It was terrible. I fought with (Pause) my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this? (Throws away another Rollo)",
        "Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.",
        "Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.",
        "Monica. (Follows her out.)",
        "Okay, fine, $300.",
        "Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!",
        "Hi!",
        "Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.",
        "Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Yes that was mine.",
        "Yes that would have made more sense.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "I just came over to drop off…nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?",
        "So, I guess this is over.",
        "Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.",
        "Because of the weekend, we had a fight.",
        "So, this isn't over?",
        "Really? Okay. Great!",
        "(stops her) We're in a relationship?",
        "Okay.",
        "Joey, can I talk to you for a second? (He grabs him and starts to drag Joey into Monica's room.)",
        "Yes. Yes. (Lets him up.)",
        "It happened in London.",
        "The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.",
        "No-no-no-no-no! You can't!",
        "Fun's over!",
        "Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?",
        "Sorry.",
        "Hello!",
        "Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. (Phoebe stares at him wide-eyed. Chandler sees her reaction.) That didn't happen, I made that up!",
        "Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?",
        "Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence…",
        "You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.",
        "So you're really okay with this?",
        "Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.",
        "Okay, what is in here? Rocks?",
        "So, rocks.",
        "Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.",
        "Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.",
        "Well, I think it's very brave what you said.",
        "Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?",
        "Uh, Ross?",
        "Yeah, we are so sorry.",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh yeah, there-there she is!",
        "That's sweet, Joey.",
        "Are you aware that you're still talking?",
        "No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.",
        "It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.",
        "Really? Worse than, \"More turkey Mr. Chandler?\"",
        "It's exactly like it sounds.",
        "Arghhhhhh!! (Joey turns around to taunt him, but Chandler is in the doorway and Joey is facing the kitchen.)",
        "I'm over here big guy.",
        "(laughing) You did look like an idiot.",
        "Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.",
        "(seeing her) Okay.",
        "Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.",
        "Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.",
        "Emotional Knapsack?",
        "Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don’t take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.",
        "Dude, don't do that too me!",
        "No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.",
        "I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!",
        "I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!",
        "I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.",
        "We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!",
        "Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look. (They both quickly push their sleeves over their elbows.)",
        "Oh my God!",
        "You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!",
        "Sorry!",
        "Sorry.",
        "Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.",
        "Okay.",
        "Are you all right?",
        "What?",
        "Without my toe?! I need my toe!",
        "That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!",
        "That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!",
        "Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail. (He storms out.)",
        "I can't believe this.",
        "Yeah, well, sorry doesn’t bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.",
        "Yeah, just leave me alone for a while. (He goes into his apartment.)",
        "Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, \"Quack, quack!\" I’m happy all the time!",
        "Nice try.",
        "Look, Monica…",
        "This is not going to work.",
        "You are so great! I love you!",
        "Nothing! I said, I said \"You're so great\" and then I just, I just stopped talking!",
        "No I didn't!",
        "No I didn't!",
        "No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!",
        "Are you looking at naked tribe's women?",
        "That's a pig.",
        "Hey! (Joey quickly hides the magazine under the couch.)",
        "What?!",
        "How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?",
        "Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!",
        "He thought you said gonad.",
        "Love what you've done with the place.",
        "Oh yeah!",
        "Oh, the tears are real.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "You built a fort didn't ya?",
        "(notices something) Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was (makes a humming noise.)",
        "I hate this thing!",
        "(entering) Hello children!",
        "Okay. (Starts to head for where the foosball table usually is.)",
        "Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?",
        "You mean this. (Does the maneuver perfectly.)",
        "(gasps) All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!",
        "Okay.",
        "No-no-no-no!",
        "Okay, so he's out of here.",
        "Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?",
        "Not even on page 7?",
        "What about that circled one?",
        "Yes, it is.",
        "There we go!",
        "Let's go quicker.",
        "Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.",
        "Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.",
        "It's a kitchen slash bathroom.",
        "We are bad people.",
        "Yes that was a nice place!",
        "Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!",
        "What are we gonna do?",
        "About Ross!",
        "(grabbing the phone) Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. (Listens.) Well, who doesn't love dogs? (Thinks.) Ah, he's a tap dancer! (Listens.) Yes, some would say that is a lost art. (Thinks.) He's a pimp! (Listens.) There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! (Pause.) Hello?",
        "Ohhhhh!",
        "98. 99. 100. Okay, go!",
        "Here we go! Here we go!",
        "Hey!",
        "You're kidding, no!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yes! Ross, you have to stay!",
        "All right, buddy!",
        "Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?",
        "All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a bonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?",
        "Top of the world? Dock of the bay? (He tries to think of another but can't) I'm out.",
        "Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!",
        "See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!",
        "Yeah!",
        "(interrupting him) All this lying has been hard on us too.",
        "Well, yeah actually.",
        "I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.",
        "Help!",
        "Hi, Pheebs!",
        "I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.",
        "Well, what did the police say?",
        "Ross, it's just a sandwich!",
        "(reading) Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?",
        "Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?",
        "What is going on here?",
        "Yeah.",
        "No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your (Thinks) adult film class.",
        "Oh—I don't know.",
        "Hey.",
        "(gasps) You're naked in this picture!",
        "Ross?",
        "Which I may say, right now, is out of control.",
        "And you're okay with that?",
        "(Sees the picture) Oh no! No! No! No! (Monica gasps as well.)",
        "All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.",
        "Joey's a s*x addict.",
        "Well let's….let's see what everybody thinks of that?",
        "Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a s*x addict?",
        "(Answering the phone at work) Hello, Chandler Bing.",
        "(Angrily) Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! (Ross and Joey laugh silently.) It’s been six months! It’s not funny!",
        "Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!! (Joey hangs up.)",
        "The British are coming?",
        "Ohh.",
        "Why?",
        "Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.",
        "Okay, I'll stop.",
        "You wanna play?",
        "Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.",
        "I'm intrigued.",
        "Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.",
        "Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?",
        "(entering from his room carrying a fire extinguisher and wearing oven mitts) Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid—Op! Op! (He puts out a small fire which has re-ignited in his room.)",
        "(entering from his bedroom) Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!",
        "Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?",
        "(To Ross) Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.",
        "The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.",
        "Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?",
        "I paid for those tickets!",
        "Oh yeah! (Makes an unintelligible taunting sound.)",
        "When did that happen to you?!",
        "Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.",
        "Okay, bye! (To the gang.) Oh my God!!",
        "I don't believe they're brother and sister.",
        "Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?",
        "Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! (Pause) Last night!",
        "Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!",
        "All right. (Takes a copy.)",
        "What is up?",
        "No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.",
        "Could I be more sorry. (Looks at Joey.)",
        "(To Ross) I'm sorry too.",
        "I am sorry, Ross.",
        "This took you all day?!",
        "Sorry man.",
        "Did they teach you that in your anger management class?",
        "Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.",
        "I know, I can do this. (He takes her hand.)",
        "I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, (Points to Monica) this is Monica. (Points to his boss.) This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.",
        "No, sir.",
        "What?",
        "Oh, that was my work laugh.",
        "Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.",
        "Okay.",
        "Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!",
        "And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. (She glares at him.) Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.",
        "Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at…bigger rocks. (He starts to leave and stops an entering Rachel.) Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?",
        "Okay, good luck with that. (Exits.)",
        "Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.",
        "Let them win one.",
        "You're not even giving them a chance!",
        "Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? (Does his work laugh.) (To Monica) Please let them win!",
        "Oopsey, missed it!",
        "Long! (Gives Monica the Work Laugh.)",
        "Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it. (Removes a smashed racquet from his bag.)",
        "It was my racquet.",
        "If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.",
        "Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.",
        "Just a little bit of sugar.",
        "Oh, you get used to it.",
        "So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?",
        "Oh. (Does a double take when he realizes what she just said.)",
        "What?",
        "Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.",
        "Well, I just…",
        "Really?",
        "I think I do! (They all laugh.) Thank you, Monica.",
        "Coffee in a fight! (Does the laugh again.)",
        "(from his bedroom) All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!",
        "But we're not ready to tell yet!",
        "Man, she is really gullible.",
        "Okay.",
        "Why would I be mad?",
        "(realizes what Ross just said and the implications to him) I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.",
        "I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!",
        "And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty (counts his money) seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down—let's write it down!",
        "Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!",
        "It's your timer.",
        "All right, then massage me up right nice!",
        "Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!",
        "It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!",
        "Good-bye muscles!!",
        "I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just—I didn't know what it was!",
        "Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.",
        "(examining the hat) And the bunny got away. (Turns and starts looking for the bunny as Joey puts the hat on.)",
        "And you're gonna make them all disappear.",
        "Done.",
        "Hey.",
        "Hey!",
        "Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!",
        "Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.",
        "Oh my God!",
        "And a date with a man!",
        "(wincing) Yes, he is!",
        "I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!",
        "Hey, is Rachel here?",
        "(coming all the way in) Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.",
        "(falling into that trap) I don't like your massages.",
        "Okay, but now see you're crying!",
        "What?",
        "It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.",
        "Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.",
        "Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, \"Who's the best of that?\" They'd have to go to you.",
        "Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!",
        "Absolutely!",
        "Yeah! (They hug.)",
        "Hey man, how did the audition go?",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Oh, hey! (Ross nods in agreement as well.)",
        "Yeah umm, they're called wallets.",
        "(deadpan, standing next to Monica) We're very happy for you.",
        "We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know…",
        "(To Monica) Happy New Year!",
        "Do you want us to leave the room, or?",
        "That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.",
        "I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the \"new thing you do that day!\" (Ross looks at him.) And it starts right now!",
        "Nice!",
        "(reading it) Elizabeth Hornswoggle?",
        "Horn-swoggle.",
        "No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before. (Sits down rubbing his temple.)",
        "What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.",
        "(notices something) Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? (Pause, no one speaks.) Someone comment on the pants!",
        "That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. (Motions to Ross's buttock.) Maybe there's something in that area.",
        "Oh come on!! (Storms out.)",
        "(on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. (Smells it.) Yep.",
        "(entering) Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! (Hands him the 50 bucks he's about to owe him.) Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?! (He sits down and sighs in relief.)",
        "And we're done with the chicken fried rice.",
        "Or we can do the actual telephone thing.",
        "(entering) Hello children!",
        "Hey.",
        "Really?",
        "Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. (Phoebe giggles uncontrollably.) Are you okay?",
        "Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.",
        "What's going on?",
        "Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.",
        "Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.",
        "The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.",
        "I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.",
        "Ow!",
        "Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.",
        "No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!",
        "Well it's not flexed right now!",
        "Sure, I'll do it with ya.",
        "That new mountain bike?",
        "Your work makes me sad.",
        "(after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!",
        "Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?",
        "Are you serious?",
        "(a little hurt) Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps—She knows!",
        "(entering) Joey!",
        "Phoebe knows about us!",
        "Oh man!",
        "Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!",
        "Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day. (He's holding the phone so that Monica can hear it as well.)",
        "Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.",
        "Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.",
        "Oh yeah, they're totally gonna back down!",
        "(initially worried, but gets over it) Really?",
        "Yes.",
        "Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?",
        "How do you know?!",
        "At this?!",
        "Phoebe.",
        "Come on in.",
        "Sure.",
        "Me? No. You?",
        "So do I.",
        "I'm gonna put on some music.",
        "You look good.",
        "Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?",
        "Oh, do you not want to?",
        "(swallowing hard) Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.",
        "Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!",
        "Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little mimic of her dance.)",
        "Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?",
        "Oh, you're-you're going?",
        "(swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the s*x.",
        "Not if I kiss you first.",
        "Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.",
        "Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have s*x with ya!",
        "Because I'm in love with Monica!!",
        "Love her! That's right, I…LOVE…HER!!! I love her!! (They walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica.",
        "And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. (Pause) And might I say your breasts are still showing.",
        "Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.",
        "(To Monica) Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window.)",
        "Oh, I'm going on the lamb.",
        "Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.",
        "Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.",
        "(interrupting) Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!",
        "Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.",
        "Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.",
        "(To Rachel) Sounds like a fun party.",
        "Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.",
        "Wh-wh-why?!",
        "Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!",
        "I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I’m right. I'm right. Am I right?",
        "Okay. It's not different at all, is it?",
        "Hmm.",
        "Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever. (Gets up.)",
        "Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.",
        "I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.",
        "What?!",
        "Well, you do want all that stuff, right?",
        "Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!",
        "Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!",
        "Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!",
        "Well, I did not know that.",
        "It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.",
        "By me?",
        "Monica. (Goes to talk to her.)",
        "Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.",
        "Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.",
        "Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?",
        "I need to talk to you, it's urgent!",
        "Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this. (He slowly and awkwardly gets down on one knee.)",
        "(getting out a ring box) Monica…",
        "Will you marry me?",
        "I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.",
        "I'm doing this because I'm sorry?",
        "No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. (Laughs.) Will you be my wife?",
        "Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.",
        "Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys. (Turns to look at Ross and Joey.)",
        "I didn't think I was!",
        "Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door. (Points at the door.)",
        "Okay, how long is this going to go on.",
        "That's not funny.",
        "Okay. (He picks the 9 of Spades)",
        "Oh yes.",
        "(pause) Yes.",
        "Hi there!",
        "That.",
        "Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?",
        "Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.",
        "Dude! That's my girlfriend!",
        "Weirder than watching his two moms make out? (Monica nods in agreement.)",
        "Yeah, it is the best.",
        "Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.",
        "Yeah, I wanna go to babe.",
        "Hi!",
        "Ah sure. What's in 'em?",
        "Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.",
        "Y'know I rued the day once…didn't get a whole lot else done.",
        "(shocked) Well I mean, let me get the door first. (Goes and opens the door.) Oh, hi! No one. (Exits.)",
        "Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!",
        "Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!",
        "I wish I had smoked for my career…",
        "Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!",
        "I think you smell great! (He sniffs her shoulder.)",
        "Great job with the cups, Pheebs!",
        "Awesome!",
        "There are snow cones! (Monica glares at him.) Snow cones! Yuck!",
        "Thank you! Thank you! (Runs to the snow cone machine.)",
        "(to Kim and Nancy) Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was supposed to meet her for lunch.",
        "Okay, great.",
        "I'll catch you guys later. (Exits.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?",
        "Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. (To Monica) Hey, how about maroon?",
        "Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. (No one laughs.) Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.",
        "Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.",
        "Hi, Joe.",
        "Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!",
        "Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? (Imitating what his famous speech would sound like.) I kinda have a dream! I don’t want to talk about it.",
        "You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! (To Monica) I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. (Seeing Monica's stare.) (To Joey) Anyway we're talking about your dream. (To Monica) I love you. (To Joey) Your dream? (Leans in to listen closely.)",
        "No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.",
        "Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?",
        "Well there you have it!",
        "Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?",
        "Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so…",
        "(looking at the sketch) Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.",
        "Okay.",
        "Yeah.",
        "(straining) Okay.",
        "Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!",
        "Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!",
        "Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.",
        "Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?",
        "(stopping him) Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?",
        "Ooh, I do! I do! I do!",
        "(To Rachel) He has a gun!",
        "(entering) Hey Monica, here's your broom back.",
        "Oh hey, how'd the interview go?",
        "So what happened?",
        "Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.",
        "Come on, Rach.",
        "I gotta check out this hot girl! (He heads to the window but realizes something, stops, turns and points at Monica.) There she is! (He dances over to her and kisses her.)",
        "(To Gary) So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?",
        "Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you… (He gestures and spills some of his coffee.)",
        "Uh, yeah.",
        "Why?",
        "Ohh, so?",
        "Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have s*x over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.",
        "That was amazing!",
        "That was amazing.",
        "No, you're the best.",
        "No, you're the best.",
        "Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.",
        "Oh yeah, it's so cool. (He opens his coat and has it pinned to the lining.) Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. (Pause, softly) That's pee-pee. (Heads for the bathroom.)",
        "Monica! This is the Men's room! (Pause) Isn't it?",
        "No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!",
        "Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!",
        "(gasps) So?",
        "Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?",
        "Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.",
        "Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting. (Kisses her.)",
        "Yeah?",
        "Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.",
        "Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!",
        "Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! (Does a dance of joy.) (Monica glares at him.) And now we're back.",
        "(entering) You guys ready fore the movies?",
        "Hey!",
        "Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.",
        "Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.",
        "Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.",
        "Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.",
        "Oh, okay. (Hands her the money.) Here you go.",
        "Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.",
        "Okay, bye!",
        "What?",
        "I was not flirting.",
        "Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.",
        "You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting. (Starts to move towards Ross.)",
        "I was not flirting.",
        "I was not and oh God, shh!",
        "Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?",
        "So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!",
        "I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. (She just stares at him.) I've done it again.",
        "Happy Anniversary, 10 months! (They kiss.)",
        "Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there. (Points)",
        "The one that doesn't.",
        "Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?",
        "Okay.",
        "If you said, \"Big lima bean, bubbling up.\" Would she understand the difference?",
        "Here you go. (Hands her the money.) Now stop bringing us pizzas you.",
        "You're welcome.",
        "What?",
        "Thank you for that! (To Monica) I was not flirting.",
        "Really?!",
        "(starts to laugh, but then gets serious) So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?",
        "Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.",
        "Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?",
        "(smiling) Well, what is it?",
        "(smiling) If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?",
        "Doesn't know, \"Hello.\" But she knows Capricorn One.",
        "So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?",
        "See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!",
        "Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.",
        "Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, \"I'm just flirting, no big deal.\" But the guy is thinking, \"Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!\"",
        "It's true.",
        "Again true.",
        "All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.",
        "Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! (Tries to pantomime it for her.) Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. (Pause.) So, you're old and small.",
        "Okay, hold on. (Pauses as he readies himself.) Okay. (Walks away.)",
        "(To Monica) If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.",
        "Oh the humanity.",
        "More so than anything else.",
        "Almost over man.",
        "Why am I looking?",
        "You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.",
        "(singing) Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing countdown…engines…on!",
        "(To Monica) Hey!",
        "You ready?",
        "You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.",
        "Let me see the earrings.",
        "(looking at them) They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?",
        "(To Ross) Thanks for picking out the earrings man.",
        "Hey man, what's up?",
        "Yeah, yeah! Me too!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, I like danger.",
        "Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.",
        "It is starting to get dark out there.",
        "(laughing) Okay. (Deadpan) But it is officially nighttime.",
        "Your tax dollars?",
        "(leans in and takes a sniff of Joey's sandwich) Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.",
        "I can't smell your sandwich?",
        "Okay, I'll give them back. (Exhales strongly through his nose and Joey just glares at him.) Look! What is so great about that sandwich?",
        "Okay.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?",
        "How do you figure that?",
        "Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.",
        "Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.",
        "Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!",
        "(deadpan) Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.",
        "What's going on?",
        "Uh, HELLO!!",
        "(pouting) It was a car backfire!",
        "Who jumps at loud noises!",
        "Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. (He gets up and starts for the door.)",
        "(returning) Oh my God! (Storms out.)",
        "Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever…",
        "No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.",
        "You dove in front of Ross! Ross!",
        "I do not hate Ross!",
        "What picture?",
        "Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!",
        "When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.",
        "From a bullet!",
        "Much sense?!",
        "So you risked your life, for a sandwich!",
        "So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.",
        "Really?!",
        "Thanks. (He grabs the sandwich.)",
        "(with his mouthful) Oh-oi-ho, yeah!",
        "Hm-hmm. (Goes to take another bite.)",
        "I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.",
        "Before or after you were shot by your own troops?",
        "Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.",
        "Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!",
        "Okay, so Richard, Richard!",
        "What?",
        "How much did I love The King and I? (Oh, you get the point by now.)",
        "You okay there man?",
        "Wow umm, calm down.",
        "Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?",
        "You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!",
        "Yeah, I know that means buddy!",
        "Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.",
        "Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?",
        "All right, great, road trip baby! (To Monica) This okay with you?",
        "Thank you.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough? (Holds up 3 of them in different colors.)",
        "What?",
        "Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?",
        "I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?",
        "So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?",
        "All right, bye-bye now!",
        "Okay!",
        "We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Isn't that Ross's money?",
        "I don't know.",
        "Okay!",
        "Too dry.",
        "No!",
        "No!",
        "Yes.",
        "I also said, \"Yes!\"",
        "No! (Realizes) Ahhh!!!",
        "Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.",
        "They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!",
        "Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.",
        "Oh, you don't want me on the trip?",
        "All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.",
        "All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!",
        "You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.",
        "All right!! (Gets out and Joey speeds away.) Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!",
        "I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.",
        "Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.",
        "Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road. (Looks into the bag.) Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?",
        "(who has just entered) Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!",
        "Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?",
        "That's a good idea. I wonder where I could (Pause) get a basket of p0rn…",
        "Really?",
        "Okay! (Stands up) This is it! (Claps his hands) We're gonna get married!",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!",
        "Hey!",
        "Yes! Well that-yes.",
        "We actually missed it.",
        "What?!",
        "Hi!",
        "So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?",
        "It’s a buffet man.",
        "Listen, I gotta talk to you.",
        "Monica and I almost got married last night.",
        "Look, I just don’t think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y’know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y’know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?",
        "What?!",
        "(returning with Joey) Hi.",
        "Hey!",
        "Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or…",
        "(not quite sure) You did.",
        "Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one’s free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one’s free.",
        "I don’t know. But I-I-I know I love you!",
        "So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.",
        "Yes, we don’t get married unless there’s a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight (motions to the craps table) then there’s a definite sign that we should get married.",
        "Sounds great.",
        "Ready!",
        "(deadpan) Yes, yes eight.",
        "That was so unlikely. Well, let’s get married! I guess.",
        "That’s right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!",
        "Yeah. (They go pack.) We’re doing the right thing, right?",
        "Well you did pull his hair.",
        "I’m not getting into this again!",
        " Well, I told you not to walk. Here. (Picks her up.) There. Okay. (He opens the door, carries her across the threshold, stops, backs out, and lets go of Monica who is only holding on by his neck.)",
        "No!",
        "All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y’know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.",
        "Me too!",
        "No!",
        "Jeez, relax! It’s not like we’re mar-ah-ah!! (Runs out.)",
        "(entering, slowly) Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?",
        "Well, what if all my stuff was here?",
        "Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying?",
        "Me asking is kind of a sign.",
        "Okay!!!!!",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh thanks.",
        "The door hasn’t been locked in five years, but okay! (Runs out.) Ready?!",
        "Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can’t get in!",
        "This is not a sign!",
        "It’s an old key!",
        "I love you!",
        "Are you hugging the door right now.",
        "Yeah-yeah, me neither.",
        "The key’s stuck in the lock.",
        "(trying the handle) It still doesn’t work.",
        "Oh.",
        "Nice job Joe! You’re quite the craftsmen.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "(To Phoebe) Is that Joey?! (She nods yes) Let me talk to him!",
        "(To Phoebe) Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.",
        "(To Joey) Hey!",
        "No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!",
        "Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!",
        "Uh, what was that?",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.",
        "Huh.",
        "Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!",
        "Okay.",
        "Wow!",
        "Do we have to?",
        "Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.",
        "Yeah, I think we should see other people.",
        "Yes.",
        "It's a great idea. (They kiss)",
        "Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our (His and Monica's) anniversary.",
        "(coughing) Art lover!",
        "I said art lover.",
        "I don't know, I'm very tired.",
        "So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.",
        "Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.",
        "(To Monica) Happy plane-aversary.",
        "Can I give you a present now?",
        "Okay! (He grabs his carryon and starts rummaging through it.) Oh man! Don’t tell me I did this!",
        "How do you feel about the, \"I really did forgot the present, please forgive me\" not fake out?",
        "Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!",
        "What-what Richard thing?",
        "What Richard thing?",
        "(talking out of the side of his mouth) I'm not mad.",
        "Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal. (He still ain't happy.)",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Love your condoms my man.",
        "Why?! What happened?!",
        "No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.",
        "No! Her boyfriend Richard!",
        "When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!",
        "Thanks. (They hug.)",
        "(pushing her away from another hug) Next time?",
        "There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!",
        "That's so funny, because I think I just did!",
        "Fine with me!",
        "What are you talking…",
        "Really?",
        "(interrupting in the nick of time) Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.",
        "Whoa!",
        "Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick! (Mimics it.)",
        "Good luck!",
        "I see.",
        "(totally confused) What?",
        "What's an identical hand twin?",
        "Are you sure you weren't (pause) looking at your hands in a mirror?",
        "(totally confused) How?",
        "Again I must go back to, how?",
        "(Pause) Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.",
        "No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!",
        "No!",
        "That was Joey!",
        "Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.",
        "Really?",
        "Okay. (He gets up and goes to find her.)",
        "(walking by with his luggage) See you later Mon.",
        "What does it look like? I'm going home.",
        "Come on! I was there! (He's propped up with his hand on a statute of a naked guy. He winces and pulls his hand away.) I know he's the love of your life.",
        "Really?!",
        "Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.",
        "(arm-in-arm with Monica) Hey Pheebs!",
        "Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love. (They start kissing.)",
        "Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!",
        "Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?",
        "8. 8!",
        "If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!",
        "Noo!",
        "Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.",
        "Two fours.",
        "Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get the biggest suite in the place! (Everyone cheers) Wait-wait-wait-wait! We (motions to Monica and him.) get the biggest suite in the place.",
        "(sees the roll) Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!",
        "Another hard 8.",
        "Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; (pause) and we get married here tonight.",
        "You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.",
        "Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.",
        "Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?",
        "Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!",
        "(spots one) Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?",
        "All right!",
        "Here it is! Here it is!",
        "It's a four.",
        "Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! (Picks up a blue sweater.) Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.",
        "Let's go! (Starts to leave.)",
        "Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.",
        "I don't think so.",
        "(looks around) Here just…take this. (Hands her the sweater.)",
        "No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.",
        "Okay, one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)",
        "Hello! One marriage please!",
        "(singing) Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!",
        "Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?",
        "Okay! (Stands up) This is it! (Claps his hands) We're gonna get married!",
        "(To Monica) Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?",
        "Okay.",
        "Hiya doin' pumpkin?",
        "(terrified) Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!",
        "Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go! (Breathes a sigh of relief)",
        "So, what are you gonna do?",
        "Me?! Why me?",
        "I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.",
        "(To Phoebe, behind Monica's back) Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem. (When Monica turns back he smiles and kisses her, when she turns away he nods that he'll do it to Phoebe.)",
        "Hey ladies! What are you in here for? (Laughs at his joke.)",
        "Gary, I'm here to report a crime.",
        "It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.",
        "Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.",
        "Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!",
        "You mean scared.",
        "Scared? Happy?",
        "I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!",
        "Were you're parents happy, or something?",
        "Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.",
        "Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!",
        "(pause) Yeah, you're right about that.",
        "Hi!",
        "Yes I did, and I think you should do it.",
        "He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.",
        "I’m sorry. (Pause) If you ask me, I'd move in with him.",
        "Hey Gar!",
        "Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?",
        "All right, let me in. (He jumps off of the counter to join in the game.)",
        "What?",
        "I'm not a dropper!",
        "It's throwing and catching!",
        "Oh! Oh! That's so hard. (Starts to juggle the ball, but loses control and almost drops it and hands it to Monica.)",
        "Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.",
        "Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.",
        "Not fun anymore?",
        "Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!",
        "Oh that is over!",
        "You guys wanna eat here?",
        "Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper. (We see various scenes of him dropping a football, a mug of coffee, the phone, an apple, a Frisbee, a record, and the final scene has a ball bouncing off of his chest. I'm not going to describe them, you'll have to see them.)",
        "Y’know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?",
        "No. When it comes to sweets, he’s surprisingly strict.",
        "No, no, I keep trying, y’know? I can get out, \"Joey, I have too…\" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, \"…go to the bathroom.\" He may think I’m sick.",
        "Oh, so that’s this is gonna work now? You’re just gonna order me around all the time?",
        "All right.",
        "No-o-o! (To Monica) No? (She nods no.) No-o-o! Look Joey, here’s the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I’m gonna be moving out man.",
        "Look, I-I’m just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I’m moving right back in with you!",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "(looking down) What gave me away?",
        "Okay, so that’s it, everybody knows! It’s official, we’re moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?",
        "Wow that was my scariest voice! You’re very brave.",
        "Hey.",
        "Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. (Awkward silence ensues.) Seriously.",
        "Well, I-I still think you’re very-very nice and very pretty…",
        "(To Monica) All yours babe. (Walks away.)",
        "Rach…",
        "Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?",
        "Well, Joey’s my best friend.",
        "You just said… Of course you’re my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?",
        "Okay. (She grabs a tin of freshly baked cookies) Oh yes. (He reaches for one.)",
        "Hey-hey!",
        "I am now!",
        "Okay, bye! (Exits.)",
        "Look, I’m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.",
        "Not once did we do that.",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh yeah? Well, how’d she take it?",
        "And you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friend cry?",
        "Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!",
        "What?",
        "Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?",
        "Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you’re not married to anymore of us are ya?",
        "You left a shoe here?!",
        "Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I’ll be sure to give him your shoe.",
        "(not enthused) Yeah, all right.",
        "Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?",
        "Yeah, I’m gonna pass. ‘Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.",
        "Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. (Tries to get her to drink a little more from the bottle when he suddenly smells something. It’s times like these I’m glad Smell-O-Vision hasn’t been invented.) Do you know what Pheebs? When you’re done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too. (Phoebe is changing hers.)",
        "See that’s where I think that you’re wrong. We’ve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.",
        "I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y’know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around… (He degrades into baby talk, but he means when they grab his finger.)",
        "Okay, I’m a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.",
        "Hey!",
        "Shocking! Since you still have the keys.",
        "What equity investments?",
        "You don’t even have a car!",
        "And?",
        "There you are.",
        "(entering) Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog! (He holds up this Xena-like warrior action figure.)",
        "He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!",
        "They’re not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!",
        "Glass, sand, whatever. (Walks out as Monica and Phoebe turn to check on the babies again.)",
        "(entering) All right. (Clears throat) I thought about it and maybe you’re right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.",
        "I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.",
        "Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y’know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it’s lodged in my throat. (Mimics a cat trying to cough up a hairball.) (He does it again.)",
        "But you found the keys to his clothes?",
        "That is true.",
        "Ahh, I think it just moved. It’s really poking me.",
        "I think that’s gum.",
        "Okay, listen this really hurts. Let’s go.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Well, let’s just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.",
        "And protected them from a tornado?",
        "Was the setting of Phoebe’s triumph.",
        "Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.",
        "(pause) Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Pheebs, I don’t understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?",
        "Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday’s was just our thing man!",
        "Who was it?",
        "Sure!",
        "Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y’know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!",
        "Okay so you mean no as in, \"Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let’s discuss it before we reject it completely.\"",
        "So, that’s it?",
        "Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It’s the oldest game!",
        "I don’t have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!",
        "No, I’m not mocking you, (in a mocking voice) or you beautiful guest room. (Exits.)",
        "Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.",
        "(reading the ad) \"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly.\" Nice!",
        "Hi.",
        "Hi, listen, I’m sorry about before. I don’t need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn’t get girls, and now I can ‘em—Now, I have you. (Monica glares at him.) Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women…",
        "Really?",
        "Ohh.",
        "That’s a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.",
        "We don’t have to come up with this now.",
        "Hey, y’know what? Why don’t we think about changes we can make in the living room?",
        "Yeah, I mean we’re gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair. (Kisses her and heads into the living room.)",
        "Is that a problem?",
        "Oh, that’s cool. Then I’ll just bring them both over.",
        "Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I’ll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!",
        "In the game room!",
        "All right! That’s fine! That’s fine! I won’t bring over the chairs! I won’t bring anything over! I wouldn’t want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma’s place!! (Storms out.)",
        "(entering) You can call off the roommate search! (To the potential roommate) Hi! I’ll be living here. (Heads for the bathroom.)",
        "Why did you take the shower curtain down?",
        "Well, why don’t you tell her to stop being silly! (Monica mocks him and he joins in.)",
        "Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.",
        "That’s laughter.",
        "I don’t know.",
        "Yeah, I do.",
        "He’s being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!",
        "Yeah that’s not worried. {Transcriber’s note: I think that’s what he says, if anyone thinks any different let me know. ‘Cause that sentence doesn’t make sense to me, but I played it 20 times and that’s what I came up with.}",
        "Of course!",
        "Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.",
        "Okay!",
        "Oh my God! Someone’s killed Square Man!",
        "Oh that’s so sweet! I want to show you something too!",
        "Y’know those big-big uh, road signs that say \"Merge?\"",
        "Y’know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that’s you and I together! Merge!",
        "Really?!",
        "(watches Joey for a moment) Okay! (Joey quickly moves the hockey stick so that he’s scratching his back with it.) Listen, I’m gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.",
        "First of the month.",
        "No, just the months you actually want to live here.",
        "Okay, here is the phone bill. (Hands it to Joey.)",
        "That’s our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don’t I just—why don’t I just cover you for a while?",
        "It’s not charity, Joe…",
        "Okay uh, here’s the electric bill. (Hands it to him.)",
        "Uh, yeah.",
        "So, we’ll do the rest of the bills later then?",
        "No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn’t take it.",
        "I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y’know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won’t hurt his pride.",
        "Well that would help the pride thing.",
        "Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?",
        "Okay! (They kiss) So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?",
        "Hey!",
        "Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we’d do nothing.",
        "Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.",
        "Yes, but for the last time.",
        "He’s at a dinner party.",
        "Oh, I wish I’d know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.",
        "Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?",
        "Yes it would. What do you say to $50?",
        "Okay, let’s play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.",
        "Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.",
        "Oh yes!",
        "Okay.",
        "No! No! No! No—(Joey looks at him)—one can beat me.",
        "See? Now, that’s why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.",
        "Still broken?",
        "Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack? (Holds up a deck of cards.)",
        "Okay, uh, how about, how about—y’know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it’s fun.",
        "Cups.",
        "I’ll teach ya! Come on, come on, it’s really easy and really, really fun.",
        "Okay, here you go. (He deals out two cards each.) I have two queens, what do you have?",
        "Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!",
        "Oh yeah! Okay, let’s play again. (He deals out two cards each again.) What do you got?",
        "You’re kidding right?",
        "Well that’s a full cup! (Pays him again.)",
        "You win.",
        "It doesn’t matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?",
        "Not 700 exactly?",
        "Double it! (He does.)",
        "Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.",
        "Hey, I didn’t make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. (Joey gets excited.) Don’t get to excited because that’s not gonna happen unless you get—No way! (He takes the top card, which is the two of clubs. Of course, any card would’ve won. Chandler pays him.)",
        "What’s wrong?",
        "Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!",
        "Oh man!!",
        "All right, let’s play one more hand! One more!",
        "I can’t take the big white dog! You love it!",
        "No, but wait—what if I bought it from you, y’know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say (Gets choked up) $1,500?",
        "When did I try to give you money?",
        "I’m just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you’re okay.",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "I know. (He kisses her.)",
        "No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)",
        "Sure!",
        "I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.",
        "Exactly.",
        "It’s not a real game! I made it up!",
        "At a fake game!!",
        "Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.",
        "Hmm, let’s see if it comes up this time. (He looks at his cards and shrugs.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, what’s the matter?",
        "Yeah?",
        "What?!",
        "Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you’re gonna go?",
        "Oh hi!",
        "Why don’t you open with a joke?",
        "Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not talking about Chuckles University?!",
        "That’s the way I did it ‘til I was 19.",
        "Hey.",
        "Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor’s Guild.",
        "(opens and reads it) \"Benefits lapsed.\"",
        "Okay, it’s not a check. They’re saying your health insurance expired because, you didn’t work enough last year.",
        "All right.",
        "I’m sorry man, there’s never a good time to (pauses) stop catching on fire.",
        "Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.",
        "Hey!",
        "That’s great, but shouldn’t you be on the toilet right now?",
        "What’s wrong with you?",
        "This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you go to the doctor!",
        "That’s a hernia.",
        "Hey, will you grab me a cruller? (Joey starts to groan and get up.) Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!",
        "I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let’s just get that thing…pushed back in.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh Joey’s got a really bad hernia, but that’s nothing a little laser eye surgery won’t fix!",
        "Listen, I’m really glad you got the part.",
        "But are you sure you can do this?",
        "Now, is that never talking about it again?!",
        "I’m sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why don’t you uh, lift up your shirt? (He does.) Take a look at this kiddo. (Alex finally starts crying.) We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Oh, all right.",
        "Hi, my name’s Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?",
        "So, is Janine around?",
        "Can I check out what she did to my room?",
        "(The room is filled with flowers and a floral print sheet on the bed.) Oh my God. What is th… it’s like a guy never lived in here. Look, you’ve got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. (Looking around the living room.) It’s spreading already.",
        "(Picking up a pillow.) Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?",
        "(Pointing to the table and picking up the box.) Is that your tiny little box, that’s too small to put anything in?",
        "No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you’re going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.",
        "Yes talk to her. Be a man.",
        "Defend yourself.",
        "Be right there sweetums. (Monica leaves. To Joey.) A totally different situation.",
        "Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?",
        "Ohh, yeah.",
        "That’s weird. I don’t think my boss likes me either.",
        "Yeah let’s head off to work.",
        "You know…Oh My God.",
        "(Sarcastically) Really.",
        "Yeah, what was wrong with your old…human teeth.",
        "No, no no no. You’ll be fine. (turning to Monica) Hillary’s bind, right?",
        "Yeah. (Rachel walks in.)",
        "What???",
        "I am proud of all my friends today.",
        "Hi, I’m Chandler. Your live-in boy",
        "Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish. (Phoebe walks in.)",
        "Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I’m going to go over to Joey’s.",
        "Yes, but I feel like I’ve really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we’re two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.",
        "Nah, Nah, it’s okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.",
        "You know when guys hang out they don’t just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?",
        "No thanks, Josephine.",
        "Hey Ross, I was wondering if… Oh my God!! Where are all the men???",
        "Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.",
        "What is the matter with you ?!?",
        "You’re arranging flowers! (Pointing to the dish on the table.) You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!",
        "You’re turning into a women.",
        "Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?",
        "(not amused) And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.",
        "Hey!",
        "I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.",
        "Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.",
        "So, uh, wh-where ya from?",
        "Unbelievable",
        "Hey, look at all the boxes!",
        "All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?",
        "Now imagine you live at the supermarket.",
        "No-no",
        "OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. (Turns around and sees that Joey isn't there.) Joe? (Hears giggling coming from a box) Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack. (Hears the giggling again)",
        "(pretending) Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.",
        "Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica’s gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?",
        "Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?",
        "What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!",
        "Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.",
        "Yes I'm gonna put it back (Mocking Ross) exactly where I found it.",
        "She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.",
        "She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.",
        "I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.",
        "No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. (Picks up the phone and wipes it off) Phone's done ehh.",
        "Hey Mon, how's it going?",
        "Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.",
        "No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.",
        "It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! (To Ross) She's-she's gonna kill me.",
        "We should start with the big stuff. Y’know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. (He picks up one end and Ross doesn't help) I got it. (He moves it back to where he thinks it goes.)",
        "What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the...(Tries to rest his feet on the coffee table but they won't reach) OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.",
        "OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.",
        "Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!",
        "Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?",
        "Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.",
        "That's not specific to girls.",
        "And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.",
        "Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.",
        "Okay, is this lamp in the same place?",
        "(blocks the door) No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.",
        "(to Ross) I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.",
        "Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.",
        "Bye! Thank God",
        "Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.",
        "That's perfect! That's brilliant! (Starts going through the photo album)",
        "Uh-huh",
        "No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it. (Forced laughter)",
        "Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",
        "Do you want me to be afraid of you?",
        "Really?",
        "Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.",
        "Ba dum bumb cheshhh!",
        "That’s great!",
        "So you kissed her, so what happened after that?",
        "So she’s just waiting over there for ya?",
        "(entering) Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff. (Hands her all of her bills and stuff.)",
        "I’m not your garbage man. I’m your mailman.",
        "A pharmacist. (Rachel mocks him.)",
        "You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!",
        "You made pottery?",
        "Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore…",
        "…so then the farmer says, \"That’s not a cow and you’re not milking it.\" (Everyone laughs.)",
        "Look at us, we’re a couple of couples!",
        "Yeah all right. (They part.) Okay, good night guys.",
        "And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. (Hands it to him.) You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn’t afford it, because you paid dinner last night.",
        "Oh that’s too bad.",
        "That’s funny, I saw no phlegm.",
        "Then why-why is she going to a play?!",
        "Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!",
        "So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!",
        "And I am not blah, I am a hoot!",
        "No, you sh—No you said you made that up!!",
        "Eh, they’re both good. I generally just go with, Monica’s drunk again. (Monica glares at him.)",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay, one more time.",
        "Perfect decibel.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh nothing, we’re just talking. Y’know, blah-blah-blah.",
        "That’s totally understandable.",
        "Oh yeah!",
        "And I’m blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, (Imitating her) \"Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment.\"",
        "(To Monica) Y’know I think you can take her.",
        "Did you hear that?",
        "Yeah, I’m sorry man. (Pause) You wanna go watch?",
        "Hey so, did uh, did she move out?",
        "You okay?",
        "Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.",
        "I dunno what it is, it just doesn’t quite feel like Christmas to me.",
        "See now it feels like Christmas!",
        "Hey Joe what’s up?",
        "I can see why that’s hard to resist.",
        "You are aware that she’s not a monkey, right?",
        "Ah, you’re still just a little fat girl inside aren’t you? (He kisses her on the cheek)",
        "What, what are you laughing at?",
        "I don’t think so.",
        "(To Rachel) Oh my God!",
        "I can save you time ladies, I’m right here.",
        "What? That’s terrible!",
        "Oh well, that makes it not terrible.",
        "No not okay, you can’t look for Monica’s presents!",
        "No, you don’t have to, and you can’t because I live here too.",
        "Why?",
        "No, I have a great idea for a present for her.",
        "If I help, we can find ‘em faster!",
        "Y’know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don’t, you don’t do that every year do you?",
        "You don’t, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?",
        "Because that’s where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I’ve never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen! (He does a weird clicky motion with his fingers, that kinda hard to describe.)",
        "I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!",
        "Those are my gifts, I got them for you.",
        "Those are book ends! That's a great gift!",
        "Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?",
        "Oh, hey guys!",
        "Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.",
        "Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that’s as good as garbage?",
        "What?",
        "Oh great!",
        "Okay! Okay! Okay!",
        "Wait, we can’t do this.",
        "I don’t wanna know what Monica got me. Y’know? I mean, look, I’m sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.",
        "Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don’t know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica’s face when I give her my present, and I’m sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?",
        "Fine!",
        "That’s what you got me?",
        "Now you do that, you’re on TV.",
        "Sidney Poitier? Hehheh.",
        "Oh! That’s great, they haven’t seen the place since I moved in!",
        "(shocked at the news) Why can’t I tell them that we live together?",
        "Why haven’t you told them?!",
        "Why haven’t you told them?! Wouldn’t they be happy?!",
        "Why wouldn’t they be happy?",
        "What? What? Why?!",
        "Is this why they don’t like me or why you don’t like me?",
        "Y’know, it’ll be okay. It’ll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we’ll tell ‘em.",
        "Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn’t I?",
        "Hey! (Sees Ross is there) Oh, good, Ross! You’re parents like me, right?",
        "Well Monica just told me that they don’t.",
        "(annoyed) Do you know why?",
        "(angry) Well if people don’t know they shouldn’t just guess!",
        "This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.",
        "Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.",
        "[mocks that last comment].",
        "Hey.",
        "Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!",
        "Whoa, snowing out there?",
        "Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y’know I’ve always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.",
        "(worried) He’s the headliner of a gay burlesque show.",
        "Oh, yes. Well it’s very beautiful. It’s cream-colored and tight [Realizes what he just said and looks worried. Monica and Ross also looked shocked. Judy and Jack give Chandler a very dirty look.] I don’t mean tight, I mean it’s not too tight, not that I was looking at-[giving up all hope, he puts his head into his hands.]",
        "(shocked) What?",
        "You do? Why?",
        "What?! Why did you do that?",
        "How could it not matter?!",
        "What about all that “friends forever” stuff?",
        "Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!",
        "The reason we haven’t told them we’re together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?",
        "Yeah, I’m not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.",
        "(clearly lying and hating the dessert) Yeah, this is so good, that I’m gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.",
        "(lying) Yes, but if it’s any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.",
        "Thank you!",
        "(In a parent-like tone) I’ll talk to them!",
        "That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.",
        "I made that joke up.",
        "Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he’d ever heard.",
        "Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?",
        "Seriously?",
        "Yeah, I guess.",
        "(jumping up from his chair) Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke.",
        "It’s my joke.",
        "Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.",
        "Nah, Monica’s watching some cooking show. Come on, I don’t want to miss when they were skinny.",
        "What? No, I want to watch this. (He turns on the television and the screen is completely covered in snow). Did your cable go out?",
        "Joey, why is your cable out?",
        "If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?",
        "Whoa ho.",
        "(picks up the phone) All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?",
        "(with phone to ear, obviously hearing no dial tone) Paid your phone bill?",
        "Yeah.",
        "So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.",
        "And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions.",
        "(stops laughing, to Ross) You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.",
        "So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.",
        "Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Okay (he goes to sit down).",
        "(visibly upset) He took my joke, he took it.",
        "You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I’m going to get a joke journal. Y’know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Picking Rachel.",
        "Maybe it’s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.",
        "So is your apron. You’re wearing it like a cape.",
        "I think it’s great that you work here. You’re going to make a lot of money, and here’s your first tip: Don’t eat yellow snow. (He laughs, then picks up a pen, glares at Ross, and writes in his journal). Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.",
        "It’s my joke.",
        "It’s my joke.",
        "Let’s have Monica decide.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Mon, get out here!",
        "Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.",
        "Because you’re the only one that can be fair.",
        "(to Ross) Don’t try to sway her. (To Monica) (Softly) I’m your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let’s go.",
        "Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.",
        "Can I finish my story?!",
        "So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve’s doctor’s name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, ‘Doctor Monkey?’ And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up. (He slams his feet up on the table to emphasize his point.)",
        "I’m not arguing with that.",
        "Is not.",
        "Hi, oh hi.",
        "(starts to recite a rehearsed speech) Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. (Pause.) Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and—(He falters and Monica prompts him.)—generosity of spirit.",
        "(To Chandler) I’m out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?",
        "(pauses as he struggles with what he has to say) You’re a little high maintenance.",
        "I’m sorry. You’re not easy-going, but you’re passionate, and that’s good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that’s good too. So, they can say that you’re high maintenance, but it’s okay, because I like … maintaining you.",
        "(happily) I’m off the list. (Sits on the couch.)",
        "Hey, buddy boy, how’d the audition go?",
        "Hey.",
        "Joey! (Pause as they all stare at him.) No way. I’m not answering that.",
        "Hey!",
        "I’ll give up my ticket.",
        "And I think Ross is generous too.",
        "Hey!",
        "Ross.",
        "(on machine) You’ve reached Monica and Chandler’s, if you’re listening to this message, we’re probably screening. (to himself) Yeah we are.",
        "(on phone) This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! (Listens) Yes, the groom—No! Not the groom!!",
        "(gets up) See you later. (Starts to leave.)",
        "(angrily) Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask! (He storms out.)",
        "(on machine) This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! (The machine beeps off.)",
        "I’m not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday. (Does one of those Chandler noises.)",
        "Right here! (Clucks like a chicken for some reason.)",
        "Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!",
        "Okay.",
        "Yes, if it really doesn’t mean anything, because you know that I’m just not ready…",
        "Okay. (They hug.)",
        "Totally.",
        "Yeah, it’s beautiful.",
        "I know.",
        "Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there’s a big selling calendar, eh?",
        "A hot girl’s at stake and all of the sudden he’s Rain Man.",
        "Oh, is that against the rules?",
        "I see.",
        "Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.",
        "Oh, I don’t know man. I haven’t talked to her in like ten years.",
        "You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred…",
        "Oh okay, I’ll-I’ll try.",
        "Yeah so, Tuesday?",
        "(sarcastically) Thank you.",
        "You just thought of that in there?",
        "What are you smiling about? What is so funny?",
        "How’s your room Rach?",
        "Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?",
        "God, it’s great to catch up! I can’t believe how long it’s been!",
        "(on phone) Oh that’s great! Good for you.",
        "Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm… (Joey mimes throwing something in the air, catching it, rolling it out, putting it in an oven and cutting it.) Can you hold for one second please? (To Joey) What?!",
        "(on phone) Hi! I’m back. (Goes to hang up the phone.) Yeah, that sounds great. (Listens) Okay. Well, we’ll do it then. (Listens) Okay, bye-bye. (He hangs up the phone and turns around to see Joey standing close to him and screams.)",
        "Hi.",
        "(To Joey) We didn’t get to the audition. I’m gonna take her to coffee and then we’ll do it then.",
        "Honey, it is not a date! I haven’t talked to her in ten years! You can’t just call up somebody you haven’t talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y’know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.",
        "No, we only went out once.",
        "Not once!",
        "(laughs) Oh that’s great, my friend Joey’s in the movie business.",
        "(giggles) My friend’s name is Joey.",
        "Yeah, I’ve always hated that Howie.",
        "The nerve huh?",
        "Refill?",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "I couldn’t do it.",
        "Hey, relax I just need more time. We’re going to dinner tonight.",
        "Uh, Dana Keystone from college.",
        "No, that was Dana Caplin.",
        "Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!",
        "Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!",
        "Oh no-no-no, that’s not—No-no-no!",
        "No-no—Really?!",
        "(breaking up) Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh…",
        "Well maybe there is one thing you can do.",
        "Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?",
        "Well, the heart wants what it wants. I’ll see you later. (He runs off and leaves her with the bill, which the waiter promptly delivers.)",
        "(entering, sees Rachel’s throw) Ni-hi-ice!",
        "(To Joey) So, you busy Thursday?",
        "Okay. Okay. (Joey puts him down.) What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?",
        "Really?",
        "No! No! No! I was so careful! (Runs out.)",
        "Hey!",
        "So?!",
        "It’s Thursday! How was the audition?!",
        "This coming from the man who couldn’t split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.",
        "Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be at work?",
        "I’m so sorry you’re sick.",
        "I’m gonna grab you some tissue.",
        "Yes?",
        "Oh my God, introduce us!",
        "Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister! (Rachel glares at him.)",
        "I know, let’s rest and drink lots of fluids. (Holds up a glass of orange juice.)",
        "That would be impossible to resist if you weren’t all drippy here. (Points to his nose.)",
        "Yeah, I don’t you should say that even when you’re healthy.",
        "Don’t take this personally okay? It’s just that I just can’t have s*x with a sick person.",
        "That’s the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.",
        "Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? (He gets up from the couch and goes into the bedroom to find Monica, still in the robe, lying seductively on the bed. Or at least she’s trying too and as he enters the room, she takes the robe off on of her legs.) Oh-ohhhh!",
        "Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.",
        "I was asleep. (She takes off her robe and starts to shiver) Oh no! No-no honey! Y’know what’s sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.",
        "Would you please get some rest!",
        "Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!",
        "No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.",
        "No-no-no-no-no!",
        "Okay.",
        "So you’re just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?",
        "It’s nice.",
        "Yes! (Hangs his head in shame.)",
        "It’s all very, very good. (She covers up and sits down.) So you wanna go uh, mix it up?",
        "Oh come on you big faker!",
        "Well that was before all the vaporizing action.",
        "Okay! (Runs into the bedroom.)",
        "(calling from the bathroom) What are you doing here?",
        "We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.",
        "He’s taking off her coat!",
        "Ho-oh, he’s gonna get some! (Rachel looks at him.) Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y’know so umm, he’s closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. (Pause) Well, I’m off to bed! (Goes to bed.)",
        "Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.",
        "Sure I would!",
        "What, you guys really think that I’m that shallow?",
        "What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I’d probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job’s fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don’t have to wear a tie.",
        "(entering, depressed) Hey.",
        "Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not \"Archie Comic funny.\"",
        "Was his question what’s more boring than him?",
        "Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.",
        "Ehh.",
        "I could use the money; it could give me time to write.",
        "Okay!",
        "All right!",
        "Hey.",
        "Well it’s kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he’s not real.",
        "Uh-oh, it’s my boss!",
        "(reading the list) Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.",
        "What?",
        "But the Kit-Kats are all right?!",
        "Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!",
        "I always thought having a heart attack was nature’s way of telling you to die! (Phoebe glares at him.) But you’re not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you’re not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.",
        "Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, \"Bring me food.\" Two is, \"I’m with a girl, bring us food.\" Three is, \"I’m lost and I can’t find food.\"",
        "(approaching) Here you go Joe, here’s the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for. (Hands it to him.)",
        "Yeah?",
        "I’m sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.",
        "Okay, anything for you sir?",
        "It’s not all juice! (Rachel quickly gets out of the way.)",
        "Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!",
        "Aww.",
        "You wanna share it?",
        "What’s this?",
        "Aww, thanks man. (They hug.)",
        "Oh you wouldn’t uh, care. It’s just a stupid comic book story.",
        "Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy (Joey laughs), uh but he doesn’t want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist—as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can’t have lumps in them.",
        "No, the doctors say it may kill her.",
        "(To Ross) But I think we should tell her.",
        "Listen Phoebe, he’s right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.",
        "Uh, what about y’know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.",
        "I’m sorry you’re here with me instead of Roger.",
        "Well, I could make it seem like he’s here. (Imitates him.) \"Here’s some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn’t add the second cous until 1979.\" (Mumbles something further.)",
        "Okay.",
        "What was tonight?",
        "Okay. (Pause.) What was tonight?",
        "With Roger? (Monica shyly looks away.) Not just with Roger?! (Monica shrugs.) Oh my God!",
        "Four different women! I’ve had s*x way more times!",
        "Nine.",
        "Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?",
        "Hey that’s what I tell girls about me.",
        "No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.",
        "Okay. (They both realize what he just said.)",
        "So was I.",
        "We can’t do this.",
        "Yeah! (Takes it.) If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y’know? Because you’ve been waiting a very long time and I wouldn’t want to disappoint you.",
        "I do like that.",
        "Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?",
        "Stop it! We’re doing this! Let’s do it!",
        "Okay! (They both get up.)",
        "I have some moves.",
        "Yeah, let’s just forget it.",
        "Okay!",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "(sexily) Yeah?",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Oh, okay! (He rolls over to do that again.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!",
        "So you uh, want to do something tonight?",
        "Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you’re still seeing him and uh, he’s a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when… (He fakes falling asleep.)",
        "Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?",
        "I bet he can.",
        "Oh yeah! Yeah! Don’t worry about me, I’ll be fine! (Does a kara-tay move.)",
        "(sticking his head in the door) Okay to come in?",
        "Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?",
        "I’m the ruptured spleen. (Laughs.)",
        "Because you shouldn’t be with him. (Pause.) You should be with me.",
        "Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don’t just happen. Y’know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning y’know I was just lying there and I couldn’t wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y’know with a friend.",
        "I know you probably don’t want to go out with me, y’know because I make too many jokes and I’ve never been in a serious relationship and I guess I’m not technically a \"doctor…\"",
        "No, there were two.",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here. (Pats Joey’s arm, Joey pats Chandler’s shoulder, and Chandler motions for Joey to say the same about him.)",
        "So he has to be a male who has at least $50.",
        "(laughs) Isn’t she cute? (On Monica’s death stare) No!",
        "So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?",
        "Oh, tell her good luck with that.",
        "Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?",
        "Oh that’s so funny because we found someone too.",
        "Why would our guy be a weirdo?",
        "A face ass?",
        "No, our guy is just a floating head.",
        "(horrified) Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.",
        "Our guy has great hair.",
        "Our guy smells incredible.",
        "Hey.",
        "Well, you…don’t look good Joe.",
        "That’s still in there?!",
        "Is this a service you’re providing me?",
        "Our new fridge? I don’t live here anymore.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "(not quite sure where Joey’s going and is a little worried) Okay…",
        "Just tell her the truth! Tell her you’re not ready.",
        "Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.",
        "Joey, I saw you push him!",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Hey!",
        "Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break? (Does a little whooping/party noise.)",
        "I can see it now, \"Look dad, it’s the Sphinx!\" (Does that party noise again.)",
        "Yeah.",
        "Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!",
        "Are you funny?",
        "(To Monica) Turns out he is kinda funny.",
        "Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat’s name?",
        "Okay, so you will meet our guys?",
        "Okay now it doesn’t matter which one you choose, y’know? It’s completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.",
        "(To Ross) Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?",
        "You know the hotels?",
        "Well, maybe you don’t marry this one.",
        "Good-good-good-good.",
        "Hey!",
        "Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y’know what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? (Laughs) Eldad come here! (He stands up from the next table.)",
        "Eldad, sit down. (To Rachel) Move over! Move over now!",
        "There you go! There you are! (Rachel stares at Monica and Chandler)",
        "Hi. (To Phoebe) Okay, you’re too late okay? Because she’s already with our guy.",
        "It is the softest hair! Touch it! (Both he and Monica do so.)",
        "(To Rachel) Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! (To Eldad) You dance for Rachel!",
        "So what was it for anyway?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.",
        "I see where you’re goin’!",
        "(reminiscing) Ah, finally an explanation.",
        "Hey-hey, is Monica here?",
        "Okay, look I need your help, I don’t know what to get her for Valentine’s Day.",
        "(laughs) She was working on Valentine’s Day so we’re celebrating it tonight.",
        "Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend (pause) and her brother, (the camera pans to Ross flashing Joey a very evil look; Joey gets scared) I can’t do that we promised we’d make each other gifts this year.",
        "Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.",
        "I made a… (Does one of those gibberish words.)",
        "Nothing!",
        "Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?",
        "(admiring his work) This, this actually is a… (Does the same gibberish word from before.)",
        "Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine’s Day gifts?",
        "Do we have to make the entire thing?",
        "Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.",
        "(sticking his head back in) What?",
        "Hey.",
        "What?!",
        "Okay, are you aware unagi (does the finger thing) is an eel?",
        "I can’t figure out what to make Monica.",
        "I’m going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?",
        "Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.",
        "Wait a minute, I can’t give this to her.",
        "Because it says \"Captain Ross\" on the side and \"I hate Monica\" on the bottom.",
        "Okay. Okay. (He goes to the closet, moves the clothes out of the way, and notices an empty hanger. He takes the empty hanger and bends it all out of shape. Then he holds it out as if he’s giving it to her.) Yes honey, I made it myself. (He throws it down and goes to her chest, grabs something, goes to the bed table, and takes out a pair of scissors. He turns around and holds the scissors to the crotch of the panties he just removed.) I can’t do it. I can’t do it. (He throws them both down and continues looking. He opens another closet door and finds a tape.) Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!! (He runs out into the living room.)",
        "Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?",
        "Okay, come here! Come here.",
        "Now, it’s not wrapped because I just, just finished it.",
        "But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.",
        "(momentarily terrified) Maybe we’ll have to listen and see!",
        "Okay!",
        "Yeah!",
        "It’s a sock bunny.",
        "Not really.",
        "I see. Y’know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.",
        "Oh, it’s okay. I don’t…",
        "(thinking it over) Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape. (They both run into the bedroom.)",
        "Wow! (To the sock bunny still on his hand.) You are way to young to have seen that!",
        "You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.",
        "Yeah! (Takes it off his hand and throws it behind the night-stand.)",
        "You have done enough!",
        "No you don’t—get it in black, not brown.",
        "Oop!",
        "Well, it’s like that old saying, have some s*x, eat some cake.",
        "Who the hell is Carl?!",
        "Y’know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren’t they?",
        "Oh my good God.",
        "Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.",
        "Oh, the mixed tape.",
        "No! You’re the sweetest! (He tries to kiss her but Monica backs away with a look that could kill on her face.)",
        "I am so, so, so, so sorry!",
        "And I will cook anything you want in here (points to the kitchen), and do anything in there! (Points to the bedroom.)",
        "Come on Monica, it’s our Valentine’s Day. Please? Please-please, please?",
        "Okay. (They hug.)",
        "So, are we going in there?",
        "Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can’t figure this out! It’s so hard! Should I get her a (turning to each page) Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a—ah-ah! Paper cut!",
        "No, I don’t want to tell anybody else because I don’t want Monica to find out.",
        "Well, it’s because I trust you, you’re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.",
        "Me too.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh all right.",
        "Oh well, we don’t because we got…the…other pl-place.",
        "Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we’ve been too and I can’t find the perfect ring! (Goes over to another display counter and starts pointing at rings.) Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! (Notices that one of the jewelers is watching him.) It’s a beautiful selection. (The jeweler walks away slowly.)",
        "Y’know, I’m so glad I picked you to help me with this.",
        "Yeah, I’m gonna stick with the ring. (Goes to another display counter.) Oh, this one’s nice! (Pointing to another ring.) I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?",
        "Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.",
        "Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you…hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?",
        "(choking up) Oh my God that’s it, that’s the ring! How much is it?",
        "Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.",
        "Uh, credit card. (Reaches for it then realizes) Oh no! No-no, but I left my credit card with Joey. (To Phoebe) Okay, I’ll go get it. You guard the ring.",
        "No. How are ya Paul? (Starts to look for his credit card.)",
        "No, did he hug you?!",
        "Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.",
        "Yeah?",
        "I’m a little busy here Paul.",
        "Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. (Paul rushes over and hugs Chandler tightly.) Oh hey! There you go. (The hug continues.) Okay. (The hug continues.)",
        "Okay! (Pushes him away.)",
        "Do you have my credit card?",
        "Thank God! (Grabs his card.)",
        "Oh, I can’t go.",
        "Oh, that’s uh, that’s pretty nice but I’m gonna go with the one I picked first.",
        "What?",
        "They put you in jail?",
        "Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!",
        "Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.",
        "It was the ring!",
        "I can’t believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!",
        "No, it’s not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica’s face when I gave it to her, y’know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. (Does so and laughs.) Look, this is the most important thing I’m gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it’s perfect.",
        "I can’t do that.",
        "Okay and he hasn’t proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.",
        "Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.",
        "(to him) Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you’re about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I’m gonna need to have that back. (The guy isn’t sure.) But, in exchange I’m willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. (Looking at the ring.) Ew.",
        "No-no! This is my fiancee (Phoebe) and her heart was set on that ring. You don’t want to break her heart now do you?",
        "Yeah, she’s dying… Of a cough apparently.",
        "(interrupting her) Okay, that’s enough honey!",
        "Great! Okay, here. (Holds the ring up for him.)",
        "Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! (To his girlfriend) And you are about to marry a wonderful man! (She stunned and he’s horrified.) Hey! I’m marrying a dead woman!",
        "Guys? (They ignore him.) I’ve got something important to tell ya. (Still nothing so he walks over and stands in front of the TV.) Guys? (They lean over to try and watch the TV, Chandler mimics them.) Guys?! (Pause) I’m gonna ask Monica to marry me.",
        "Yeah, check out the ring. (Shows it to them.)",
        "Yep, pretty much.",
        "(goes to hug him and stops short) Heyyyy—What?",
        "Okay! (They hug.) I was gonna wait ‘til uh, it was official y’know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you’re my best friends.",
        "I’m gonna ask Monica to marry me.",
        "I know.",
        "Check out the ring.",
        "Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right? (Ross and Joey look at each other and go back to watching the game on TV.) Guys? Guys? (Walks in front of them again.)",
        "(To Joey) So uh, what’s this thing you’re auditioning for?",
        "That is lucky.",
        "Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?",
        " Whoa, she's pretty. (Mentioning the girl on TV)",
        " Oh, ok.",
        "Oh no, it's terrific, it's- it's- y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into show business.",
        "Oh, are we playing this?!",
        "Hey! How’d the audition go?",
        "So it did go well.",
        "Oh that’s great!",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Oh-oh, what are you doing?",
        "Well, it is overdue.",
        "(on phone) Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!",
        "Oh come on guys, it’s not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren’t for (struggles to get this out) Monica’s allergies. (The duck quacks.) You’re right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. (The phone rings.) Should I get that? (Laughs, then answers the phone.) Hello? (Listens) Uh no, Joey’s not here right now. Can I take a message? (Listens) Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? (Listens) Okay great. (Listens.) Bye. (Hangs up the phone and goes to write the message on the Magna-Doodle on the door but Monica walks in and forces him to jump out of the way.)",
        "(looks down at his clothes) Am I naked again?!",
        "Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?",
        "Oh right, your allergies. (Monica leaves and to the chick and duck) All her, she hates you. (Chandler leaves without finishing the message for Joey.)",
        "As crazy as soccer?",
        "You mean you didn’t get it from this?",
        "Well, maybe we can fix it y’know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!",
        "I messed up. Okay? I’m sorry, I really messed up.",
        "Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody’s allowed one mistake, right?",
        " You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller!  The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!",
        " Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. [Joey walks in behind Chandler]",
        " I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . [turns around and sees Joey] Hi!",
        " Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and…",
        " No! No! No! I just kissed her.",
        " How is that worse?!",
        " You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.",
        "Look, I’m not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you’re not perfect! You’ve made some errors in judgment too!",
        "(lets him out) What happened?!!",
        " What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!",
        " So--You got in voluntarily?!",
        " BEND OVER?!!!",
        "Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.",
        "...And what did you bring?",
        "Janice?",
        "Janice?!",
        "Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.",
        "Oh come on!  He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...",
        "Cupping.",
        "I can’t believe I did this! What an idiot!",
        "Do you think he’ll ever forgive me?",
        "Y’know what? I-I kinda have.",
        "You didn’t see how mad he was, y’know?",
        "(coming out from behind the door) I KNEW IT!!!!",
        "Oh my God! ",
        "Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe? (The phone rings and he answers it) (On phone) Hello? (Takes the phone away from his mouth when he realizes what he just did and yells.) Damnit! (Back on phone.) Hello? (Listens.) No, Joey’s not here right now, but I can take a message I think. (Listens) He’s still got a chance for the part?! Oh, that’s great news! (Listens) Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. (Listens) Oh well, that’s great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you! (Hangs up and goes to write the message on the Magna-Doodle.) Yes! (Reading what he’s writing) Okay, Mac audition at 2:00. Allergy actor attacked. (Pause) By dog not flowers.",
        "Please tell me you got the message!",
        "The actor playing Mac couldn’t do it, they needed to see you at 2 o’clock.",
        "Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross’s! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!",
        "Sorry! I-I-I don’t know what to say.",
        "(angrily) Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!",
        "Y’know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!",
        "Well that’s good. Because you didn’t! And I’m incredibly happy for ya!!",
        "Oh, we could do this all day.",
        "You are gonna be a huge star! I’m gonna hug ya!",
        "All right!",
        "I think so. Yeah, get off me.",
        "Okay.",
        "(To Monica) Oh, well thank you in advance. (Kisses her.)",
        "Hey!!",
        "Oh that’s right. It’s your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?",
        "Are you judging them by their covers? Because you’re really not supposed to do that.",
        "Hey!",
        "Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not Elizabeth’s dad?!",
        "Ross!",
        "There’s a Mr. Bing!",
        "But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh, funny story… (He starts laughing then notices that Paul isn’t happy.) You’re roommate in college died didn’t he?",
        "Yes, we were just…",
        "Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.",
        "No, the little girl creeps me out.",
        "Why would the baby creep me out?",
        "This is going in your book?",
        "Hey!",
        "Damn those robots, they’re supposed to be our faithful servants!",
        "So do you think uh, Joey’s more charming than me?",
        "Yeah, you wish. (Stops to think about it and gets depressed.)",
        "Who?",
        "Hmm.",
        "Oh.",
        "Oh-oh.",
        "We said seven!",
        "The only way that I said six would be if the seven’s, let meet at seven, not at six.",
        "Oh my good God.",
        "What?!",
        "(disgusted) What does it say?!",
        "Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.",
        "(To Monica) I told you I should not wear this color. (He’s wearing a reddish-orange sweater.)",
        "So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!",
        "Oh I’m so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?",
        "Hi, how are ya?",
        "(whispering in Joey’s ear) The reason he just said.",
        "Yeah, I’ve been there my friend.",
        "Okay, well tonight’s the big night.",
        "It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I’m going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I’m just gonna propose.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I’m not gonna mess it up.",
        "She’s not gonna say no.",
        "Hey!",
        "(To Phoebe) Give me it!",
        "Phoebe!",
        "(with his mouthful) Hi Monica.",
        "Hey!",
        "(glaring at her) Well, Monica and Chandler can’t go. We’re going to dinner remember?!",
        "I just get mad when Rachel doesn’t remember where we’re going.",
        "Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.",
        "Oh, so you’re already doing your part for the kids.",
        "Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn’t agree to that!",
        "Will you marry me? Will you marry me? (Makes like a gun with his fingers.) Hey, you marry me! (He gives up as Joey, Rachel, Phoebe, and Ross slink in all excited.) What’s going on little elves?",
        "Yeah, right here in my pocket. (Pats his pocket. Phoebe smiles, goes over to hug him, and removes the ring from his pocket.) Pheebs?",
        "Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she’s gonna know.",
        "(To Monica) You look beautiful.",
        "(trying to cover up why his hand is over his heart) One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. (Laughs.) I remembered it. (It’s a butchered version of the Pledge of Allegiance of the United States for our foreign friends.) The champagne is here. (The waiter is delivering it and pouring two glasses.)",
        "Yes! Yes! I’m good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything—are you—are you perrr-perfect?!",
        "Oh, yeah. (Starts to take it off and then realizes) Uh, no you can’t have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should’ve brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?",
        "Yes! I’m fine. In fact I’ve been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.",
        "Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn’t imagine growing old with…",
        "(not knowing the true meaning of her exclamation) I know, but just let me say it.",
        "What?! I’m Chandler! (She nods towards the doorway, Chandler turns and looks) Oh, that’s Richard!",
        "Hey-hey, hey! (Gets up and hugs him.) I don’t know why I did that!",
        "(to Richard’s date) And uh, you don’t have a mustache which is good. (She just smiles.) I’m Chandler; I make jokes when I’m uncomfortable.",
        "Hi.",
        "Richard! No one supposed to know about us! (Richard just smiles at him.) See I, did it again.",
        "Yeah, I’ll sit down. (He slides back into his chair.)",
        "Yes. (Thinking he’s gone.)",
        "I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.",
        "What?!",
        "(stopping him from going any further) Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!",
        "Richard!",
        "Oh you knew that. Good!",
        "For camp!",
        "Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you’re not careful you may not get married at all this year!",
        "(after the door closes) What did you guys just do?!",
        "Richard was there so I couldn’t do it!",
        "I’m gonna do it tomorrow y’know, and-and surprise her, but now you’ve ruined it!",
        "Who walks into a room and asks to see a person’s hands?!",
        "This is terrible. What am I going to do?",
        "That’s right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.",
        "I can do that, I’ve had 30 years of practice.",
        "Okay, okay, here she comes! (Sits on the couch next to him.) How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn’t want to get married?",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, just hanging out, talkin’ about uh, websites. (Joey laughs.) Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.",
        "Yeah, well… Y’know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?",
        "Eh…",
        "Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let’s take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don’t mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that’s good at sports!",
        "If marriage worked, I’d be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.",
        "Well, never say never but y’know probably uh yeah, never.",
        "Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don’t you put down your copy of ‘The Rules’ huh mantrap?!",
        "(to them) It’s okay, I got a plan.",
        "I was making a coconut phone with the professor.",
        "What?!",
        "My—Oh my God!",
        "He’s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I’m supposed to do that!",
        "Well what… Y’know what I’m gonna do? I’m gonna go over there; I’m gonna kick his ass! (Pause) Will you help me?!",
        "You’re right.",
        "Okay. (Starts running for the bedroom) I’m gonna get the ring! I’m gonna get the ring! (Does so) I’m gonna go find her and (starts running for the door) I’m just going to propose!",
        "Okay great.",
        "What?!",
        "Where is she? I’m not scared of you! (Averts his eyes and walks in.)",
        "(examining the coffee table) Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!",
        "Well where did she go?",
        "Oh my God, I can’t believe this! Y’know, I thought…I thought you were a good guy.",
        "Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn’t tell my girlfriend that you love her?",
        "Y’know what? I can’t believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!",
        "And what does she have to think about? I love her!",
        "But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y’know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she’d be surprised!",
        "It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn’t fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! (Sits down heavily.) I was gonna propose tonight.",
        "Yeah I even (pause) got a ring. (Puts in on the center cushion.) Did you get a ring?",
        "Y’know Richard…you are a good guy.",
        "I can’t talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!",
        "What?",
        "What are you talking about?",
        "Well why didn’t you stop her?! Why didn’t you just tell her it was a plan?!",
        "Well where… Where did she go?",
        "I can’t believe I ruined this.",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought… (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cry again.) And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you marry me?",
        "Hey.",
        "Monica and I are engaged.",
        "Thanks.",
        "(To Ross) Okay, you get her in here. (To Joey) You bolt the door. I’ll be in the closet.",
        "It’s okay, I want this to be your night too. (Raises his class.) To Monica.",
        "To Monica!",
        "So when you said, \"Get up early,\" did you mean 1986?",
        "Okay.",
        "Know what I mean?",
        "There’s gonna be a wedding. You’re gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.",
        "(motioning with his hands) I’m not worried, I’m uh, I’m fascinated. Y’know it’s like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me. (Exits as Phoebe enters from her room with her guitar.)",
        "Sure, you guys don’t have this problem, you’re made of wood. (Rachel comes out of the bathroom) Hey!",
        "You look great!",
        "You okay over there?",
        "Oh, don’t worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.",
        "(putting his hands up) Take whatever you want, just please don’t hurt me.",
        "Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.",
        "Young! You’re a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody’s ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!",
        "Joe?",
        "Uh, you’ve had a lot of s*x right?",
        "Well, it’s just the reason that I’m asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to—I mean I really wanted to, but I couldn’t…. There huh—hmm, there-there was an incident.",
        "It’s happened to you?",
        "Well, what’d you do?",
        "(angrily) I don’t think that’s what they were talking about Joe!!",
        "What?!",
        "Yes, you can pass for 19.",
        "Yes!",
        "Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!",
        "Now Monica, I know you’re upset, but don’t forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there’s going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.",
        "We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la (mumbles something).",
        "Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it’s romantic, but because I can!",
        "Okay, don’t say anything, you might scare it away.",
        "It’s Paris, who knows we’re here!",
        "Pheebs, we’re not giving you a deposit for our wedding!",
        "Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don’t care!",
        "What a great apology! (To Monica) And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!",
        "(entering) Ahh, third base.",
        "(To Ross) Why to save your dignity my man.",
        "Well, somebody should. (Monica glares at him.)",
        "How is that ever going to happen?!",
        "(To Ross) I don’t care, she slept with me.",
        "Thanks.",
        "(interrupting her just in time) Hey! Here’s a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.",
        "Okay. (Goes back to bed.)",
        "What’s the matter honey?",
        "(incredulous) Already?!",
        "Oh, I got some thoughts on that.",
        "What in God’s name is that?!",
        "Well, you couldn’t get them anyway. Ian doesn’t play anymore and Derrick… (Off of Rachel and Monica’s looks) And Derrick is a name I shouldn’t know.",
        "Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?",
        "Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?",
        "Okay.",
        "Centerpieces!",
        "Definitely roses. (Monica and Rachel exchange a look.) Well, I just think they’re a little more weddingy. (Monica holds the Lily picture closer to him.) But Lilies are the clear choice.",
        "Uh-huh!",
        "Oh yeah, I should probably call them.",
        "Oh, I don’t think I ever heard that story.",
        "What a sweet story.",
        "Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal. (Starts to make up for lost time and takes a big swig of his drink.)",
        "I don’t know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She’s saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to (Pause) Dollywood.",
        "Honey, it’s gonna be okay.",
        "Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we’re gonna get married.",
        "Well, I have some.",
        "Well, close to… (Notices Rachel leaning in to hear and decides to write it on a piece of paper and hand it to Monica as Phoebe averts her eyes.)",
        "Well, you’re not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?",
        "Well, come on, I’ve been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.",
        "No, I realize that honey, but I’m not gonna spend all of the money on one party.",
        "Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.",
        "Yes, I am!",
        "Hey.",
        "Ehh.",
        "Look, I thought about it too, and I’m sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.",
        "Yeah, I’m putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that’s what we’re gonna do.",
        "Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y’know? We’ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.",
        "Well, stuff like where’d we live, y’know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y’know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we’d have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.",
        "Sure you do.",
        "You sure?",
        "I love you so much.",
        "Oh yeah, totally!",
        "It’s your mommy. It’s your mommy.",
        "That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.",
        "And say nothing?",
        "No-no-no-no. (Waves him away as Monica and Phoebe enter whispering to each other.) Hey! (Monica shushes him.)",
        "Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?",
        "Secret? Married people aren’t supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.",
        "No I’m serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.",
        "Oh no-no, I can’t do that.",
        "Okay.",
        "So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we’re on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.",
        "No, he visited a little town south of throw up. (Monica laughs hysterically.) So what was Phoebe’s secret?",
        "That’s it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?",
        "(angrily) Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!",
        "What about him?",
        "Let me see this guy. (Phoebe hands him the picture.) W-H-Wow! Don’t show this to Monica! And don’t tell her about the W-H-Wow!",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh it’s always nicer to hear than, \"Aw crap! You again!\"",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh yeah?",
        "Did you not understand the story?",
        "Hey! What’s up?",
        "Huh.",
        "No! (The oven dings.) Shhh!",
        "Nancy Thompson’s getting fired! (Monica slaps him on the shoulder.)",
        "I had to okay?! We’re getting married! Married couples can’t keep secrets from one another!",
        "Du-ude!",
        "Did you not hear me say, \"Du-ude?!\"",
        "In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.",
        "Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?",
        "You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!",
        "Ross came in fourth and cried!",
        "(To Monica) Of course it is. (Mouths to Ross) Wow—whoa!",
        "Hey!!!",
        "That was you!",
        "(To Monica) You have no trouble telling time now right?",
        "Quick! What time is it?! (Holds his watch in front of her face.)",
        "Y’know when I said that because we’re getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?",
        "Yeah that was stupid. Let’s not do that.",
        "Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn’t hang out with…all the guys in my office.",
        "Hey, you guys!",
        "So, what do you think?",
        "Are you kidding? Okay, I’ll give you a hint; I’ll give you a hint. (Points to his glasses.)",
        "I got glasses!",
        "No I didn’t!",
        "No!",
        "Really?",
        "(sitting down on the arm of her chair) You didn’t think I used to wear glasses, right?",
        "That’s okay Pheebs, we’re not having a party or anything, so you don’t have to get us…",
        "What we want honey.",
        "Dying people say the craziest things.",
        "Our kids are gonna be fat aren’t they.",
        "Hey! How’s the boat?!",
        "Well, it’s good that you finally have a place to do that.",
        "Do you know what I was thinkin’?",
        "Nothing, I just like to go like this. (Does it again.)",
        "Uh why, do you have a lecture?",
        "Then free as a bird. What’s up?",
        "Well, did-did you correct him?",
        "Oh no problem, maybe I’ll play with my left hand.",
        "Does anybody know me?!",
        "Don’t worry about it Pheebs.",
        "An old cookie?",
        "We can’t accept this.",
        "‘Cause it’s gross.",
        "Okay, we owe you a present.",
        "I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.",
        "Daddy. All right look, here’s the story. (Flashback to Chandler about to enter the steam room as he does the voice-over.) Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. (The flashback shows his glasses fog up and him trying to find his way around the steam-filled room. He takes off his glasses.) So I take off my glasses and that’s when it happened.",
        "Guys?",
        "I know.",
        "Why do they put so much steam in there?!",
        "Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?",
        "Not that big a deal? There…there was touching of things.",
        "I don’t want him to tell this story for years.",
        "If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!",
        "(getting up) All right, I’m off to see your dad.",
        "Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face—And by face I don’t mean his lap. And by face, I don’t mean my ass. (Exits.)",
        "So you understand, I’d feel a lot more comfortable if you didn’t tell people what happened. Y’know, I’m a little…I’m a little embarrassed about it.",
        "What did you do when they found out?",
        "So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!",
        "Hey.",
        "Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!",
        "What are you guys doing?",
        "Oooh, I’m afraid that does not exist.",
        "No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who’s going like this… (Makes what can only be described as a toothy frown. Henceforth, this shall be known as The Face.)",
        "I don’t know what it is, I just can’t take a good picture.",
        "Yeah, I’m not in that.",
        "All right, but I should warn you, I’m not going. I’m going. (Does The Face while saying that last part.)",
        "How about those three-pointers?",
        "And those guys were this (Doing the standard \"This Close\" gesture) close to lettin’ us play this time too.",
        "Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.",
        "They have that on the napkins at the club.",
        "Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y’know you can’t date him right?",
        "Dude that is so sad.",
        "Could I play?",
        "Okay. (Does The Face.)",
        "No, I am.",
        "I do? (He smiles, beautifully.)",
        "Okay. (You’ll have to see it, I can’t describe the face he makes, but it isn’t good.)",
        "Aww! (Smiles.)",
        "Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?",
        "I can’t help it!",
        "Borrow money from me?",
        "Why is there jelly on your shoe?",
        "Hey!",
        "(Pause) I’m right here!",
        "I’m still right here!",
        "Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?",
        "Can you people not see me?! (He waves his arms around to get their attention.)",
        "There I am!",
        "Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.",
        "Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!",
        "I don’t know, but don’t worry, don’t worry, because I know how to take a picture now. (They get ready) Okay, see? Look down (Looks down), look down, look down… (He falls asleep.)",
        "(awakens) Yeah! (Looks up and does The Face.)",
        "Ahhh.",
        "Oh yeah, that looks good.",
        "Okay.",
        "I’m marrying her.",
        "Die Hard still great!",
        "What’d you rent?",
        "(looking at the tape) Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.",
        "Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.",
        "No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.",
        "That’s sweet.",
        "So uh, what did this woman look like?",
        "Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?",
        "No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive… (Thinks a little while.) Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.",
        "Well, let’s see… (Finding the picture he wants.) Okay uh, is that her? (Pointing to the picture.)",
        "Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.",
        "(pause) No, we’re still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.",
        "Well, ‘cause she came back the third summer and she’d gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow…",
        "I did not say fat! I said, \"Fa-aa-aw-ow…\"",
        "Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?",
        "Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. (Monica is not amused by that statement.) Seriously, good luck marrying me.",
        "Can you figure out what I’m doing?",
        "Who?",
        "Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!",
        "What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.",
        "Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you fell in love with!",
        "(she opens the door) Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.",
        "(To Monica) It’s a nickname, I’ll explain later.",
        "Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.",
        "You-you-you didn’t know that. (Pause as she nods no.) Well, I guess my work here is done!",
        "As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.",
        "I would really love it if I could do both.",
        "What?",
        "What?!",
        "A hundred and forty-five pounds.",
        "Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!",
        "Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.",
        "You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!",
        "Look you have to realize I don’t think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. (Monica glares at him.) See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you’re Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.",
        "So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.",
        "I’d carry you around in my pocket.",
        "Skidmark’s still got a way with the ladies.",
        "Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there. (Does so.)",
        "Okay. Okay.",
        "That sounds like my first bike. (They all turn and look at him.) My dad gave me his old one.",
        "Hey! What are you guys doing?",
        "I’m sorry, who?",
        "But we don’t know the neighbors.",
        "Wouldn’t it be easier if we just moved?",
        "Eh, somebody’s in a good mood!",
        "Well, either that or uh…(Motions towards Joey’s door.)",
        "(about to cry) Am not!",
        "Don’t worry, I’m brave! I am brave! I…I am brave! (They get to the door and Monica goes to open it.) No-no-no-no!! (He stops her.) (Through the door.) Can you tell me who is there please?",
        "(laughs) 4:00 A.M.",
        "I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! (Monica looks at him) (To Monica) He does not know that I am not some of us.",
        "Mm! Night Gar’! (Monica closes the door.)",
        "Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!",
        "Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?",
        "(with his mouth full) What happened? I’m just eating candy.",
        "Absolutely! Y’know, because tushie can mean both ass and good worker.",
        "What is the matter with you?",
        "Maybe, isn’t she the woman who lives below you and has s*x really loud?",
        "Yeah, that’s her.",
        "Y’know what would work?",
        "Stop making candy!",
        "You mean they like you.",
        "Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?",
        "(asking a man leaning against the wall) What is going on?",
        "Joey!",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Get in here! (They head for the door and Chandler sees Smokes-A-Lot Lady standing next to the door and smoking, to her) Hey, and you can not smoke in here! (Takes the cigarette and takes a drag for himself.) (Exhaling in ecstasy) Merry Christmas.",
        "All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! (They settle down) What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I’ll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?",
        "No not (imitating) Candy Lady.",
        "All right, y’know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You’ve ruined it! Go home! You’ve ruined it! You’ve ruined it!",
        "You’re welcome. (They kiss.)",
        "No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh—are you okay?",
        "…Come on! Why are we here?!",
        "The hot chicks?",
        "Wow that’s actually pretty cool.",
        "Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.",
        "You didn’t bring me here to do that, did you?",
        "OH…MY…GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn’t tell her we were getting married, did you?",
        "Did she freak out?",
        "Right.",
        "(laughs) You said no, right?",
        "You said no, right?!",
        "Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check’s in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can’t wait to read your book, Ross!!",
        "What do you think, she’s just gonna sit there quietly? You don’t think she’s gonna want to make a toast? You don’t think she’s gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!",
        "Y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. Y’know what? She’s probably not gonna even want to come.",
        "No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?",
        "Yes!!",
        "Yes!!!",
        "Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it’s going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We’re not even sure why we’re having it.",
        "I say we go with Careless Whisper.",
        "(To Monica) Did she see us yet? Did she see us?",
        "Aren’t you just a tinsy bit curious?",
        "No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!",
        "Is that what you’re thinking about right now?",
        "Janice, I’m sorry but umm, you can’t stay here tonight.",
        "Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.",
        "Say again?",
        "Feelings, such strong feelings.",
        "I just wanted to show Monica your book. (Ross just glares at him.)",
        "Buh-bye. (Hangs up the phone) I just got us reservations at Michelle’s and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.",
        "…betrothed couple.",
        "Hey!",
        "Pheebs?",
        "Skull?",
        "How long have we been home?",
        "Lovely!",
        "Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?",
        "Why not?",
        "Hey!",
        "Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?",
        "Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.",
        "No reason, except…she…told…me.",
        "No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.",
        "Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?",
        "(to the Maitre d') Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please? (Laughs.)",
        "Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.",
        "Is this because of the burrito thing?",
        "Give him money? It was a joke!",
        "Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.",
        "Hey, I can be smooth. (Walks back to the Maitre d', very smoothly) Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it. (Shakes his hand)",
        "Okay. (Walks back to Monica)",
        "Had the money in the wrong hand. (Shows her his left hand with the money in it)",
        "How do you know so much about this?",
        "Richard used to do it, didn't he?",
        "Mustached b*st*rd…",
        "(walks up to the Maitre d') Excuse me...",
        "(finds his money) Ahh-hahaha! (Turns around to give the Maitre d' his money, but he isn't there anymore)",
        "Thank you Gunther, put it there. (He gets up, and shakes Gunther's hand. A bunch of coins fall out his hand. He sits down next to Monica.) Definitely not easier with coins. (Joey gets up and picks up the coins. Chandler thinks, Joey is just helping him to pick them up.) Thank you.",
        "Hey Pheebs!",
        "If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway?",
        "(entering in a Santa costume) Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!",
        "Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)",
        "Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird…turtle-man?",
        "What?",
        "You bet I did, Ben, put it there! (He shakes Ben's hand, but the money falls out of his hands) (to Monica) Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! (Realizes, that Ben is standing right there) Ho, ho, ho!",
        "You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!",
        "Why?",
        "But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.",
        "Fine, I'll give the suit back.",
        "Santa? Really?",
        "Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?",
        "Then it's okay! (They kiss.)",
        "Because, if Santa and the Holiday…Armadillo? (Ross nods) ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!",
        "Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?",
        "My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt. (Glaring at Joey who’s nodding.)",
        "No, no, no. No-no-no.",
        "No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.",
        "Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen (looks over to Monica).",
        "Oh, okay, time's up!",
        "Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?",
        "Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in…vegetables, Joey?",
        "Does South Oregon have a sports-team? (Joey strikes one from his list) There you go.",
        "Oooh that may be a New World's record (Looks at his watch and picks up Ross' pad)",
        "Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states. (Smiles and hands Ross back his pad)",
        "I am only one man! (Monica heads out) Okay Ross, time is up!",
        "Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.",
        "Okay, but if you can't…no dinner!",
        "Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.",
        "I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.",
        "Which smells delicious!",
        "What?",
        "Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!",
        "Huh! Where is the dog?!",
        "Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!",
        "What is it doing here?",
        "Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!",
        "(gasping) Really?",
        "Well, it still has to go, right?",
        "Okay, it's um…",
        "(to Joey) I have to! Okay? It's time! (Joey shrugs as if to say, \"Do what you have to do\") Okay, I hate dogs.",
        "They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.",
        "(scared) Is there a puppy here?",
        "(to Tag) Okay, you are new!",
        "Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.",
        "And I don't wanna say this, I don't want you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. (An awkward silence ensues.) Oh my god!!",
        "(comes out of the bathroom) Here I am.",
        "How did you…know? (Heads back into the bathroom)",
        "(comes out of the bathroom) Where's Monica?",
        "Why not?",
        "Well, I, I should go in there.",
        "Why not?",
        "This is ridiculous. (He heads for Phoebe's bedroom)",
        "Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.",
        "Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?",
        "And that doesn't scare you? (He walks out)",
        "No, no he went for a walk.",
        "Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.",
        "Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y’know, for you, and…(Clears his throat) I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain. (Points up and then over to the street)",
        "Clunkers?! Oh my god!",
        "(to Clunkers) It is so good to see you!",
        "It's up to you.",
        "All right.",
        "You got it. (Starts looking at the pad, while Ross gets the turkey out of the fridge and starts to unwrap it) You got Nevada twice.",
        "Yeah. (Throws the pad on the table and heads for the bedroom)",
        "(looking up with her) That’s a plane!",
        "(with a quivering voice) No, I’m not!",
        "Because it’s flattering! (Shivers harder) Come on Monica! Come on Monica! (He goes inside.)",
        "(whispering) Monica!",
        "I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?",
        "Sorry, I just…can’t sleep. Ooh! (Turns on the light and Monica groans.) Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I’m like…(Fake snores.)",
        "What?! (Monica kicks him in the shin.) Ow! (He gets out of bed and heads into the living room.)",
        "Shhhhhhhhh!!! (Monica enters) I’m sorry, I thought maybe I’d make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.",
        "It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!",
        "Hey, y’know what we can do? Y’know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y’know like we did when we were first going out. It’d be fun!",
        "Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?",
        "(Pause) No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.",
        "That’s correct.",
        "(startled) What? What? What?",
        "Yeah! You?",
        "(intrigued) Yeah? (Monica nods yes.) I hope you’re not thinking about cleaning the living room.",
        "Do you know what just happened?",
        "No. We were in the middle of s*x…and you fell asleep.",
        "(turning the light back on) Monica?",
        "I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!",
        "Okay.",
        "Yeah! (Monica falls asleep) No! No! No! Don’t fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. (Monica doesn’t move as he gets out of bed and as he’s heading for the door.) And I probably won’t spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.",
        "Hm-hmm, I told you! (Looks at the clock) I can’t believe that I’ve only got two hours before I call in sick for work.",
        "Well, you’re not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes…",
        "Do you wanna?",
        "Ohh. Mmm.",
        "Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.",
        "(nervously) It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.",
        "I—no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.",
        "Because it's too delicious.",
        "No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, (Reading the label) Momma’s Little Bakery. (Pause) I feel terrible, I’m a horrible, horrible, horrible person.",
        "So…",
        "Oh, what’s at 8:00?",
        "Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie’s made some new friends.",
        "I used to undress my cousin Glenn. (Monica looks at him then shushes him.)",
        "Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!",
        "I can’t seem to say goodbye.",
        "Well I’ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!",
        "(closing the box) Y’know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.",
        "Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?",
        "Well, thank you for lunch.",
        "So apparently we just don’t pay for food anymore. (Rachel laughs then Chandler notices something.) Do you see what I see?",
        "Mrs. Braverman must be out. (They move closer to it.)",
        "By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don’t want her to come back to bad cheesecake.",
        "Well, we don’t want that.",
        "But we should take it.",
        "Why?",
        "Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! (Rachel grabs the cheesecake and they take off upstairs.)",
        "I’m full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I’ll regret it.",
        "What are you doing tonight?",
        "Dude! Dude! (Motions that Joey should pull up his pants.)",
        "Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.",
        "That’s what Monica said.",
        "Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!",
        "I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. (She tries to whistle and blows little chunks of cheesecake out of her mouth.) How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!",
        "Y’know what? I don’t trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and I’m takin’ it back! (Grabs the cheesecake and heads for his apartment.)",
        "Oh yes!",
        "Oh yes!",
        "Oh yes! Oh yes!",
        "Well that’s not fair, you’ve already had some!",
        "What do we use to split it?",
        "(examining the cake) Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh… There’s more crust on this side. Y’know? So, maybe if I measured…",
        "All right, I’ll pick that one. (Points.)",
        "(gloatingly and holding his piece) Ohhh!",
        "Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don’t come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my… (Rachel knocks the plate from his hand and it falls on the floor. That process leaves just the forkful Chandler has, Rachel starts to go after that little bit and Chandler retreats into his apartment.)",
        "Stick to your side!",
        "Couldn’t I just say, \"This is Ross?\"",
        "(knocking on the window while outside) Sorry! (Runs off.)",
        "Joey! Joe! (Sees that he’s not here and starts investigating. He picks up the bag of chips.) Full bag. (He picks up the beer.) Beer’s still cold. Something terrible must’ve happened here! (He decides it’s not that important; sits down on Rosita, and the back falls off causing him to flip over.) Oh no-no-no-no-no-no! (Runs over to Stevie.) Stevie, I was never here! (Runs out.)",
        "My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita! (He runs out the door, grabs the back of Rosita, and we can hear Joey and Rachel talking as they are coming up the stairs. Neither of them have reached the landing yet.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah, I’d love to but I’ve tried that so many times they won’t even let me in the store anymore.",
        "(excitedly) Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?",
        "That’s awesome! That’s great! What made you do it?!",
        "Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey’s chair?",
        "I thought I broke Joey’s chair! That’s why I replaced it with mine!",
        "Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?",
        "I’m gettin’ my chair back! (Heads for Joey and Rachel’s.)",
        "Joey you broke my chair!!",
        "I think I should get the chair!",
        "Because you (Points to Joey) broke a chair and you (Points to Rachel) broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn’t broke a chair, is me!",
        "Well, where’s the logic in that?!",
        "So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!",
        "What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!",
        "(To Monica) She’s not as pretty as she was when she was 29.",
        "No Rach, it’s not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn’t that much fun.",
        "Ross, a sports car? Wouldn’t it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?",
        "(To Joey) Would you put that back on?! Monica’s gonna be here any minute!",
        "(frustrated) Okay, for the last time. It’s not named for each individual man.",
        "Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can’t believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! (To Mr. Geller) And you! I can’t believe that you would have a tux that’s thirty years old! (Puts his hand on Mr. Geller’s shoulder.)",
        "Ohh! (He quickly removes his hand and looks at it.)",
        "Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down! (Rachel turns off the lights and everyone crouches. As everyone crouches, a ripping noise erupts from the assemblage.)",
        "(getting up to investigate) Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out what’s going on.",
        "Hey-hey are you drunk?",
        "Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!",
        "Yes!",
        "Yes!!",
        "Okay, here’s the thing. We’re gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you’re drunk.",
        "Yeah, I’ll take care of it.",
        "(laughing) Okay we have to do something about your breath.",
        "That’s still yours. Okay, now remember it’s a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.",
        "See? (Does his laugh.) Here we go. (Starts walking her to their room, and has to pass in front of Mr. Geller who’s sitting at the table and Mrs. Geller who’s standing next to him.)",
        "(correcting her) Phil.",
        "Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. (Monica stumbles on the steps.) Okay, (catches her) you’re doing great. You’re doing great. You’re doing fine.",
        "Monica’s a little drunk.",
        "(To Monica) Go change! (To Phoebe) She doesn’t want her parents to know she’s drunk.",
        "Monica’s wasted.",
        "(To Rachel) Okay, will you just go help her change please!",
        "Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!",
        "For my last birthday you gave me a hug! (To Rachel) Okay, read the card! Read the card!",
        "No-no-no-no! That was the joke!",
        "No, because you’re not a grandmother!",
        "(to a waiter) Oh that’s great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? (The waiter comes over) There we go.",
        "(To Monica) How are you feeling?",
        "(To Monica) Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don’t talk to anyone.",
        "Pheebs!!",
        "I think it’s necessary. (Backs away anyhow.)",
        "What?",
        "Okay, here we go.",
        "Hey! How’d it go?",
        "Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.",
        "(To Ross) Monica said wedding.",
        "Do you think you could get through a poem?",
        "Too?",
        "Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking. (Winks in a spy-type manner.)",
        "That’s great!",
        "So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!",
        "Don’t do it.",
        "I think it’s the dying cat parade.",
        "(turning around and looking) Oh my God!",
        "Y’know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, \"You’re half Scottish right?\"",
        "Yes!!",
        "Why is your family Ross?!",
        "If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.",
        "Well, I feel like a snack!",
        "Oh no thanks. I don’t like anything from my Scottish heritage.",
        "Well it’s just my entire family was run out of Scotland by…Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories. (Makes a few unintelligible noises.)",
        "We heard you play all the way from your apartment!",
        "That’s not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don’t feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.",
        "Because we hate them.",
        "We have heard you play.",
        "No!",
        "You mean the spitter?",
        "Easy for you to say; you’ll be wearing a veil.",
        "You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?",
        "Sorry, I just don’t like the idea of when I say \"I do,\" he’s thinking, \"Yeah, I’d do her too!\"",
        "Yeah!",
        "Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.",
        "We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!",
        "No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.",
        "Joe…",
        "(To Monica) Y’know, we haven’t found anybody else.",
        "Yeah you can do it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey!",
        "Our minister…",
        "Okay.",
        "(To Monica) Should we call the spitter?",
        "Yeah. O-okay.",
        "See Joe, not that that’s not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y’know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!",
        "No, not us… (Motions Joey and him.) Us! (Motions Monica and him.)",
        "See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y’know, romantic stories. Nice stories.",
        "Joe?",
        "Isn’t that what happened with you and the bridesmaid?",
        "And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.",
        "But then later that night…",
        "(answering the door) Hey!",
        "Well I was… I wasn't exactly expecting company after…(He looks at his watch.) 9:15.",
        "Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bridesmaid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you’re not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?",
        "Well, look it’s been a really emotional time y’know, and you’ve had a lot to drink. And you’ve just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!",
        "You kidding? You’re the most beautiful woman in most rooms… (She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What’s going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?",
        "But we don’t do that.",
        "How drunk are you?",
        "(thinks) That’s the perfect amount!",
        "What?",
        "I know.",
        "Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wanna get under the covers?",
        "Okay!",
        "It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.",
        "Yep!",
        "Count of three?",
        "Two!",
        "Three! (They lift up the covers and check each other out, then come back up with silly grins on their faces.)",
        "Well I think it’s safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.",
        "Eh!",
        "Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey! (Monica hides under the covers as Joey enters. Remember?)",
        "Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e… (Notices that the TV is turned off.)",
        "No! No! No!",
        "They’re in my bag over there. (Points.)",
        "Uh, could you leave me one?",
        "Yeah.",
        "No I-I-I’m fine.",
        "What?",
        "Who did you originally want to hook up with?",
        "(To Monica) So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?",
        "Oh, it’s not important? It’s not important?! If it wasn’t for a bridesmaid you’d be marrying him (Points to Joey) not me!",
        "I don’t believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I’m runner up.",
        "(To Joey) Look there is no way you’re doing this wedding now. Okay?",
        "Okay, it’s just weird! Okay? I don’t want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need…I don’t know what I need. I need a walk.",
        "It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin. (Walks out and slams the door.)",
        "Hey. Do you want this scone? (Holds up his plate) It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!",
        "Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding…",
        "How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!",
        "That’s what you should say.",
        "When you’re marrying us; that’s what you should say.",
        "I’d love it if you would do it.",
        "But those are the words! Those exact words!",
        "Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.",
        "This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.",
        "Y’know I think we should invite them.",
        "Well this is just sad!",
        "Well, thanks a lot for hookin’ me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.",
        "(sees another rack) Well, what’s the deal with these? These-these look nice.",
        "You mean like for award shows?",
        "You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, \"Who are you wearing?! You look fabulous!\"",
        "Okay, who wore those? (Points to the tuxedos.)",
        "Not bad.",
        "Who’s that?",
        "Pierce Brosnan?",
        "Are you serious?",
        "007?! This is James Bond’s tux?!",
        "Oh, I have to get married in James Bond’s tux!",
        "Oh, it’s not just that, I would be England’s most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty’s secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. (Worried.) Would Monica let me wear this?",
        "A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?",
        "What?",
        "You can’t wear that! I’m wearing the famous tux! James Bond’s tux!",
        "So—If you wear that you’ll make mine less special.",
        "Please, don’t take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!",
        "Look, it’s my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.",
        "That was pretty 007.",
        "Ross is Batman!",
        "Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!",
        "Batman has a utility belt!",
        "Batman has the Batmobile!",
        "Batman has Robin! (Pause) We get ESPN right?",
        "Actually, I don’t like martinis.",
        "Ooh, yum! (Runs into the bedroom.)",
        "I would but mine doesn’t fit. The pants are a little tight.",
        "Well, does that mean that you’re not going to be wearing yours?",
        "(standing up) Let me try it on!",
        "(trying on the jacket) Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! (Finds something in the pocket) What’s this?",
        "An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn’t wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!",
        "The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell. (Hands him the jacket and walks away.)",
        "Well, you’re welcome. And tell them we’re really glad they’re coming.",
        "(yelling from the changing room) All right! I found one that fits!",
        "Whose is it?",
        "Whose is it?",
        "Oh, come on! I don’t care! Come on! Whose is it?",
        "So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we’re trying to get to play at the wedding?",
        "Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!",
        "Gap commercial. (To Monica) So did you book them? Did you call?",
        "Do you want me to call?",
        "Staying out of the way.",
        "Sure! That’s one of the great things about being engaged. I’m not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.",
        "(To Ross) Smooth.",
        "So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?",
        "Huh.",
        "Hey!",
        "Uh Joe, when it’s one o’clock in the morning and you don’t come by? That’s okay!",
        "Really? Right across the street?",
        "When’d you meet her?",
        "Excellent! Y’know Ross met somebody too!",
        "Hi! How’d it go?",
        "(sarcastically shocked) Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross’s situation?",
        "So this is nice! I wish I didn’t have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. (He gets up and Joey moves over next to Ross.) Oh uh, by the way, what’s the name of the girl you’re dating?",
        "Bye! (Exits.)",
        "Joey got meat sauce on the banister again! (He goes into the bathroom to wash his hands.)",
        "(returning) What are you guys talking about?",
        "But I love swing music!",
        "Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there’s another reason too.",
        "I don’t want to say.",
        "Well it’s just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was…the first time I knew that…you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.",
        "Hi, honey! I’m home!",
        "Why? Do you have another boyfriend in there or something?",
        "Y’know it’s funny I started it but, now it’s scaring me. So could you come out here please?",
        "Oh you got a wedding dress? That’s great!",
        "Well then why can’t I see it?",
        "Okay I promise. I’ll-I’ll hate it. (She enters.) Wow! You-you look…hideous.",
        "Yeah, that’s like the most ugliest dress I’ve ever seen. Wh-why do you have to return it?",
        "Oh that’s great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it’s like yuck! It’s terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!",
        "Okay!",
        "(without turning around) I thought you were gonna be gone all day.",
        "Oh totally! (Holds up his finger.) Pull my finger.",
        "Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big",
        "Kinda. They’re really big.",
        "What?",
        "No. No, see when I first meet somebody it’s uh it’s mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.",
        "Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I’m afraid even more sweating.",
        "I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. (Monica laughs.) Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.",
        "Well yeah! But now that I know that you’re having these thoughts, I’m back to panic, anxiety, and uh I’m definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.",
        "(hoarsely) Water! Water! Water!",
        "Hey!",
        "Y’know I’m-I’m really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.",
        "Y’know I was thinking if we had a…a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours…",
        "Technically we could have s*x again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!",
        "That’s me! Come on!",
        "Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.",
        "(transfixed) Hi! Nice to meet you!",
        "I’ll be right with you.",
        "I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It’s called being a good conversationalist. Watch. (Stares at Monica’s eyes.) Say something.",
        "Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?",
        "Do you realize you get louder each week?",
        "I figured I’d buy those. Pat, I’d like to buy a vow. (Laughs)",
        "Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?",
        "Do you happen to know what I’m going to say?",
        "(watching in her) (in his head) Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What’s wrong with me? Ooh, don’t open that door.",
        "(writing) Monica, there are no words… (To Joey and Ross) There are no words! This should not be this hard!",
        "I’m so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should’ve seen her. Writing, writing, writing!",
        "Yeah, I’m not sure I can do that.",
        "(seeing her) Okay.",
        "All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?",
        "(shocked) There are seven?! (Points to one) That’s one?",
        "Oh, y’know-y’know what, I was looking at it upside down.",
        "(writing) Monica…",
        "(writes what Joey said and waits for him to go on) Yeah?",
        "You'll get one.",
        "All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?",
        "Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.",
        "No, no, no.",
        "(trapped) Uh, uh.",
        "Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back of the chair he was sitting in)",
        "Nice try.",
        "Look, Monica…",
        "This is not going to work.",
        "You are so great! I love you!",
        "Nothing! I said, I said \"You're so great\" and then I just, I just stopped talking!",
        "No I didn't!",
        "No I didn't!",
        "No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!",
        " Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?",
        "Well, what if all my stuff was here?",
        "Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying?",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! I'll do it!  Oh God, I thought… (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cry again.) And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you marry me?",
        "I've had a very long, hard day.",
        "Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.",
        "Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.",
        "Hey Joe!",
        "Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some coleslaw, some beans, and a Coke—(Yelps in pain as Monica grabs him underwater)—Diet Coke.",
        "It happened in London.",
        "The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.",
        "No-no-no-no-no! You can't!",
        "(on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)",
        "(after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!",
        "Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?",
        "Phoebe knows about us!",
        "Ahh yes, the messers become the messees!",
        "Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!",
        "Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little mimic of her dance.)",
        "Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?",
        "Oh, you're-you're going?",
        "(swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy we're gonna have all the s*x.",
        "Not if I kiss you first.",
        "Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.",
        "Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have s*x with ya!",
        "Because I'm in love with Monica!!",
        "Love her! That's right, I…LOVE…HER!!! I love her!! (They walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica.",
        "Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.",
        "Who are those people?",
        "What’s going on?",
        "So we both finished our vows.",
        "Don’t worry honey, we’ll make yours funnier.",
        "Okay, what do you guys think?",
        "You really like it?",
        "I stole Monica’s and changed the name.",
        "Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that’s because I didn’t send him an invitation.",
        "I don’t even know the man. Okay? We’re not that close. I haven’t seen him in years.",
        "Well he doesn’t have to know! It’s not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.",
        "Trust me, you don’t want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.",
        "What’s this?",
        "Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers—Think of the money we’ll save!! (Monica just looks at him.) We’re not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?",
        "Y’know we already went over this and I won!",
        "Look forget it okay? I don’t want to go. I don’t want to see him. I don’t wanna.",
        "No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you’d have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y’know it’s hard enough to be fourteen. You’re skinny. You’re wearing speedos—That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there’s your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. He was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!",
        "He had s*x with Mr. Garibaldi!",
        "Does it matter?!",
        "Yeah o-okay, but I’m just doing this for you.",
        "So I really never get to win anymore?",
        "Yeah, I just ordered a beer! (Pounds the table.)",
        "No! No! I don’t want him to know we’re here yet! I’m not sure I’m ready for that. And besides, he’s not gonna be too happy to see me either.",
        "I don’t know if I’ve told you this, but he’s kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years",
        "Yeah, he’s made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y’know it’s all very Cats in the Cradle—I don’t want to get into it. (The show starts.) Here we go.",
        "And there’s daddy!",
        "Believe me, I’ve been saying that for years. Oh my God!",
        "That’s Mr. Garibaldi playing the piano.",
        "He’s coming into the audience. He’s coming into the audience.",
        "It can’t happen like this. Okay? I’ll meet you back at the hotel.",
        "(resigning himself to his fate) Chandler. (He quickly sits down.)",
        "Oh, they’re a hoot.",
        "Actually Monica and I are engaged.",
        "Wait! Wait! We’d really love it if you could be there.",
        "I know it would make me happy, ma’am.",
        "Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.",
        "(To Monica) When I was growing up I…played the one on the far left.",
        "Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the mrs. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.",
        "The young hot ball and chain.",
        "What’s up?",
        "Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I’m buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.",
        "But you’re still my friend?",
        "During this time…are you, are you still my best man?",
        "Do I still call you Ross?",
        "(smiling) Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.",
        "So are we…friends again?",
        "Okay. (Pause) You won’t believe what Monica’s older brother just said to me!",
        "(entering from the bedroom) Okay. Here’s a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.",
        "Yes, include more people in this.",
        "Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.",
        "Well you don’t have to sound so surprised.",
        "What?",
        "Honestly? Me too.",
        "Yeah. Y’know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and I’ll go all…Chandler. But nothing has.",
        "Okay. I’ll be right there.",
        "We’re the Bings.",
        "Mr. and Mrs. Bing! (Walks away.)",
        "Hi.",
        "Mom. Thanks for wearing something. (They hug.) (She’s wearing a tight dress with a lot of cleavage showing.)",
        "Hi…dad.",
        "Oh my God! (He and Monica walk away.)",
        "How did you guys find me? I knew I should’ve hid at the gym!",
        "Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I’m related to Monica. How is she?",
        "No! No! No! I can’t do that!",
        "Because if I go home, we’re gonna become the Bings! I can’t be the Bings!",
        "The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!",
        "No.",
        "It’s not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybody’s! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And I’ve met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don’t race cars! I don’t make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.",
        "I want to. I love her so much, but I’m afr…It’s too huge.",
        "Well yeah, but then…",
        "Depends on what you mean by we.",
        "No.",
        "Yeah okay. Well, what’s the next little bit?",
        "Yeah. You’re right. Hey I-I can do that.",
        "Okay, excuse me for a minute. (Starts to leave)",
        "Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh fresh air!",
        "What?",
        "Ross! (He starts to get up.)",
        "(standing up) That’s right! I’m not!",
        "I know about Monica.",
        "Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.",
        "You don’t know?",
        "Monica’s pregnant.",
        "Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes…",
        "Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and that’s when I uh, saw this. (He holds up a little, tiny baby jumper that reads I (heart) New York.) Yeah, y’know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can’t be scary.",
        "But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so she’d know I was okay.",
        "You look beautiful mom. (His dad clears his throat.) You look beautiful too dad. I love you both. (He kisses his dad on the cheek) I’m so glad you're here. (He kisses his mom.)",
        "Are you Joey?",
        "You look beautiful. Is this new? (Her dress.)",
        "Okay.",
        "(in Monica’s ear) He’s Greek Orthodox.",
        "(To Ross) No, that’s okay. (Ross nods and retreats.) Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way, it’s okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I’m sure? (He leans in and kisses her.)",
        "I do.",
        "(To Monica) I love you. And I know about the baby.",
        "Our baby.",
        "Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.",
        "Then…who did?",
        "What?! What are you talking about?",
        "Who’s the father?",
        "Why not?",
        "As in Barbara Streisand’s husband James Brolin?",
        "Y’know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.",
        "Before we go out there I’ve got a present for ya.",
        "No?",
        "I’ve been taking dancing lessons.",
        "Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget.",
        "So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?",
        "I don’t know, it’s these new shoes, they’re all slippery.",
        "Not well.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.",
        "Funny: ha-ha or funny: (Mimes blowing his brain out.)",
        "What size shoes do you wear?",
        "Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?",
        "(looking at Joey’s feet) Those aren’t eleven and a half.",
        "And the world will never know.",
        "Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.",
        "But you’re not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.",
        "Did it turn into sand?",
        "(sliding up behind her) No. No, I won’t. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didn’t want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.",
        "Why?",
        "(to the front desk clerk) Hi! We’re checking out of the bridal suite.",
        "And I’m the happiest guy in the world! (Monica goes and sits down in a huff.) Oh honey, come on don’t be upset. We still have so much to look forward to!",
        "We got the honeymoon.",
        "The wedding pictures?",
        "Not the disposable cameras from the tables.",
        "I’ll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home.",
        "What? What did you take a picture of?",
        "Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?",
        "Oh.",
        "Okay, well I’m gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them developed. (Joey laughs again.) 32 Joe. You’re 32! (Exits)",
        "Hey. (He sees that Ross is packing all of the hotel toiletries) Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?",
        "Yeah but you don’t need—(Picks up something)—What is this?",
        "Score! Where are the disposable cameras?",
        "The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?",
        "Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said…",
        "So you don’t have the cameras?!",
        "So? What? What? They’re gone! Monica’s gonna freak!",
        "Great.",
        "Hey! Did you find the cameras?",
        "Yes! And that’s why I’m under the table. Celebrating.",
        "Well this is great. Y’know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, she’s really depressed.",
        "All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can’t believe I screwed this up!",
        "Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?",
        "Are you serious?",
        "Marriage advice? Really?!",
        "I don’t know, Monica picked out the flowers.",
        "She picked those out too.",
        "That was her.",
        "I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?",
        "(to another couple) Uh, excuse me? Could you take a picture of us?",
        "Uhh… Yeah sure. (Holds the camera up to his face.) Click!",
        "Oh yeah. I’ll take, I’ll take your picture. (He takes the picture with his finger over the lens.)",
        "Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here!",
        "Why don’t you go up on stage. I’ll get a picture of you doing the speech.",
        "Okay, you ready for the last picture?",
        "Get ready to run. (Chandler walks over to the new bride.) Congratulations on your wedding. (He grabs her, kisses her, Ross takes the picture, and they both run out.)",
        "We’re back!",
        "It’s picture time.",
        "(showing her the pictures) Here’s a picture of Ross. (Shows another one.) And that’s me. (Another one.) And that’s me and Ross. (Another one.) Oh-ho, that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple.",
        "Eh?",
        "Okay, so this isn’t a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss with…with this lady. Which by the look on your face I’m sure you’ll remember. So we don’t need—(Rips the picture)—There’s no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now.",
        "Okay. (Sees the living room.) You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together!",
        "Call it even?!",
        "Hey! Babe! Aren’t you excited we’re going on our honeymoon?",
        "(singing) Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama…",
        "I’d better go pack.",
        "A Speedo? Uh, I don’t have a Speedo. I’m gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit. (Goes into the bedroom.)",
        "(entering) Hey, what was that all about?",
        "(in a high pitched voice) What?! I didn’t even know that—Why didn’t you tell me?! (Pause) Why am I talking like this?!",
        "(in the high pitched voice) What?! (Normal voice) I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets.",
        "Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper.",
        "You already know.",
        "Oh honey, leave them alone, they’re in love.",
        "We are on our honeymoon.",
        "25J and K, any chance those aren’t together?",
        "No.",
        "Just act like you belong.",
        "Shh! (To the guy behind the counter) Nice to see you again. (They tries to walk past him.)",
        "Yes, of course. (Shows him the tickets.)",
        "Oh that’s all right, I have it memorized. It’s 1A.",
        "Apology accepted. Excuse us. (They try to enter again.)",
        "Oh you’ve got to be kidding me.",
        "We’re you just ten seconds later!",
        "(looks at Monica then at them) We need the stuff.",
        "What else is new?",
        "You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet p0rn?",
        "What’s funny about that?",
        "Hey that’s okay. So, where do you want to go?",
        "The Hard Rock Café?",
        "Again?!",
        "You like the Purple Rain display! (A guy walks up.) Hey Bob.",
        "Yeah, he thinks that’s my name.",
        "Oh it’s been going on way to long now. Y’know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn’t say anything. And then the next time he said, \"Hey Toby, do you want a donut?\" And I-I wanted a donut. And now it’s five years later, the donut’s gone and I’m still Toby.",
        "No! That would be so awkward! Look—Besides, we work in different departments. He’s on the sixth floor y’know? So he calls me Toby once in a while. What’s the big deal? It could be worse, it’s not like he’s calling me Muriel. (Chandler suddenly freezes into place.)",
        "Shh! It is a family name!",
        "Hey Bob.",
        "If I see him, I’ll ask.",
        "Yeah!",
        "We’re on a semi-first name basis.",
        "Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don’t know if he has what it takes.",
        "But this is eleven. It’s almost twice as hard up here.",
        "I think it’s best sir.",
        "Y’know what you should do, just toss ‘em in the shedder and claim you never got ‘em.",
        "What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!",
        "Sure, what’s up?",
        "Hey Bobby.",
        "Uhh yeah. Yeah, it’s (Points down the hall) right, right down there. (When he has Bob looking down the hall, he turns around and knocks his nameplate off of his door.) Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?",
        "Okay Bob listen uhh, I’m the reason you didn’t get the job up here.",
        "Bob!",
        "Well that puts me in a difficult position.",
        "(entering) Bob. Bob! Bob!!! (He turns around) What the hell are you doing?!",
        "Her what?!!",
        "You had a bachelorette party?!",
        "I thought we weren’t gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! Y’know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.",
        "You went home with the waitress.",
        "I can’t believe you didn’t tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!",
        "My God! You must be good in bed!",
        "She’s okay with Rachel and the baby?",
        "Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that you’re going down the same path, but you’re really going down different ones.",
        "What?",
        "Honey! That’s crazy! I don’t want you to get me a stripper…",
        "Look, I appreciate it, but uh, it’s a little creepy. Y’know? I’m not a bachelor anymore.",
        "All right fine! But I’m only doing this for you!",
        "And Joey.",
        "Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.",
        "I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Okay. I can’t believe tomorrow’s the big day.",
        "You’re right, this is more fun.",
        "Hi. (Joey blows on a noisemaker.)",
        "That’s me.",
        "Yeah, yeah right over there.",
        "That was weird.",
        "So she’s a…",
        "I can’t believe there is a naked hooker in there!",
        "Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it. (Walks towards the bedroom.) Ma’am, are you also a stripper?",
        "That is funny, maybe for my birthday she’ll murder someone.",
        "Oh actually, I’d rather you…Yeah, go ahead. We’re gonna have to burn that room down anyway.",
        "Why would she do that?",
        "This is the worst bachelor party ever!",
        "(To Joey) In a minute? What’s gonna happen in a minute?!",
        "Why me?!",
        "Which is why you should do it.",
        "You do it!",
        "All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave! (Joey smirks.) What?",
        "I don’t think we’ve actually done this before!",
        "Well we…we still hang out.",
        "Well y’know, things are different. I’m…I’m married now.",
        "Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on we’ll make time to hang out with each other.",
        "Her ass print is still on your grandmother’s quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?",
        "Monica! Wait!",
        "(puts on his crown) Carry on.",
        "Could you not narrate?",
        "You’re an actor!",
        "(entering from the bedroom wearing a big, pink bunny costume) Monica! Can I talk to you for a second? Listen, I appreciate you getting me the costume…",
        "The Velveteen Rabbit was brown and white!",
        "No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!!",
        "How is that me?",
        "When have I ever done that?!",
        "Wow! I don’t have the worst costume anymore!",
        "Oh! Hi!",
        "Joey’s gonna be thrilled! He was hoping you’d come by as a slutty nurse.",
        "You’d think that would embarrass me, but you see I’m maxed out.",
        "(To Ross) Marry her.",
        "Howdy doody.",
        "Oh relax man, relax. You’re looking a little flushed.",
        "What question?",
        "There’s no question.",
        "(To Monica) You picked Ross?!",
        "I cannot believe you didn’t pick me.",
        "Oh really?! You think you’re stronger? Why don’t you prove it? (He pushes Ross who starts to fall backwards until Mona catches him.)",
        "(To Ross) You’re going down.",
        "That means nothing to me. (To Ross) Come on!",
        "And dignity.",
        "Nope! I can do this all day.",
        "God, I’m exhausted.",
        "No way! If anything you’ve gotta let me win! My wife thinks I’m a wimp!",
        "You’re Spudnik.",
        "Fine. (He lets Ross win.) Oh no!",
        "Listen, I’ve got a secret for ya. I let him win.",
        "No, I let him win—Ross!",
        "Would you tell her I let you win please?",
        "I am strong! I’ll show you! (He sits down at the table.)",
        "Oh what’s the matter? Are you scared?",
        "Okay. 1…2…3—Go! (Once again he’s at a stalemate, but this time he’s in pain.) (Pause) I’m gonna kill myself!",
        "Hey.",
        "Y’know uh, I didn’t actually do this.",
        "No, it wasn’t you.",
        "I got a maid. Yay!",
        "Uh honey, I know you don’t like to relinquish control…",
        "Look, she’s really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.",
        "Yes, I distinctly remember ‘cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance, okay?",
        "What’s the matter?",
        "See? I told you.",
        "(pause) What?",
        "So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?",
        "She must’ve been planning this for years!",
        "Honey, isn’t it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?",
        "So, shouldn’t we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go…snooping around her crotch?",
        "Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?",
        "(entering) Hi!",
        "How come?",
        "To see her pants?",
        "Are you sure? Did you see the stain?",
        "God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?",
        "Oh dear God!",
        "And yet you don’t recognize that you’re crazy.",
        "Here’s another plan…No!",
        "Why?",
        "I fear a jury will see it the same way!",
        "You see that?",
        "All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it’s not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!",
        "You need new clothes.",
        "I’m leaning. This is where I lean.",
        "Brenda a bee!",
        "Yes! It’s flown into your blouse and you’d better undo your buttons lest it sting you!",
        "You do?",
        "I totally understand. (They both laugh.) Can I just see your bra?",
        "New haircut? (Monica nods ‘No.’) Necklace? (No) Dress? (No) Boots? (Monica nods ‘Yes.’) Boots!",
        "Oh my God!",
        "I’m gonna miss being able to afford food.",
        "She had a point. (Shows her the receipt.)",
        "Yeah well, too bad we’re gonna have to return them.",
        "I have you.",
        "Hey-hey.",
        "You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them. (Goes and gets some coffee at the counter.)",
        "(returning to his seat) Hey!",
        "(spinning around looking for him) I don’t think you did a very thorough job!",
        "(opening the door) What’s wrong?",
        "Oh don’t forget, my office holiday party is tonight. (They go into the apartment.)",
        "Now sweetie, I know you don’t like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a…supple leather lining.",
        "Why not?",
        "Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?",
        "You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!",
        "Okay.",
        "Y’know, that party wasn’t bad.",
        "I don’t see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?",
        "What honey, it’s like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let’s go.",
        "What’s going on?",
        "What?",
        "So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right. (Pause) It’s oddly unsettling.",
        "Hop on.",
        "Honey, I know you’re in pain right now, but I’m a little turned on.",
        "Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.",
        "Oh I’m sorry! Do you need a break?",
        "I can see it from right here. It’ll cost you one husband.",
        "(pause) I don’t have your boots.",
        "Well, why don’t you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!",
        "Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?",
        "Y’know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.",
        "Okay. (Moves closer to the window.)",
        "I have no idea.",
        "Yeah! I’m just pretending to watch the game so I don’t have to help out with stuff.",
        "Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.",
        "Yeah! Anderson just scored again! (To Phoebe) There’s no Anderson.",
        "Oh hey. I’d shake your hand but uh; I’m really into the game. Plus, I think it’d be better for my ego if we didn’t stand right next to each other.",
        "I’m watching the game, but I’m not deaf!",
        "(To Phoebe) Y’know, it’s been a while since we’ve screamed something. Maybe we should.",
        "Oh come on!",
        "Good game!",
        "Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.",
        "(simultaneously) Detroit.",
        "Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?!",
        "I’m sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?",
        "Did she look 16?",
        "Well, she probably wasn’t familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!",
        "Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.",
        "Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?",
        "I didn’t know you and Carol were getting divorced, I’m sorry.",
        "No.",
        "Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesn’t it?",
        "Oh uh, as it turns out, we can’t do it. Monica has to work.",
        "Oh uh well tomorrow’s no good for her either.",
        "It’s the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament.",
        "Well now-now you’re just talking crazy.",
        "Because uh…we-we…we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.",
        "Y’know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?",
        "Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. (Doug looks at him.) But to hell with that bitch.",
        "Oh that’s all right sir, and that’s just one girl.",
        "It’s a hand. It’s a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.",
        "Oh no-no-no!",
        "Hi honey I’m home.",
        "It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldn’t give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!",
        "Y’know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like It’s a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives.",
        "Ooh, I don’t know if we’re there yet.",
        "Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?",
        "Pheebs you didn’t have to get us anything for our wedding you already sang…",
        "Oh, okay.",
        "I kinda like it here.",
        "Well what did it do?",
        "A vending machine?",
        "Who cares? It’s a stupid game.",
        "I don’t suck. It’s sucks. You suck.",
        "Why do you want to play this game so bad?",
        "You are not going to believe what I did today!",
        "I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler. (Pause) Although I-I hope they don’t.",
        "Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the board! High five! (Holds up his hand to give Monica a high five, only he can’t straighten his fingers.)",
        "Well I’ve been playing it for like eight hours, it’ll loosen up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, they’re dirty words.",
        "Because it’s awesome.",
        "Well y’know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge.",
        "It is when you put it together with that one.",
        "Come on, he won’t even know what they mean.",
        "Have you talked to him lately?",
        "No-no-no, if you unplug it, I’ll have nothing to show for my day! It would be like I was at work. (She unplugs it.) No! (And plugs it back in.) Hey look at that! Look at that, it’s still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM (Read Only Memory, it’s a memory chip.) Chip in it or something!",
        "With the claw?!",
        "(smiles) Pull my finger—(Looks at his hand)—My hand is messed up.",
        "I did. (Looks at his still deformed hand) But it came at a price.",
        "Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies. (They both look at him.) Was it just me?!",
        "One more score to go! You can do it! (Touches her shoulder.)",
        "All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!",
        "Are you, are you high?",
        "Really? I don’t like baths.",
        "Honey, it’s not the bath I enjoy, it’s the wet, naked lady.",
        "Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.",
        "Honey, it’s 2:00 on a Wednesday and I’m watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?",
        "Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?",
        "Oh my God, what’s up?!",
        "Oh no-no, no you don’t, just come back.",
        "Do you?",
        "In London?",
        "Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.",
        "If that.",
        "Hey.",
        "s*x on the balcony?",
        "What is it?",
        "Honey, I don’t like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having s*x on the balcony?",
        "Well, this does butch it up a bit.",
        "All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss s*x on the balcony?",
        "(thinking) All right, this isn’t so bad. I like the flower smell! Which is okay, because I’ve got my boat.",
        "Oh my God.",
        "I’m going to need a bigger boat.",
        "I’m in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think there’s something wrong.",
        "I’m in the bathtub.",
        "I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The water’s tepid. The salt didn’t dissolve and is now… lodged places. And the scents I used don’t compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile—Oh!",
        "The bath salts! They’re starting to effervesce! It’s different. (Pause) It’s interesting.",
        "Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!",
        "I had the exact same conversation.",
        "I don’t know! Joey hasn’t had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth!",
        "All right, let’s break this down. What exactly did he say to you?",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "He didn’t say anything about that to me.",
        "He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.",
        "But what did he mean by rules?",
        "Because he was looking at her differently.",
        "My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!",
        "You don’t say anything.",
        "I’m not going to let you say anything.",
        "Oh, God!",
        "Do I smell essential oils?",
        "Okay.",
        "L-leaving my troubles behind?",
        "Oh, it’s so hard to care when you’re this relaxed.",
        "(upset) Hey!",
        "(To Monica) You told her?!",
        "(sarcastically) Because it’s a relaxing and enjoyable time!",
        "You like Rachel?!",
        "(sarcastically) Yes we’re all in here and we would love for you to join us!",
        "I’ll…I’ll get you later!",
        "Yeah. And what you’re doing feels so good.",
        "You’re not?",
        "Oh, sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!",
        "Hey Pheebs, what’s up?",
        "Buy stamps, pick up dry cleaning…Don’t let Phoebe in.",
        "Well, Phoebe I thought I’d—(Off Phoebe’s look)—Yeah, what the hell. (Exits with Phoebe.)",
        "Hey babe.",
        "Who says you can’t get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? Maybe we can take it back?",
        "How about to the street say from the balcony?",
        "Okay. How about in that cabinet?",
        "How about the closet by the bathroom? (The secret green door by the bathroom.)",
        "Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile. (Tries the door.) It’s locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?",
        "Oh y’know, I’ve been living here a while and I’ve never seen what’s inside that closet. What is, what is in there?",
        "Don’t try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!",
        "Fine.",
        "(walking casually away) Love you.",
        "Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years. (Phoebe rolls her eyes and walks away and Monica glares at him.) If! I said, \"If it helps!\" (Goes to the bedroom.)",
        "I wasn’t trying to open your closet! I wasn’t trying to open your closet! I swear! (Running into the kitchen and sees its Joey.)",
        "Monica has a secret closet and she won’t let me see what’s in it.",
        "I don’t know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can’t see?!",
        "Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?",
        "And here we go…",
        "There has got to be a way!",
        "Yeah. (Checks his hair.) Oh no wait, I’m not an nine-year-old girl.",
        "Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.",
        "So, how’s the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?",
        "That’s a good idea.",
        "Okay. (They switch places and Chandler gets out a credit card.) So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?",
        "Well, it’s not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to the hospital? Y’know? You’re doing nothing wrong. (Pause) Except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. (He loses his card behind the door.) Richard? If-if you’re in there, could you pass me my credit card?",
        "Not to shabby, I got this all off myself…using my wife’s tools. (He takes the door off the frame and we finally get to see what’s behind the green door! It is stacked, floor to ceiling, with junk.) Oh my God!",
        "(laughs) You’re messy.",
        "I married Fred Sanford!",
        "No, honey you’re not sick! Look, I don’t love you because you’re organized, I love you in spite of that.",
        "Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet.",
        "Hey.",
        "So Rachel’s all moved out huh? How are you taking it?",
        "Are you okay?",
        "Oh! (Puts his hand on her belly.) She’s growing inside you.",
        "Oh! (Pulls his hand away.)",
        "I think that’s the youngest girl ever to reject me.",
        "Oh hey!",
        "No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don’t think they exist.",
        "Why?",
        "What?",
        "Come on, don’t be crazy. (To Rachel) You don’t think there’s someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya? (Rachel looks at him.)",
        "A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!",
        "Luckily, the guy she settled for can’t hear what you’re talking about.",
        "You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you’re still gonna date him?",
        "(mouths to Phoebe) What?",
        "What’s wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? (Everyone stares at him.) On a barbecue chicken pizza? (Still there’s staring.) No?",
        "What are you doing?!",
        "I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!",
        "Cheese you say? That’s some pretty smelly work, huh Don?",
        "Cheese, it’s smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.",
        "Is it made of cheese?",
        "(disgusted) Oh come on! (To Phoebe) Are you listening to this?",
        "What do we do?",
        "Sure, why don’t you set it up. I’ll just be over here, browsing through the personals.",
        "Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.",
        "I’m sorry, did you say cheese?",
        "Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don’t believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won’t stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.",
        "No. But I’m sure (mimics Don) ‘tomatoes’ does.",
        "You don’t?",
        "So you…you don’t want to live with Don in a cheese house?",
        "I love you.",
        "Y’know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers . (Monica doesn’t look impressed.) No? Really? They taste so good.",
        "Hey!",
        "I don’t see him. (To Monica) Do you see him?",
        "What?! No! No!",
        "(incredulous) I don’t know what that’s like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, \"I love you,\" was, \"Oh crap!\"",
        "(interrupting him) We didn’t play it!!",
        "I didn’t know you read tea leaves.",
        "What does yours say Pheebs?",
        "Well, I’m sure you get another one at Ann Taylor’s.",
        "Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute! (Looking at his tea.) Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?",
        "I know it’s tough now, but things will get better.",
        "I’m not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?",
        "Let’s just say if I can’t find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one.",

        "Well, if we’re gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. Y’know alphabetically or by genre?",
        "They were just giving those away at the store (off Monica’s look) in exchange for money.",
        "Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack.",
        "What problem did you tell him you had?",

        "I love you, St. Valentine.",
        "Woah, woah, that’s not pretty!",
        "Worst p0rn ever! Worst p0rn ever! (Chandler starts to press buttons on the remote control, frantically.)",

        "You know, it haunts me? Up ‘til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!",
        "I can do that.",

        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?",
        "All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a bonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?",
        "Y’know what, we have to turn off the p0rn.",
        "All right, ready?",
        "Two.",
        "Yeah, that’s kinda a relief.",

        "Thanks.",
        "Well this one's for you.",
        "No, I can't. No-no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, (Puts bracelet on Joey) it's about you and me and the fact that we're (Reading bracelet) best buds.",
        "That's what they'll call us.",

        "(entering) Hey Phoebe! (To Rachel) Fatty!",
        "Well, I got a job interview. It’s kinda a big deal too. Its a lot more money and I’d be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.",
        "Me! I do that. So… Seriously, do I look okay? I’m little nervous.",
        "Why not?",
        "What about it?",
        "(shocked) What?!",
        "Are you serious?!",
        "What is it that I do?",
        "(To Rachel) Did you like me when we first met?",
        "I can’t even believe this! I really come off that badly?",

        "(really try not to laugh) Good to know.",
        "No don’t I beg of you!",
        "(relieved) Really?!",
        "Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Y’know I’ve been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing. (The interviewer doesn’t understand) Duties. (Still doesn’t.) Duties! (Still doesn’t.) Poo. (Still doesn’t.)",
        "Oh my God this doesn’t count! Okay? The interview was over, that was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! There’s a crazy guy out in the hall!",

        "Higher or lower than what?",

        "Let me see that.",
        "Triscadecaphobia.",
        "Fear of Triscuts?",
        "This game makes no sense!",
        "Oh come on Ross, I think we’re all losers here.",
        "Let me think. Let me think—Oh! I don’t care.",
        "Either, it makes no difference.",
        "I’ll take a card.",

        "He’s not snoozing, he’s teaching a class.",
        "I haven’t seen this dress.",
        "You really want to take me?",
        "So you’re never actually going to pay me back?",
        "I always knew you were gonna make it. I’m so proud of you.",
        "(in a manly voice) Yeah well, I’m gonna go spit. (He goes into the bedroom. On his way out, Joey gives Rachel a wide berth.)",
        "This is so exciting! It’s so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look?",
        "What?",
        "It’s just so glamorous.",
        "Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!",
        "Oh-ho-ho, yeah!",
        "The whole thing! Can we go?",
        "I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!",
        "I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.",

        "Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!",
        "I’m so sorry.",
        "What?!",
        "You don’t owe me anything, I don’t want you money…",
        "I don’t know, five hundred dollars?",
        "Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.",
        "Do you want a calculator?",
        "Here! (Hands him one. Joey adds it up and discovers that he was right.)",
        "Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes…",
        "Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican.",
        "Yes, money well spent!",
        "Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food…",
        "He pulled a quarter out of my ear!",
        "Okay. Wow.",
        "Sure.",
        "That was you?! I thought it was Jack!",
        "What?! Why does she think that?",
        "Again, what?!",
        "As we all are at some point during the day.",
        "Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?",
        "And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!",
        "Well, what did she say?",
        "Does Ross know?",
        "Well maybe you don’t have to tell him anything.",
        "If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!",
        "Honey, we’ve been over this. I need to be facing the other way.",
        "I’m so tired. (She starts kissing him.) Yeah okay, but no foreplay.",
        "Hello sir, you know Monica.",
        "Look, we can’t stay in here forever.",
        "This is okay. We’re all adults here; there’s nothing to be ashamed of. Now, let’s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. (They do so and find Mr. Geller leaning against a wall stunned.)",
        "I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn’t for fun.",
        "(To Monica) Why? Why-why-would you—Wh-why… (To Mr. Geller) Look, I just don’t want you to think that we’re animals who do it whenever we want.",
        "That’s funny, this conversation’s how I got the bullet hole in my head.",
        "Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.",
        "You still haven’t told Rachel you weren’t really proposing?",
        "Joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it look like?!",
        "Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.",
        "Okay, look, just do it gently.",
        "Hey.",
        "Hi!",
        "Man, if only you’d gotten here sooner. (Ross turns and glares at him.)",
        "Yeah?",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay. I’ve been thinking about it too, and I, I think we’re ready.",
        "But you said you were ready too.",
        "Yes, but haven’t you wanted a kid like forever?",
        "I’m not crazy about babies. I’m crazy about us.",
        "Look, we’ve always talked about having babies someday. I’m not saying it has to be right now, but I’m starting to think that we can handle it. We’re good. We’re really good.",
        "But nothing has to happen until your ready.",
        "What?! It’s not right! We’re not ready to have a kid now!!",
        "I’m kidding. This is going to be fun.",
        "We’re trying to get pregnant. (They start kissing, but Chandler stops it.) Y’know I’m not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. So, when do you want to start trying?",
        "Period math?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Right here?",
        "Wait a minute, it’s perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and we’re in a building that’s full of beds!",
        "Okay. (They start kissing.)",
        "Okay. Uh, we’ll dim the lights, dim the lights. (He goes to the light switch and finds it’s not a dimmer switch when he flips the lights off.) Or turn them out all together. Uh, no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go. (He sprays an aerosol air freshener above her.)",
        "Yes, 98.6. You’re gonna be fine.",
        "Should we tell Rachel there’s an empty private room right next door to hers?",
        "Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!",
        "If it’s not, then there’s two of them. And that would mean it’s the end of the world!",
        "Hi.",
        "Weirdest thing. Did I hear—(A nurse opens the privacy screen and Chandler sees Janice)—Mother of God it’s true!",
        "Jan-Janice!",
        "Janice I didn’t even know you were pregnant! Who’s the unwitting human who’s essence you’ve stolen?",
        "What?!",
        "That’s funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?",
        "It’s incredible, I mean one minute she’s inside you and then 47 hours later here she is.",
        "So, do you know what you’re gonna call her yet?",
        "So then I guess Ferdinad is out.",
        "You do?",
        "Oh no, it’s gonna be named after some snack or baked good isn’t it?",
        "That was amazing.",
        "And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.",
        "Yea yea. (Pulls the balloon out of his mouth)",
        "No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office (Pulls another balloon out of his mouth) Am I producing them?",
        "Couldn’t sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldn’t sleep. Y’know? I was like, if I fall asleep now I’ll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I’ll get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldn’t fall asleep.",
        "Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.",
        "Walter (nods).",
        "Yep.",
        "(not knowing what he’s saying yes to) Yes.",
        "(enters) Hey.",
        "Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?",
        "Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing",
        "Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?",
        "Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?",
        "People who’ve never ever been to Paris.",
        "We’re moving to Tulsa! (Makes a excited expression on his face)",
        "Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently, said yes.",
        "The Sooner State, whatever that is.",
        "Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning! Surrey With A Fringe On Top.",
        "No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus. (Monica’s not impressed.) I’ll get out of it.",
        "(hears Emma crying) What is wrong with Emma?",
        "Umm ma’am, do you have a minute? (She points for him to come in) I kind of have some bad news. I don’t think I can move to Tulsa.",
        "It’s a funny story, actually. (coughs) I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said I’d move to Tulsa, I didn’t really know what I was saying.",
        "But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, ain’t that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright (he sits down). See, here’s the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won’t go. See, me, I love Tulsa! Tulsa is heaven! Tulsa is Italy—Please don’t make me go there!",
        "No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol? (Pause) Wh-why would I when your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping! (She glares at him.) That’s a picture of your daughter, isn’t it, well she’s lovely. I like a girl with a strong jaw. I’ll call you from Tulsa. (Exits.)",
        "(entering, loudly) Hey!",
        "Oh so there can’t be any yelling.",
        "We’re moving to Tulsa",
        "Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! (Walks backwards towards the door) I can’t, I can’t hear you. (He runs out)",
        "(enters) Hey, what you guys talking about?",
        "(enters singing) Oklahoma where the wind comes sweeping down the plane, STOP IT! Why couldn't they have sent me to Texas? 7 o clock maybe I'll hit the gym (sits down) who am I kidding pay-per-view p0rn.",
        "DO NOT DISTURB DO NOT DISTURB! Monica: (smiles)",
        "everything's great, just watching some regular television there, what a pleasant surprise. (She hugs him, and she knows what he was doing so she looks at the TV and sees sharks swimming around thinking Chandler was giving himself a treat to sharks.)",
        "Ok honey. that was close.",
        "Hi honey I'm home!",
        "oh it was great.",
        "well, well, well it must be five in Tulsa because it's six o clock IN NY.C!",

        "no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie that's all.",
        "does what always have to be sharks.",
        "What's going on?",

        "(Ross and Rachel enter)\nHi!\nRoss: Hey! So what's the big news you had us rush all the way over here for?\nChandler: Okay, our news.

Well my boss and I worked out a deal where I only have to be in Tulsa four days a week, so the other three I can be here with you.\nMonica: So you're gonna be gone four days a week? (Thinks about it.) No.\nChandler: I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?\nMonica: No. I can't be away from you for that long.\nChandler: Really?\nMonica: Yeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year.\nChandler: That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.\nMonica: Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you.\nChandler: Hey, you said that without gagging!\nMonica: I know!

Ross was getting sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it.\nMonica: Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?\nRachel: Ross said he died.\nMonica: He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.\nRachel: Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.\nMonica: Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist.\nChandler: He saw a therapist?\nMonica: Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just really freaked him out.\nRachel: Why? What was it?\nMonica: That I was going to eat him.",
        "(Monica Enters. Chandler is in the kitchen with his laptop)\nHey!\nChandler: Hey!\nMonica: What are you doing?\nChandler: Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.\nMonica: That's so sweet. Find anything?\nChandler: Slim Pickings.\nMonica: Nothing, huh?\nChandler: No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite.\nMonica: 'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.\nChandler: 'So Cheesy' also has an opening.\nMonica: Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy, who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.\nChandler: Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.\nMonica: (On phone) Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo (sp?) is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo (sp?) 'I'll take it!'",
        "Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do.\nMonica: You're right. (Pause) Maybe I shouldn't go.\nChandler: What?\nMonica: So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javo (sp?). It's just a little outside of Tulsa.\nChandler: How far outside?\nMonica: Manhattan.\nChandler: And you're thinking of taking it? (Pause) So before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now it's old job, (Raises his hand) me, (Raises his hand) new job.\nMonica: I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.\nChandler: What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?\nMonica: Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.\nChandler: I think you should take the job.\nMonica: Really?\nChandler: Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.\nMonica: That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!\n(Ross and Rachel enter with Emma.)\nRoss: Hey!\nMonica: How was the pediatrician?\nRachel: Oh, I really liked him. (Looks at Ross) Yeah, it was really, really, really good.\nRoss: You promised you wouldn't say anything.\nRachel: I know. (Pause) Ross still sees his pediatrician!!! (To Ross) I don't care!\nMonica: Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?\nRoss: He's a brilliant diagnostician!\nChandler: Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?\nRachel: Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.\nRoss: Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'\nChandler: Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?\nRoss: Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!\nChandler: That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!\nRoss: It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!",
        "(Enters) Oh good, you haven't left yet.\nMonica: Where have you been?\nRoss: I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office. There was some guy that freaked everybody out.\nChandler: Well, you got here just in time. I really have to go buddy. (They hug)\nRoss: Oh man.\nMonica: Promise to call me when you land.\nChandler: Of course I will call you. I love you.\nMonica: I love you too. (They kiss)\nRachel: Okay, wow, wow, wow. Watch the tongue people, we've got a baby over here.\nPhoebe: Bye Chandler.\nChandler: Awww. (They hug) Bye!\nRachel: Bye honey. (They hug)\nChandler: (Tries to hug Joey but J. moves away) What's the matter Joe?\nJoey: I'm mad at you for leaving! You're nothing but a big leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.\nChandler: Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?\nJoey: Dude, you see right thru me!! (They hug) (Joey heads for the door and pushes Chandler's suitcase on the way out.)\nChandler: Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!\nPhoebe: Okay, bye-bye! (Pushes Chandler out the door.) Good trip! (Slams the door)\nMonica: (Runs out to the hallway) Chandler, wait. It goes: Old job, (Raises her hand) new job, (Raises her hand really high) you. This is just something I have to do.\nChandler: I know.\nMonica: I love you so much.\nChandler: I know that too. (They kiss)\n(Joey opens the door and takes Chandler's suitcase into his own apartment.)",
        "(On cell phone) Don't worry, I'll be back before you know it. Yes it will be the same. Because I know, that's how. I promise.",
        "Good morning everyone, it's nice to see our team together for the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions? (colleague raises hand) Yes, Ken is it?",
        "(laughs) Well, don't believe everything you hear, Ken.\n(both turning away to files) But yeah, that's true. Alright, let's\nget started, by take a look at last quarter's figures. (The female\nnext to Chandler starts smoking, towards heRoss:) Ah, Claudia, aren't\nyou supposed to blow smoke up the bosses' ass?",
        "No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right now, I can't remember why. (to everyone:) You're not allowed to smoke in this office. Not right?",
        "Alright, lo...look. I don't smoke anymore. But if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, it's fine. (everyone lights) So you all smoke then? That's almost rude, that I'm not.",
        "(loud) Ken, please! No, I can't, I can't smoke. If I smoke, my wife would kill me.",
        "I always liked you, Ken. (takes a cig)",
        "Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people.",
        "No! I just happened t'do a lot trivia's about smoking in different states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called Leyhallalookoos.",
        "Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?",
        "Pheebs?",
        "(getting in) Okay, something to cover the smell ... Oven cleaner! (sprays himself, reads label) Unscented!",
        "No thanks, I'm good.",
        "(shrinks back) Right. You know what? Actually I just get off the plane, so I'm feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower.",
        "(still backs away) Alright, the truth is, I soiled myself during some turbulence's.",
        "Yes, but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, five. A pack. Two pack...a...a carton. Three big fat cartons in two days. (How many cigs are there in one pack and how many packs in one carton in the US?) But it's over, I made a decision, I'm not gonna smoke anymore.",
        "But, those are for you.",
        "I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.",
        "Will power? I've watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs (?) without taking the tin foil off.",
        "'kay, look: Can we just drop this? I'm not gonna smoke again.",
        "You forbid me?",
        "You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she here by the way?",
        "Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?",
        "Then, I might as well ... (grabs the cigs) do this (lights one, exhales). Not really sure what to do now.",
        "Fine. What!?",
        "You serious? (follows)",
        "Right, fine, I'll do it, but no talking.",
        "And no kissing your neck.",
        "And lots of kissing your neck.",
        "Look, I can't do this. I can't make love to you while we're fighting this way.",
        "That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, I'm not gonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?",
        "Mean it?",
        "You are incredible. Unless, I...I'm not gonna smoke again. And if I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you. (they kiss)",
        "Yeah, let's celebrate life!",
        "Uhh. You are welcome.",
        "What?",
        "But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettes--no big deal.",
        "Leave it.",
        "You tricked me to get me into bed?",
        "I feel so used.",
        "I would never lie to get someone into bed.",
        "I suppose that Monica will have the ... manipulative shrew.",
        "You mean the lully story?",
        "Oh yeah, that's what she says. But maybe you're not ovulating at all, maybe it's just a clever ruse to get me into bed.",
        "(to Joey) You not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked me into having s*x with her.",
        "What's the matter with me? Why I'm such a girl?",
        "Mhum.",
        "So you never had s*x with a Kennedy, have you?",
        "Hi!",
        "How come?",
        "Do you have any ideas?",
        "(imitating Monica) Oh, and you know whose knowledge of her\nex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!",
        "Oh, well... Maybe I'll join them some time. I just hope the club\ndoesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face.",
        "So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? Medical\nmalpractice? Choked on his own moustache?",
        "mmm That's enough about you!",
        "No, no, no, no, no, NO! No, no... we're not together. We're not a\ncouple. We're definately not a couple.",
        "We're not gonna have this conversation again... Look at this\nplace. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, this huge macho\ncouch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing\nMonica to a real man! (laughs) You don't think he's here, do you? (Joey\nlooks around)",
        "(Chandler looks around the place and his eye gets caught by\nRichard's video collection) Look at these videos. You know, I mean, who does\nhe think he is? Magnum Force, Dirty Harry, Cool Hand Luke... Oh my God!",
        "There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.",
        "Get there faster! (Joey gasps and finally understands...)",
        "I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch it... I mean, what\ngood could possibly come from watching? (sighs) Well, we know I'm gonna\nwatch it. (Chandler moves to put the tape in the VCR and Joey enters the\napartment)",
        "Don't judge me, I'm only human!",
        "I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape\nof your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need to know what\nwas on it?",
        "Some girl...!?",
        "Yeah...!?",
        "Allright, I'm gonna watch it... I mean look, it's probably not\neven what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly be as bad\nas what I'm picturing in my head... (laughs nervously) Can it?",
        "Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.",
        "Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... Please?",
        "Why am I hearing cheering?",
        "Football? Just football?",
        "It's football... It's just football... This is great! This is the\nfirst time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to get a\nbeer... (Chandler walks to the fridge, his back turned to the TV and a\nmoaning sound replaces the cheering of the crowd... Joey's eyes double in\nsize...) What the... (Chandler turns around, but Joey already took a sprint\nfor Chandler, jumps, and floors Chandler in the open space in front of the\napartment door...) What are you doing?",
        "Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the p0rn star!",
        "Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard\ncould see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another\nsaucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and\nmoustaches.",
        "This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps\na tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.",
        "Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache!",
        "Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him\nwith your cowboy boots in the air...",
        "Oh, good, good. Play more, 'cause I wanna see how it ends.",
        "What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 'em cowgirl!",
        "Is that a problem?",
        "(picking up the telephone, answering it with a frog in his throat) Hello? (he clears his throat, but he still has the same frog in his throat when he speaks again) Hello?",
        "Honey, you're screaming.",
        "(yawning) Oh, that's great.",
        "(clearly not so interested) Awesome.",
        "(angry) Funniest guy she's ever met! (to the door) I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes... (laughs about himself, but then gets determined again) Save it for inside! (he enters)",
        "Hey!",
        "So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. (Monica looks at Phoebe, who also doesn't know what to say.) And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.",
        "(laughs, but then moves to Phoebe) And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.",
        "What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? (Monica laughs) See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?",
        "Yeah, he came up...",
        "(to Phoebe) Were you there?",
        "Hey! (Joey doesn't look up, but gestures 'wait a minute' with his finger while he finishes reading the article. Chandler waits for Joey to finish.) I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.",
        "(Can't believe what he hears) Well, thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.",
        "Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.",
        "Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?",
        "Yeah!",
        "Ye.... (stops because he realises what Joey just said, and stares at him. At this moment Monica enters)",
        "Hey!",
        "What are you guys talking about?",
        "You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...? (Monica starts laughing, but very exaggerated. Joey realises they also should laugh and punches Ross. Now all three of them laugh, but very fake. Chandler seems happy again.)",
        "You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse. (again they laugh, even more fake than before)",
        "If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would have brought more pizza. (they all burst out in a thundering laugh)",
        "What is so funny about that? (they realise it wasn't a joke)",
        "Did you tell her what we talked about? (Joey starts laughing hysterically, but then gets serious again...)",
        "So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS? (Joey and Ross walk away from the kitchen)",
        "Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?",
        "I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.",
        "Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at http://www.hahanotsomuch.com/.",
        "Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!",
        "I love you too. (Monica and Chandler kiss. He turns to Joey.) And... I like you as a friend. (They hug and pat each other on the back.)",
        "See ya! (he leaves the apartment)",
        "Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our wedding china today?",
        "Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.",
        "What is the point of having them if we never use them?",
        "I will explain it to her.",
        "Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa. Woo hoo!\nTV announcer: And heres the float with the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives .",
        "Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives?",
        "What are you going to do?",
        "Well you proved them wrong.",
        "I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives, I'll be careful until told otherwise. <looks at china> hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out..",
        "Why?",
        "Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?\n< Phoebe comes in>",
        "I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.",
        "You know, guys I got to say. This means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts to cry>",
        "No, if crazy plate lad.. <sees Monica frustrated at this comment> If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?",
        "Actually what?",
        "What?",
        "So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise Emma?",
        "Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!",
        "Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable?",
        "Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die <knocks on table>  she'd have to give her up.",
        "So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?",
        "Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?",
        "Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong father figure and I never will be.",
        "Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it.",
        "Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying \"Go to your room! You're grounded\"?",
        "You said that to me last week.",
        "Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey.",
        "Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now.",
        "Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.",
        "By the way, that fight was totally arousing.",
        "Oh yeah? Well thanks.",
        "Okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose.",
        "Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. <knocks over the box of china> Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first.",
        "Nope...",
        "Yep...",
        "Nope... (Monica walks in) Hey... so I'm gonna... put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time.",
        "Maybe not even then. (Joey walks in)",
        "Yeah. That’s a lot of cats, Jolene. Single, are ya?",
        "Chandler Bing.",
        "What’s up, Joe?",
        "Braid each other’s hair then ride horseback on the beach?",
        "Courtside? Oh my god!!",
        "That is so cool. I’ll let Monica know.",
        "Joey just called. He’s got courtside Knicks tickets for me and him tomorrow night.",
        "But-t it’s courtside! The cheerleaders are gonna be right in … [mouths last words so Monica does not hear them]. That’s not the way to convince you.",
        "I…I…I know. You’re right. I wanna see you too. I’ve just got to figure out a way to tell Joey. He’s really looking forward to this.",
        "Yeah, yeah, yeah. I’ll think of something.",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, well, look at you!",
        "Well, it’s great, well, I’m just wearing the same thing underneath! Look at you.",
        "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Joey can’t know that I am here.",
        "Because I didn’t know how to tell him that I couldn’t go to the Knicks game, so I just told him that I had to stay in Tulsa.",
        "Eh, it is always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion. [Monica glares at him] Except with you!",
        "You know, it’s funny. I’ve been practising the art of seduction as well! Hya! [Does a wiggle]",
        "Yeah. [Chandler’s phone goes off] It’s Joey.",
        "Hey, Joe!",
        "What? Why?",
        "Look, I can’t. What’s going on?",
        "[Loudly] No!",
        "[Quiet] Can you hear him now?",
        "[Loudly] No! Wait!",
        "Right. Just stay there. I'm coming home.",
        "Is that really necessary?",
        "Don’t you think it’s better for him to think that you’re cheating on me than for him to think that I'm cheating on him? [Silence] I heard it!",
        "Alright. I’ve got a plan. I’ll go down the fire escape…",
        "Hear me out, woman! I’ll go down the fire escape, then I’ll wait for a while. Then, when I come back up the stairs, it’ll just be like I got back from Tulsa. Then, Joey and I will come in here and see that there is no guy in here.",
        "Just gonna wait for a little while.",
        "It’s huge!",
        "Well,… you’re forgetting about the time difference.",
        "That’s right. Your husband’s home, so now the s*x can stop.",
        "Joey said that you’re in here with another man!",
        "What’s he doing?",
        "Alright, well, I’ll check the guest bedroom.",
        "Nobody here, Joe.",
        "I climb down the fire escape, and you can’t put that in the closet?",
        "I’m sorry. I told you that I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I didn’t…didn’t know…didn’t think you’d understand.",
        "I feel so bad. Is there, is there anything I can do to make it up to you?",
        "I’m sorry. That’s the one thing I can’t do. I promised that I’d be with Monica.",
        "[Turning around] What?",
        "Really? Are you going to be okay?",
        "You’re gonna put sweats on and clean, aren’t ya?",
        "Thanks. Listen, I’m never gonna lie to you again.",
        "And I want you to know that no-one thinks that you are stupid.",
        "Game’s tomorrow night, Joe. [Enters apartment]",
        "(coming from the bedroom) Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa.",
        "Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by\nthe end of the year. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired.",
        "So, who does?",
        "I'm sorry I won't be here.",
        "Thanks. (they kiss) I'll see you new year's day.",
        "Did I not mention that?",
        "(thinks for a second, then waves his arms, exclaiming:)\n...AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT! (and runs out of the apartment)",
        "All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas eve and you'd\nrather be with your familys, but there's *no* call (he takes\nit off) for writing \"Screw you, Mr. Bing!\" on the back of my\nchair! (he looks at it) -- By the way, you can all call me\nChandler.",
        "Hey. Where've you been?",
        "(to the others) You hear that? You may not be with your familys,\nbut at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.",
        "Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up! (he starts\nspreading envelopes among them) I had a little talk with the\nboys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been\ndoing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order.",
        "Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want\nme to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!",
        "I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with\nyour familys tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room\nand lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow\nmorning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses,\nwich, by the way, none of you have invited me to.",
        "Haha, no thanks!",
        "Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a\nmotivational speaker.",
        "Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty\ntraditional...",
        "I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.",
        "What? That's terrible!",
        "Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.",
        "No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!",
        "No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too.",
        "Why?",
        "No, I have a great idea for a present for her.",
        "If I help, we can find 'em faster!",
        "OK, Pheebs, your turn.",
        "And, a lemon lime.",
        "And last but not least.",
        "(entering in a Santa costume) Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!",
        "Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)",
        "Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing\nhere, weird...turtle-man?",
        "What?",
        "You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a\nSanta costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!",
        "Why?",
        "But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.",
        "Fine, I'll give the suit back.",
        "Santa? Really?",
        "Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?",
        "Then it's okaaay! (They kiss.)",
        "You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your\nfamilys. It's bad enough that we're working new year's eve.",
        "Good, God's speed, good people! (he starts to close the door,\nturns around and sees Wendy) You're not gonna go?",
        "Ah. Thanks.",
        "Ah. (The phone rings; he answers it) Chandler Bing.",
        "Ahh, merry Christmas; I miss you guys!",
        "Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy.",
        "It is. Did I... not tell you about her?",
        "I send them home.",
        "Uhh, uh...",
        "I don't know!",
        "I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a\ncolleague.",
        "Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me.",
        "BE-LOW me!",
        "Well, she... she didn't win...",
        "Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in\nOklahoma, she's probably...",
        "Honey, there's really nothing to worry about.",
        "I'm serious!",
        "Merry Christmas.",
        "Merry Christmas, you guys!",
        "(hanging up the phone) The wife says \"Hi!\".",
        "Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just\nbecause you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen.",
        "This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but...\nyou're getting ham on my only tie.",
        "Whoa-ho, back off, Missy! (He takes a step back, but she still\nkeeps her grip on his tie.)",
        "I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ...\n(She lets go of his tie) Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?",
        "(flattered) No,... no... (realizing) NO! (He quickly gets several\nsteps away from her.) Look, I'm, I'm married!",
        "I'm *happily* married.",
        "Right. So, I'm sorry...",
        "Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know.\nShe's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case:\nright on money! ... You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and\nsmart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass.\nLook, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery\naside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing\nis ever gonna happen between us.",
        "I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!",
        "You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms...\n(She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.)\nWhoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out!\nYou and I are making out?",
        "But we don't do that.",
        "How drunk are you?",
        "(thinks) That's the perfect amount!",
        "What?",
        "I know.",
        "Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you\nwanna get under the covers?",
        "Okay!",
        "It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.",
        "Yep!",
        "Count of three?",
        "Two!",
        "Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively\nruined.",
        "Eh! (They start making out again)",
        "So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?",
        "Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing\naround in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical\ndefinition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and\nhave amazing s*x and just wanna spend more time together. But\nif you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at\nme, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary.\nI am *so* bad at this.",
        "Really? Okay, so...",
        "Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?",
        "Right!",
        "Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! (Picks up a blue\nsweater.) Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.",
        "Let's go! (Starts to leave.)",
        "Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was\ntwelve.",
        "I don't think so.",
        "(looks around) Here just...take this. (Hands her the sweater.)",
        "No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.",
        "Okay, one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)",
        "Ehh.",
        "Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should\nspend all of the money on the wedding.",
        "Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I\ntold you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if\nhaving the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's\nwhat we're gonna do.",
        "Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two\nkids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get\nto go to college.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.",
        "Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place\noutside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their\nbikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell\non its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through\nthe little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over\nthe garage where Joey could grow old.",
        "Sure you do.",
        "You sure?",
        "I love you so much.",
        "Hey!",
        "I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.",
        "Monica.",
        "I never want to leave you again!",
        "Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.",
        "Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you.\nAnd why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what\nhe *really* wants to do?",
        "(realizing) I have *not* thought this through!",
        "I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it.",
        "Thanks!",
        "(flattered) Ahh...",
        "(to Monica) Here, pass these, will ya.. (points to the others)",
        "I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other\npeople. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.",
        "I don't have a *job*!",
        "Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer... (he looks\ndown on himself, checking, then nods satisfied and marks the\noffer with a pen) (to Monica:) Hey, d'you know what I just\nrealized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of\nthe household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!",
        "Hey!",
        "I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed! I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.",
        "I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?",
        "But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start.",
        "Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!",
        "How long was I in there?",
        "Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!",
        "I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though.",
        "I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? \"Cheese. It's milk that you chew.\" \"Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy.\" \"A grape.\nBecause who can get a water melon in your mouth?\"",
        "Honey? Leave it to the pros.",
        "\"The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones.\"",
        "No, no. But let me show you what I can do. \"Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood.\"",
        "Really? That's great!",
        "It's funny. When you said \"unpaid\" it sounded like you said \"unpaid.\"",
        "Actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have s*x tonight. Actually, she's probably at home naked right\nnow. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now.",
        "Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be\nstarting a family.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, Ross is here so...",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits.",
        "Oh god, I have to tell you something. You're not pregnant.",
        "That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.",
        "Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.",
        "That's actually why. Look, I'm starting a whole new career now, and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby, I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little\nwhile.",
        "Or a year?",
        "It could be less than a year. I mean, you've heard my stuff. \"Pants. Like shorts, but longer.\" (Pause) It'll probably be more than a year.",
        "I really wanna have a baby.\nChandler: Yeah, me too. Look, I'll just get my old job back.",
        "I quit and you learn what I do?",
        "I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.",
        "Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?",
        "Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time.",
        "Hey",
        "Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.",
        "I tried, but apparantly singing \"I will survive\" in a helium voice - not helping.",
        "(start to sing) Hey! Happy birthday ...",
        "Hi.",
        "Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.",
        "Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.",
        "Now that Rachel's gone?",
        "I wasn't staring. I was leering.",
        "Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.",
        "Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma.",
        "Seriously dude, 3 years ago.",
        "You don't trust him?",
        "Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.",
        "Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have s*x with it.",
        "Picturing that tree?",
        "Where you going, Joe?",
        "Oh. You mind if I join you?",
        "Your thoughts? Plural?",
        "I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.",
        "Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.",
        "Great novels?",
        "(In a helium voice, holding a balloon) I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.",
        "(still helium voice) Right behind you, big guy! (they both head for the door)",
        "Come on! Joe!",
        "(sings in a helium voice) First I was afraid, I was petrified (very happy)",
        "(normal voice) Hi",
        "Oh, well someone left this (shows a green jacket). This is yours?",
        "Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.",
        "Hey!",
        "Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who ever",
        "No!",
        "Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said",
        "So are you gonna...talk to her?",
        "You know when \"That's fine\" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!",
        "No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?",
        "Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!",
        "Why did I get married?!",
        "Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?",
        "Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,",
        "What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!",
        "Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing",
        "Did she go out with him?",
        "Ah! The high road...",
        "Are you trying to get everybody divorced?",
        "I thought I had to make the jokes!",
        "Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it.",
        "We still got it!",
        "I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed",
        "By drowning or...?!",
        "Well...",
        "Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley Judd?",
        "I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!",
        "It’s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!",
        "Ok. First of all, this is green!",
        "All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.",
        "Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mine",
        "Yeah, well, I guess you don’t need my help Victor Victoria!",
        "Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch.",
        "And done!",
        "Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?",
        "Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little worried I was uncovering a birthmark right about",
        "No problem.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I am sorry I am late. You’ll understand when you’ll see Joey.",
        "Really? In front of all this people?",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Are those my wife’s nipples?",
        "I gotta stop this.",
        "You, touching yourself, out!",
        "“Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but I helped him",
        "See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.",
        "Wow.",
        "Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!",
        "Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.",
        "No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!",
        "I don't do that.",
        "I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?",
        "Today is the sixth.",
        "Yes, it's also 2003.",
        "It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.",
        "Tough crib.",
        "I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.",
        "I am not working. There's not much to do around here!",
        "Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not. ",
        "I - I don't think I can.",
        "Because of Emma.",
        "Sorry.",
        "Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.",
        "Well, I can't say \"hump\" or \"screw\" in front of the B-A-B-Y.",
        "Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?",
        "You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have s*x with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.",
        "Emma was doing it!",
        "Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...",
        "I think we may have really done it this time.",
        "You may wanna get some more of those too.",
        "Where's Emma?",
        "Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!",
        "Okay. (Runs out.)",
        "All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.",
        "No, no, no.",
        "What? Why?",
        "Your family name is Tribbiani.",
        "Central Perk, Joey, Ross, Monica and Phoebe are there as Chandler enters]\nChandler: (excited) Guys, guys, I've got great news! Guess what…",
        "Thank you. I got a job in advertising. (Everybody cheers)",
        "Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship.",
        "Right. So, it'll be the same except… less s*x with you. (Joey nods)",
        "Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.",
        "Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating ",
        "(grinning awkwardly) Humiliating and noble!",
        "(entering) Good morning, everybody.",
        "Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guys… except for the tie, the briefcase… and the fact that I can rent a car.",
        "Yeah, well, I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom.",
        "Right. Look, I know I'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like I'm Bob Hope (he sits down) ",
        "The comedian? USO?!",
        "(entering, carrying a large box) Honey, I'm old!",
        "I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.",
        "Yes, but I don't think life experience with these. (He opens the box and takes an inline skate-like sneaker out)",
        "They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.",
        "What am I supposed to do with these?",
        "Well, first of all, they're not called \"sneakers\" anymore. Apparently, they're called \"kicks\" or \"skids\" and I think I heard somebody say \"slorps\". (He takes a sneaker) And here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. Kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity! (to Monica) Would you help me try to sell these?",
        "No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for. ",
        "Hey!",
        "Putting on the sneakers… thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything…",
        "Yes, how's this: They're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!",
        "(sitting on the couch) You know what… these aren't half-bad! (to Rachel) You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.",
        "Alright (He stands wearing the sneakers on) I feel younger already! ",
        "(on the floor) Yah, I think I broke my hip.",
        "Okay… (He stands up) You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age…",
        "A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know… maybe he falls… maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: \"Not suitable for adults!\" ",
        "Oh, thank you, sir… or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me (He sits down again)",
        "(over-enthusiastic) I don't know, I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow.",
        "The cold weather hurts my hip!",
        "(To Monica) Have I got a surprise for you? Pack your bags!",
        "What? No, I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont (shows them a brochure)!",
        "So, what do you say? Can you get out of work?",
        "Are you really that busy?",
        "Oh, that's ok.I'll just try and reschedule. (on the phone) \"Hi, this is Chandler Bing. I made a reservation there and I need to change it (pause) Oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? Can I just come some other time? (pause) Oh, can't you make an exception?\"",
        "(on the phone) \"Look, this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok?\" (pause) \"Oh, thank you very much!\" (hangs up) Yeah, I'm going to Vermont...",

        "Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation.",
        "New York.",
        "I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.",
        "Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?",
        "Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?",
        "Just give us the cheapest room you have.",
        "That's insane!",
        "Does that room have a closet I can lock him in? (pause) We'll take it.",
        "(aside, to Ross) What!? They are totally ripping us off!",
        "Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!",
        "Dude, you're shaking!",
        "USA Today",
        "And I also got... two more apples.",
        "I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.",
        "I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs (goes to take the bulb)...oh, you already got that.",
        "Ok, how about this (picks up the remote control)?",
        "Yes, but the batteries...",
        "Thank you, thank you very much!",
        "No!",
        "Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.",
        "Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.",
        "What?",
        "Look, we have enough, just walk away.",
        "There's a forest right outside.",
        "Ok, go quick!",
        "I got you something from Vermont! (Sits down at the table)",
        "Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?",
        "I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.",
        "Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.",
        "You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?",
        "No! We're not borrowing money.",
        "Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.",
        "That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.",
        "Yeah.... she's not so cute.",
        "Yes dear.",
        "Hey Joe!",
        "Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.",
        "And that would have made the official party line. (Joey nods) Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.",
        "What? What do you mean you know?",
        "Oh! Right.",
        "Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.",
        "Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that! (Joey begins writing a cheque)",
        "Oh ok.",
        "I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?",
        "What?",
        "What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?",
        "Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.",
        "Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.",
        "No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.",
        "Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.",
        "I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.",
        "Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection. (kisses monica) Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.",
        "Yeah?",
        "But honey you don't have to.",
        "Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!",
        "your ass?!?!?",
        "They...do that?",
        "God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?",
        "Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?",
        "(sedated) What?",
        "It's over/Joe!",
        "Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.",
        "Aaaaand....... hernia.",
        "Ah, look on the bright side, I mean you won't have to live with this ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you. (they hug again)",
        "Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million? No thank you!",
        "Still on Amelia Earhart?",
        "Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.",
        "(looking around at the others)I'll ask. (To Ross) Boohaki?",
        "Kinda like Joey.",
        "Pie eating contest?",
        "No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.",
        "(hysterical)Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it!! (picks up the phone)",
        "(into receiver)Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?",
        "(still on the phone)Damnit. Alright call me when you know more.",
        "One of the slots got filled.",
        "Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.",
        "Yeah I know.",
        "Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wanna get one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't care about Charlie.",
        "I can see the headline now: \"Lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm\".",
        "Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want.",
        "Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?",
        "Ooh! Calm down ...",
        "You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.",
        "You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.",
        "(looks around) I'll take this one too (to Ross) Uh ... Mommy?",
        "Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with him!! .. Alright, bye. (hangs up)",
        "Well no, Charlie's gonna get that.",
        "He's the boss's son.",
        "What about the ones you have on the nightstand?",
        "Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.",
        "Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!",
        "(to Mon) She's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ...",
        "Let me finish ... (to everyone else) however, it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!! (takes tickets from Rachel)",
        "Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!",
        "Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished...",
        "(looking at the answering machine) Hey, there's two messages. These could be from work!",
        "Ok, here we go! (he pushes the play button)",
        "This is..shhh!",
        "Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?",
        "Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it. (pause) But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?",
        "I got that!",
        "No.",
        "Ah, the \"I'm sorry I rejected you\" phone call. I'm not used to getting it from guys. (on the phone, getting up from the sofa) Hey, Steve.",
        "Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant! Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I'm not too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!",
        "Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?",
        "Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow (hangs up).",
        "What? (pause) Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter.",
        "Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?",
        "Thanks, man.",
        "Really? What?",
        "(smiling, surprised) Oh yeah? (looks towards the kitchen, worried) Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heart right out.",
        "Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout.",
        "Me too.",
        "Hey! Ready to go?",
        "What are you doin'?",
        "Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless .",
        "The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?",
        "Bet she'd sleep with you now...",
        "Let me see what you wrote about yourself: \"Doctor Paleontology, two kids... \" (pause) You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!",
        "Maybe we finish this for him! (he sits down on the sofa and he start typing on Ross' computer) \"Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best s*x I've ever had\"... aaand SEND!",
        "Oh, I'm so sorry!",
        "You're not gonna need my help?",
        "Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth (he goes towards the counter)",
        "I believe I read that somewhere!",
        "I respectfully disagree.",
        "Who cares? Nobody reads those things",
        "I don't have a page.",
        "Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.",
        "Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.",
        "Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! (Monica hangs up) I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go (starts typing something).",
        "Oh, you'll see my friend.",
        "(faking sympathy) And so young.",
        "Well, how you died was funny.",
        "It kills over one americans every year.",
        "You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!",
        "Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... (­looks at laptop screen)..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?",
        "Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?",
        "No, come on, you know that's not true.",
        "Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.",
        "Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.",
        "Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.",
        "Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? (looks at laptop screen)You're having a memorial service for yourself!?",
        "Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !",
        "There you go! Someone came!",
        "(in a mournful voice) Please, come in.",
        "Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.",
        "At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps (he goes in the bedroom)",
        "Some guy, Tom Gordon.",
        "(entering, very upset) Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!! (he shoves him out the door)",
        "Ok! (shuts the door behind Tom)",
        "Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!",
        "You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!",
        "Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?",
        "I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide. (Ross hides in the bedroom again)",
        "Kori? Kori Weston?",
        "Wow! You look amazing!",
        "Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all.",
        "Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood! (lets her in)",
        "I didn't know Ross and you were so close.",
        "I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.",
        "I missed most of the party (pause) Charlie's a girl, right?",
        "(to Joey) So, a professor, uh?",
        "Oh, yeah?",
        "Oh, well... Maybe we could... (he sweeps the stuff off the table and wordlessly invites Monica to have s*x on it)",
        "We really need to take those tests?",
        "But I don't wanna do it in a cup!",
        "It's weird! In a doctor's office?",
        "(embarrassed) I cannot believe Ross told you that! (pause) And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!",
        "Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!",
        "Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!",
        "I have a weird feeling about this place. (pause) How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.",
        "Deposit my specimen? You know, usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks, got it.",
        "Yeah, I guess!",
        "Oh, Come on!",
        "Why are you here?",
        "(to Heaven) No no no... I mean, why? why is she here??",
        "What!?",
        "I'd love to stay, but I have eh... (points at the cup) got a hot date... (starts to leave)",
        "(disgusted) I think it just fell off. (Leaves)",
        "(To the nurse at the nurses' station) My specimen is in the room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. Really helped speed the process along! (walks towards the common area and sees Janice is still there) Janice! You're not... gone?",
        "Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!",
        "I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.",
        "(Slightly panicky) Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?",
        "(smiling again) oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...",
        "(stares at her intently, then yells) It was a \"Wendy's!! \"",
        "(picking up a plastic cup similar to the one he deposited his specimen in) It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.",
        "Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly. (pause) No, she's not here but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? (his smile fades as he hears the answer) Oh. (pause) Well, so what does that mean? (pause) Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks. (hangs up)",
        "Doctor Connelly just called.",
        "Actually it's both of us.",
        "Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.",
        "It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. (pause) It means...",
        "(seriously) It means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.",
        "I'm sorry.",
        "Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.",
        "(browsing through a diary) Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.",
        "I could fall asleep at a play.",
        "(browsing through a diary) Uh, let's see, who do I hate?",
        "Hey!",
        "Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.",
        "(to Monica) No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.",
        "Where the hell is everybody?",
        "(To himself) oh yes, God yes!!",
        "I... I don't know... you seem lovely.",
        "(to Monica) So, how did you enjoy the play?",
        "Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.",
        "Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained (bitter woman's tone) not to listen! (pause) But after chapter 16: \"fat, single and ready to mingle\", I was uplifted.",
        "Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!",
        "Did somebody sign your bra?",
        "Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.",
        "Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death (runs away).",
        "(looking at the picture of the female reproductive system) Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!",
        "Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!",
        "Hi.",
        "Oh, DAMN IT!",
        "Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! (Dr. Connelly glares at him) Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!",
        "(entering) Hey guys!",
        "I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.",
        "But you come first!",
        "(sitting down on the couch) Ok.",
        "Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get p0rn if you're giving a sperm sample.",
        "Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.",
        "(stopping Joey) ah-ha!",
        "I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.",
        "Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!",
        "You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite! (pause) Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer.",
        "(to Mon) So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?",
        "So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!",
        "Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is \"spermtastic\"!",
        "No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.",
        "I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!",
        "Ok!",
        "(bringing the beer to Zack) Zack!",
        "So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!",
        "You don't like him.",
        "Alright! Just follow my lead!",
        "Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?",
        "(very seriously) That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.",
        "You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness (Monica stretches her neck to look behind Zack's head and then gives Chandler an \"ok\" sign)",
        "Sure! Alright...",
        "I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?",
        "(Proceeding with his dinner) We're teeth people Zack!",
        "You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?",
        "Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.",
        "Ok.",
        "I think we've found our sperm!",
        "Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?",
        "Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!",
        "Yeah, he's better!",
        "Really? Are you sure?",
        "(sighs with relief) Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm.",
        "So you know this leaves us with...",
        "How do you feel about that?",
        "Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.",
        "(smiling) Yeah.",
        "We are gonna be great parents.",
        "Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!",
        "Hey, Zack!",
        "Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.",
        "Really?",
        "My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.",
        "You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?",
        "You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.",
        "You're on!",
        "He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.",
        "She's cheating on Joey with Ross!",
        "Wow!",
        "How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!",
        "Anything?",
        "You do realise that's your brother?",
        "That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.",
        "Okay Buckwheat!",
        "And she's... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!",
        "(caresses the wall with his finger) Bye!",
        "He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it... (walks to Phoebe and Monica)",
        "You got it!",
        "Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?",
        "Enunciate!",
        "Hey!",
        "Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing.",
        "You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?",
        "Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!",
        "I think.... I think I can see your scalp.",
        "What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.",
        "Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.",
        "Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.",
        "You go back to work tomorrow night, right?",
        "So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?",
        "What are you singing?",
        "It's \"Ride of the Valkyries\" from \"Apocalypse Now\"... See, here's the thing: The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... I hate them!",
        "Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.",
        "Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.",
        "Hit yourself in the tooth?",
        "Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?",
        "Really? What happened?",
        "You can't move at all?",
        "If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?",
        "(trying to untangle her) Some of these look a little frayed.",
        "Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?",

        "This is what I want to do.",
        "(Picks up the \"Miss Congeniality\" DVD) She's an FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.",
        "Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, \"island's stuff\".",
        "Yeah, that's the same as \"it has something to do with wind\".",
        "(upset) She does?",
        "I wouldn't read too much into it.",
        "David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.",
        "Seriously, we're gonna do this?",
        "Oh, because his pen1s was too big. (he notices that David is not amused) Oh, I'm sorry, that's the kind of thing I do. (pause) They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?",
        "What?",
        "I didn't mean now...",
        "Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.",
        "David, I'm pretending to read here!!",
        "(smiling cheekily) I do! Want a hint? huh? \"I do\" (Monica looks confused, so Chandler repeats) \"I do\".",
        "David is going to propose to Phoebe.",
        "Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.",
        "I did! A pen1s one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?",
        "Man, that's some bad advice!",
        "That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!",
        "Tonight?! (looks at the ring) Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? (squints at the ring to emphasize how tiny the diamond is) Oh, there it is!",
        "(slaps him on the shoulder) Nice! (goes to Monica)",
        "Monica, can I talk to you for a sec? (Pulls her away from Phoebe and Rachel)",
        "David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!",
        "That would be advice!!",
        "Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?",
        "(offended) What? (pause) May I?",
        "(at the laptop) Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!",
        "Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!",
        "It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.",
        "Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.",
        "Well, it didn't say \"This is a virus\"!!",
        "Nude... (Ross looks at him)... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.",
        "It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?",
        "Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!",
        "I just feel awful.",
        "Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but... (Ross glares at him) you know, you and Monica have the same \"I'm gonna kill you\" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her... (Ross continues to glare at him and Chandler leans in as if he's going to kiss Ross)",
        "(pretending not to sense the tone) Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!",
        "Phoebe is going to say \"yes\"? That's, that's great!",
        "And there's not chance that will work?",
        "(pointing at her) Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!",
        "This vacation sucks!!",
        "You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.",
        "I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk? (doing David) \"Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh...\" Spit it out, David!",
        "I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.",
        "Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.",
        "I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!",
        "Hey! Remember when I had corneas?",
        "Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.",
        "(to a paleontologist sitting next to him) Not to mention the cold sores.",
        "(to the one sitting next to him) Really?",
        "I don't think so!",
        "Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!",
        "Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?",
        "And...?",
        "I'm not playing with you.",
        "She gets crazy! This scar (points to his forehead) is from Pictionary!",
        "(nearly whispering) Oh dear God, there's two of them!",
        "(to Phoebe) Did you know this about him?",
        "(interrupting her) OK!",
        "Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!",
        "(to Phoebe) Do you really find this attractive on him?",
        "I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one.",
        "Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner.",
        "Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?",
        "(exhausted) Ok, look! Enough is enough!",
        "Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!",
        "But...",
        "What about the obsessive cleaning?",
        "You ok?",
        "No, you didn't.",
        "Because I'm gonna play for ya.",
        "(In a loving voice) Yes, I do. Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you.",
        "(Still in a loving voice) You're welcome, sweetheart.",
        "All right Mike, let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins.",
        "And that's... how... it's done!",
        "I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!",
        "I don't know.",
        "That's why!",
        "So, you and Rachel tonight, uh?",
        "Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?",
        "What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.",
        "How can you be so confident?",
        "Really? Like you have a routine?",
        "Really?",
        "You mean like this? (he starts touching his thigh in a funny and awkard way)",
        "Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice. (They look at each other, both embarassed)",
        "...and beer!!",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs!",
        "She went on one of those spray-on tan places.",
        "(To Monica) Why...why?",
        "Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.",
        "Hey Pheebs!",
        "Who's Amanda?",
        "Are you trying to do a British accent?",
        "Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?",
        "No, had it done to me though. Feels good !",
        "Hello? Is someone on the line?",
        "Hang on, she’s right here. (he enters the living room and hands the phone to Monica) Someone's on the phone, for ya.",
        "(to Amanda) I get pedicures!",
        "Hold on! There is something different.",
        "Was that place... The Sun?",
        "Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!",
        "How was your date with Joey?",
        "You didn't like that?",
        "(without taking his eyes off the bra) You don't know! (Monica just smiles)",
        "If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!",
        "Well, aren't you a treat.",
        "That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!",
        "Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...",
        "Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.",
        "I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.(Chandler leaves the apartment. Joey sighs)",
        "Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.",
        "I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.",
        "No, I just had to get a picture of this.",
        "I see you later!",
        "Hey!",
        "Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.",
        "Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!",
        "There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...",
        "Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...",
        "Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?",
        "Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.",
        "I know, what are we gonna do?",
        "I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!",
        "To be fair this one does have nuts.",
        "Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?",
        "We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday. (Ross looks disappointed and switches the camcorder off)",
        "Was that Emma? Is she up?",
        "I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!",
        "To the bathroom!",
        "(Yelling) What are you doing? Get the hell out of here! (Phoebe and Joey come out looking shocked)",
        "You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?",
        "I'm begging you stop.",
        "(Also very excited) That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!",
        "Thats a bear.",
        "Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!",
        "I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?",
        "They left.",
        "I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?",
        "Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little.",
        "Ooh! That's my girl!",
        "Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?",
        "Me too...",
        "There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?",
        "I was kidding.",
        "No, not yet.",
        "Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.",
        "Emma, how old are you? How old are you today? (holds up his index finger again)",
        "Let's do it, come on!",
        "Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice's phone number on it.",
        "(he enters) Hey honey!",
        "Is Monica not here?",
        "Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!",
        "Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine! (silence) Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were mine!!!",
        "Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're right for the part.",
        "First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.",
        "Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?",
        "Hey you guys.",
        "Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part.",
        "Joe...",
        "Fine!",
        "Work, Joe!",
        "He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!",
        "That's good! I liked it, they didn't. (he sees Joey out of the window hitting on a girl) Joey, for God's sake, go to work! (Joey runs away).\n[Scene: A restaurant. Ross and Charlie are waiting for her ex-boyfriend, Benjamin Hobart]",
        "Hey Joe!",
        "Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.",
        "(Hands the tape back to him) I'm sorry man.",
        "(sounds nervous) Yeah! I... I... I liked it! (Joey continues to look at him suspiciously) But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches!",
        "(looks surprised) What!? Of course I did!",
        "I'm not lying to you, I watched it!",
        "I watched it!",
        "(now yelling) (pretending to look shocked) I did!",
        "(following him) I'm telling you, I watched the tape. (Reaches Joey's room and Joey slams the door in his face)",
        "Chandler:(In a sarcastic \"of course not\"!-tone) No!\nInterview room. Ross and two other professors (one man, one woman) are sitting on one side of a long desk. Benjamin Hobart is sitting on the other side]",
        "I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!",
        "What did I just say?",
        "Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...",
        "Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?",
        "He really is a chameleon.",
        "Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not.",
        "I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?\n[Scene: Central Perk. Monica, Phoebe and Rachel are on the couch.]",
        "Lying is wrong!",
        "I'm a pretty little girl.",
        "Thanks!",
        "Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.",
        "So excited about your letter!",
        "So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?",
        "That's where people make number two!!",
        "(reading) I don’t... uh... understand.",
        "On every word?",
        "And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?",
        "You know what? You don’t need a thesaurus, just write from here, (points at his own heart) your full sized aortic pump.",
        "I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.",
        "Word!",
        "She's right! If I were a guy and... (stops himself mid-sentence...everyone stares at him) Did I just say if I were a guy..?",
        "Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!",
        "Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?",
        "Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?",
        "Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?",
        "It's ok, it's ok. You know what? (Takes out his mobile) I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. (starts dialing)",
        "(on the phone) Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. (listens) Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. (hangs up looking very confused).",
        "(Still looks confused) They loved it.",
        "They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.",
        "She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.",
        "That sounds like fun.",
        "I think she looks cute. (Rachel turns around and stares at him angrily) ... but I am wrong!",
        "Hi Ross.",
        "Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?",
        "Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!",
        "There's a hair in my coffee.",
        "You know, it's funny. Every time you say \"triplets,\" I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.",
        "So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?",
        "I mean, you have a lovely home.",
        "That's great. (To Monica.) Can I see the book?",
        "You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?",
        "Hey, you must be Owen.",
        "I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.",
        "Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.",
        "You know how to use a compass?",
        "You do? That's fantastic!",
        "I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.",
        "What?",
        "I got nothing.",
        "Where are Bill and Colleen?",
        "We have to leave!!",
        "I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.",
        "But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?",
        "See? Intuitive!",
        "Which technically now you should give back!",
        "I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. \"Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real.\"",
        "Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.",
        "Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?",
        "I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident. (Runs off.)",
        "Hi!",
        "We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio.",
        "And so incorrect!",
        "Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.",
        "Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..",
        "I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.",
        "So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?",
        "Yes, but...",
        "Oh, screw it, I'm gonna be a daddy!!",
        "Yeah. Just weird, you know. It's like: \"Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?\"",
        "You're gonna be great.",
        "Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.",
        "Ok.",
        "That's what our friends call us.",
        "(astonished) I don't think that's exactly...",
        "So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you?",
        "Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!",
        "Yeah, wow.",
        "No-ot for me it doesn’t.",
        "Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?",
        "You should be. You’re really on top of stuff..",
        "Yeah, I did.",
        "We are NOT signing those papers.",
        "It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.",
        "You have gotta stop!",
        "She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.",
        "Your Veal Chop is $34,95!",
        "But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?",
        "I know..",
        "oh, honey..",
        "Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to. ",
        "So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.",
        "You're Jewish.",
        "Hey.",
        "The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.",
        "I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.",
        "Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.",
        "Erica wait!",
        "You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.",
        "Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.",
        "But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?",
        "You still want that baby?",
        "That's funny, we were doing the same thing!",
        "Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers.",
        "It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.",
        "(to Ross) Maybe you do that next time you get married!",
        "Hey!",
        "Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.",
        "You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!",
        "Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.",
        "(pointing at himself) Little people?",
        "What...? NO!",
        "(he stands up and he feels very offended) I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!",
        "I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine.",
        "Ok, ok, here we go.",
        "Here we go. Stand up straight. (smiling) Big smile. (opens the door and both are smiling exaggeratedly)",
        "But you already gave all your money to charity!",
        "I don’t think you can do that!",
        "That’s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.\n[Scene: The playground. Ross put Emma on the swing and they’re ready to play]",
        "Oh, because we love kids. Love ‘em to death.Well, not actually to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law.",
        "But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.",
        "What?",
        "Of course it was!",
        "RAT b*st*rd!",
        "OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO! (finally Monica concludes) No!",
        "Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with\nkids though.",
        "(Screams to interrupt Joey) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!",
        "Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls. (Joey bangs on\nthe door again)",
        "WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!",
        "Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.",
        "(nervous smile) You can't make this stuff up!\n[Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe and Mike enter]",
        "What the hell are you doing?",
        "Well, we're not.",
        "We don't have a code word.",
        "Any room that isn't behind this couch! (laughs nervously)",
        "(escorting Joey to the door) You have to get out of here. You slept with\nour social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so she can't\nsee you.",
        "Ok!",
        "What?",
        "And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! And we don't want to buy your bat! (Joey lowers his bat)",
        "I can explain... Joey...",
        "Oh, that's really ok.",
        "Wrong number?",
        "That's great!",
        "Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?",
        "Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.",
        "Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.",
        "No, no! We made this decision together.",
        "Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!",
        "We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?\nOPENING CREDITS",
        "Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?",
        "You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!",
        "Somebody is gonna pick us.",
        "I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing. (pause) What, he's my favourite author!",
        "(after a long pause) \"The Firm\"?",
        "You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.",
        "I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing \"high profile\".",
        "Tell me more.",
        "You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Hmm, the game's at one.",
        "Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back.",
        "You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.",
        "Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!",
        "Okay. (pause) And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!",
        "I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!",
        "(peeping) They're out there!",
        "(peeping) Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says \"Rangers\" on it. They went to the game!",
        "(looking through the peephole again) Ross' shirt is torn.",
        "Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... (speaking lower to Monica) what happens to cranberry sauce?",
        "(relieved) Oh thank God!",
        "(looking through the peephole) That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.",
        "Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it. (Monica looks at Chandler)",
        "HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!",
        "Please let me stay on this side of the door.",
        "The cranberries...?",
        "He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him! (They both look away)",
        "The floating heads do make a good point.",
        "Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.",
        "That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.",
        "A little late for that.",
        "Uhm, we've got turkey grease.",
        "Can you ever feel your ears?",
        "(sarcastically) Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!",
        "Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!",
        "Come on guys, PUSH!",
        "PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!",
        "My cranberries!",
        "Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!",
        "(to Monica) Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!",
        "What's going on?",
        "And?",
        "Are you serious? (they hug)",
        "That is the exact same thing.",
        "(looking at her) Seriously, answer faster!",
        "(to Phoebe) It's like a giant hug.",
        "(picking up the phone) Hello.",
        "Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day.",
        "Those are all really old!",
        "Hi!",
        "I was in the car with Nancy all day.",
        "Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!",
        "It’s perfect. It’s everything we’ve been looking for.",
        "And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? (pause) What were the things you said?",
        "And the fireplace in the bedroom.",
        "This is bringing out a lovely color in you!",

        "I do too.",
        "I know.",
        "I don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy’s car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.",
        "We don’t. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.",
        "I know. Gooooood luck with it.",
        "Hey!",
        "Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?",
        "Yeah (motions them to sit and they do) I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.",
        "...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.",
        "Actually, we already found a house we love.",
        "Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?",
        "I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.",
        "(goes towards Joey) You know that's not the reason Joe. (Joey hugs him and after, he takes something from the fridge and puts it in his mouth. He goes back to where he was standing before)",

        "(To Monica) Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window)",
        "Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.",
        "Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.",

        "No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)",
        "Sure!",
        "Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.",
        "Here, here!",
        "Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer.",
        "(to Nancy) Okay, thanks... (to Monica) They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price.",
        "I know.",
        "That's okay, we understand.",
        "Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it then.",
        "We got the house.",
        "I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.",
        "We're getting the house. (they hug) We're getting the house.",
        "We're growing up.",

        "You'll see.",
        "Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, but... We got the house.",

        "(looks over at her) Sure, nice.",
        "You're right, by saying \"nice\" I'm virtually licking her.",
        "Are you asking permission to break the pact?",
        "Awesome, the name really stands out.",
        "Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!",
        "Hey!",
        "You know, our band is playing on Friday.",
        "Fresh!",
        "Mint!",
        "I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out.",
        "I said it first, bro.",
        "(angrily) Look, if you did...",
        "Totally. I had s*x in High school...",
        "All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.",
        "All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.",
        "Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.",
        "Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.",
        "Your hands are shaking.",
        "(to the two guys) Excuse me. (Chandler and Ross move away from them). That didn't make us sound gay at all!",
        "Ross, that was 16 years ago!",
        "I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. (Ross just stares at him) All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.",
        "Oh really?",
        "Oh really!?",
        "ADRIENNE TURNER!! (A girl behind them turns around)",
        "Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her.",
        "Really?",

        "(smiling at Monica) Right. (to Rachel) So how're you doing?",
        "Hi Monica.",
        "O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross. (Goes off to find Ross.)",
        "Well, I did and it hurt. (they walk towards the bar) That's when I wrote the song: \"Betrayal In The Common Room\".",
        "Look (hands him a drink) it was a lo-o-ong time ago.",
        "(smiling a little nervously) Hmm mmmhm..",
        "(sighs) Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?",
        "Not her!",
        "Soo... you girls having fun?",
        "Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.",
        "Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.",
        "So where are you applying to?",
        "I'm in college and I'm in a band.",
        "Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.",
        "Why?",
        "You kissed her that night too?",
        "Seriously, where did this happen?",
        "Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?",
        "I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.",
        "Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?",
        "What did I marry into?\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK",
        "Hey!",
        "You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.",
        "No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.",
        "(to Rachel) You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.",
        "Heh.",
        "This is like figure skating team all over again. (Phoebe and Ross glare at him astonished) I mean synchronized swimming. (they continue to glare) I mean- I mean the balance beam. (to Ross) Help me!",
        "Thank you.",
        "I know, I hate being left out of things.",
        "Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.",

        "(almost crying) I wouldn't know, I didn't make it! (they hug)",
        "Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.",
        "Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.",
        "Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!",
        "Let me tell you why you need to pick me. (Goes to sit on the couch facing backwards to the kitchen. Rachel gets a chair and sits opposite him) See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.",
        "(Getting up and raising his fist in victory) Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make \"groom\" for Chandler.",
        "How's it going?",
        "(smiling to himself too) That's what I was doing too.",
        "You too.",
        "Me too.",
        "I'm not supposed to tell you.",
        "You told us both we could be in the wedding? (they both stare at Rachel)",
        "Rach, Rach, knock knock.",
        "I'll tell you at the wedding.",
        "So technically, would this person be in the wedding?",
        "I'm not scared. (moves towards Mike and Chappy) I'll just take little Chappy and... (he backs out) HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.",
        "(quickly) I'll do it.",
        "(to Ross) Na ha ha... (to Chappy) Ne he he... (Ross moves Chappy to Chandler, who quickly backs away) Ah ah...",
        "(to Monica) Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?",
        "Oh yeah! (Monica walks outside)",
        "Ready?",
        "Okay.",
        "Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?",
        "You look beautiful.",
        "That really was an incredible wedding.",
        "I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized s*x anyone's ever had.",
        "I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.",
        "So, where's Mike?",
        "Hey.",
        "Why are you wearing my apron?",
        "Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as \"my wife\" and \"the woman who's carrying my child\"? (she's not amused) No? Divorce?",
        "Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes \"Mooooo\"!",
        "I'm so sorry...",
        "Monica. Calm, self.",
        "Why would you say that?",
        "Great! (to Monica) This baby'd better to be really good.",

        "Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?",
        "That's great.",
        "So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?",
        "I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.",

        "O-okay. (steps closer to Monica and speaks softly) So, is she gonna take the test?",
        "Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it?",
        "How do you know?",

        "This can not be happening!",
        "The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers.",
        "That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?",
        "Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.",
        "Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and (apes Janice's voice) \"Oh My God\"!",
        "(looks afraid, but at the same time, knows she's right) Well, we have to do something. We can't have her living next door. (Janice's laughs loudly outside) Oh, that does it too. (Motions with his index finger like Monica did)",

        "Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.",

        "I understand.",
        "(speaking as in pain) They're never coming down now.",
        "Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Next time, can I say breathe?",
        "Where are you going?",
        "You can't leave me alone with her.",
        "This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!",
        "It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.",
        "Okay.",
        "So, ah... Any plans for the summer?",
        "Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?",
        "Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.",
        "One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this.",
        "Is it really that bad?",
        "I'm okay.",
        "Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.",
        "Wow!",

        "Well, that's spongy.",
        "I know. He has your eyes.",
        "I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does.",
        "Okay.",
        "How do you feel?",
        "Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!",
        "Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.",
        "Interesting! (To Monica) Can I see you for a second?",
        "What do we do?",
        "(panicking) Twins! Twins!!",
        "Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one?",
        "Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody.",
        "What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?",
        "Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!",
        "(smiles) Okay. Shhh...",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay!",
        "(shocked) She? It's a girl?",
        "(To Monica) Well, now we have one of each! (To the doctor) And that's enough!",
        "Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a v*g1n* and they meet.",

        "Her name is Erica.",
        "Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.",
        "I love you.",
        "I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!",
        "We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this.",
        "Really? You got us a chick and a duck?",
        "Oh, don't worry, we'll find them.",
        "Alright.",
        "It's okay, it's just an egg roll.",
        "Okay, let's find these birds.",
        "Well, that can't be good!",
        "How?",
        "Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.",
        "Joey, wait! The ball!",
        "I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.",
        "No... It's all glued together.",
        "I don't know. Maybe.",
        "I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.",
        "Did that movie ever get made?",
        "And we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.",

        "Well, I can't do it either.",
        "We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!",
        "That was... Impressive.",
        "Sorry about the table, man.",
        "You gonna buy a new one?",
        "Well, at least we got these little guys out.",
        "Aww, we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?",
        "Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.",
        "Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And, plus, here they'd have their own room.",
        "You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry.",
        "I think there may be another reason. So, awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?",

        "Where's Ross?",
        "(to his children) Look around, you guys. This was your first home. And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. But more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!",

        "I know. I was sweepin' yesterday. It coulda been me.ROSS: Sure, sweepin'. You never know.",
        "Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?",
        "You don't believe in evolution?",
        "Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?",
        "Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.",
        "You uh, you don't believe in gravity?",
        "How can you not believe in evolution?",
        "Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.",
        "You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.",
        "Well, there you go.",
        "Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?",
        "Please tell me you're joking.",
        "No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--",
        "Is there blood coming out of my ears?",
        "You remember Janice, right?",
        "Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.",
        "It's the only possibility, Phoebe.",
        "There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.",
        "What?",
        "You comin'?",
        "Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!",
        "Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.",
        "Ok.",
        "Oh, you and me?",
        "Ok.",
        "As in, \"I now pronounce you wife and wife\" married?",
        "Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.",
        "No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!",
        "Mmm hmmm.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.",
        "Would it matter?",
        "I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?",
        "If you wanna call that a reason.",
        "Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.",
        "Excellent!",
        "That is so good! Do it again!",
        "No no, that's me.",

        "And you had no idea they weren't getting along?",
        "No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.",
        "What's the matter?",
        "What?",
        "Carol, what's the matter? What happened?",
        "Oh my god.",
        "It's ok. I'm sorry.",
        "I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.",
        "Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.",
        "Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.",
        "Any time. [He doesn't want to let her go]",
        "Yeah, can't help but.",

        "There we go. All better. (gives Ben back to Monica)",
        "Come on, don't do this.",
        "I don't know. What's in this pie? ",
        "Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie.",
        "And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi.",
        "Ugh.",
        "Ugh. It's definitely getting worse.",
        "Either that or my mouth is getting smaller.",
        "You know, you know, actually it's getting better. It is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone for Thcrabble?",
        "What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.",
        "I don't think tho.",
        "Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.",
        "??? (speech garbled) Thro up a thro thro--a thro thro!",
        "Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun. ",
        "Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?",
        "Tho?",
        "Ohhh.",
        "Ok.",

        "Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?",
        "Oh.",
        "Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb? ",
        "I hope Ben has a little sister.",
        "I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?",
        "They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it.",
        "I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?",
        "Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?",
        "Will you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here.",
        "You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.",
        "Whip it out, whip it out.",
        "Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?",
        "You were in a porno?",
        "[to Chandler] So what's it shaped like?",
        "So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?",
        "You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?",
        "[holding cream pitcher] Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. [holds pitcher in front of Chandler's chest and flips the lid] Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?",

        "It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird.",
        "What?",

        "Oh look, I can't believe this. Look, homo-habilus hasn't even learned how to use tools yet and they've got him here wi, with clay pots. Why don't, why don't they just give him a microwave? I'm sorry, I'm sorry this is taking so long, ya know, I, I, it's just it's longer than I expected, we will have dinner.",

        "Get out.",
        "[looking at a glass table with a panther shaped base] Look, check this out. Is it a coffee table, is it a panther? There's no need to decide.",
        "Well uh, it's cause he had a thing with, wi-, with the thing.",

        "[comes out] All yours.",
        "[in a childish voice] I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.",
        "[childish voice] Shut up.",
        "[childish voice] Mi-mi-mii.",
        "I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.",
        "Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated.",
        "No. You're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now, OK, you're not... rommmates anymore.",
        "No, there is no way he was a velociraptor. No Tony, look at the cranial ridge, OK. If Dino was a velociraptor, he would have eaten the Flintstones. Yeah, yeah. [Monica comes out of her room] Oh, were you takin' a nap?",
        "Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line. [gets the other line] Hello. Oh yeah she's here but uh, can she call you back? OK thanks. [hangs up the other line] Call Joanna. [back on with Tony] Hi.",

        "Wha-, oh, quit it.",
        "Well, Monica keeps changin' the channel.",
        "Well, I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight.",
        "Ow, ow, OK. Alright, alright, Mon, Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, alright.",

        "You hated me when we were kids?",
        "Why did you hate me?",
        "And that wasn't fun for you?",
        "I can't believe you hated me.",
        "Really?",
        "I can do that.",
        "So you wanna watch uh, Entertainment Tonight?",
        "What?",
        "Ohh... OK. [changes the channel]",
        "What woman?",
        "What? What's on your shoulder?",
        "A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? [to Rachel] Hi.",
        "No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?",
        "I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'",
        "Alright, shall we?",
        "Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it. [opens door] We're here.",
        "Hi ma.",
        "Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.",
        "Dad, you really don't want to do that.",
        "Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.",
        "Mon, Mon, are you OK?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Eww.",
        "Ohh.",
        "Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?",
        "I'll take that dad. [grabs the bat]",
        "You got a tattoo?",
        "Lemme see. [looks]",
        "Well it's really. . . sexy. I wouldn't have thought it would be but. . . wow.",
        "Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?",
        "Hey, save us some pizza. [they go off to Rachel's room]",
        "Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck.",
        "I'm sorry I'm late, what happened?",
        "Well, we should probably get going.",
        "My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.",
        "G'night.",
        "Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?",
        "C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them.",
        "Better not be doin' these in order.",
        "Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.",
        "Really?",
        "Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.",
        "Animal s*x, animal s*x? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk s*x?",
        "Knock-knock.",
        "Until now. [jumps on Rachel on the bed]",
        "[comes out of the bedroom] Rachel. [growls then sees Richard standing there] Hey.",
        "Good, good, good. So, is uh, was your moustache, did, used to be different?",
        "Oh. How do you uh, ya know, keep it so neat?",
        "Oh. And what do you call that?",
        "So were you in Nam?",
        "No, no way. You've got it totally the other way around my friend. John Voit was...",
        "What, what oh....[Ross and Rachel go into her room]",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "No. [sound of Dr. Remore's body hitting the bottom of the shaft] Now maybe.",
        "C'mon.",
        "Open up. We want to talk to you.",
        "How could you not tell us?",
        "Hey.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh man.",
        "You got it.",
        "Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.",
        "On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.",
        "Freakish.",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "Yeah alright.",
        "Oh, sorry we didn't know.",
        "Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee.",
        "Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat.",
        "Because it's a special hat. [Chandler looks at Ross funny] See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler...",
        "It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know. We're grown ups, this kinda stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore.",
        "Hi.",
        "What?",
        "Do you say this stuff to girls?",
        "You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.",
        "Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat.",
        "Thank you Gunther. We didn't want to have to go and do that.",
        "Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice. [flicks the ends of the big bully's tie]",
        "I know.",
        "Let's, let's take this outside? Who talks like that?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight you guys.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "How come it's not mixing with the water?",
        "No.",
        "No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.",
        "Yeah, sure.",
        "No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.",
        "Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take?",
        "I think we proved our point.",
        "Cannot feel my tounge.",
        "Yes, and that's why we're here.",
        "Woah, ho-ho, whad'ya got there, a weapon?",
        "Whad'ya mean?",
        "Before I forget, are we hitting faces?",
        "Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation.",
        "Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I'm standin here, huh.",

        "God, that was, that was amazing, that was incredible. You guys, you guys kicked butt.",
        "Yeah he was wasn't he.",
        "So, listen guys, are we uh, are we ok here?",
        "Alright.",
        "[enters] Hiii.",
        "Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox.",
        "Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it.",
        "You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.",
        "Ok, dinner's on.",
        "Alright you kids, bye now.",
        "Oh look, a low budget puppet show.",
        "So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?",
        "Wow, it, it's neat learning about submarines.",
        "Bye Ryan.",
        "You like that do ya?",
        "I'll make some calls. [Runs off.]",
        "Is this what you had in mind?",
        "I'm shipping out tomorrow.",
        "Alright you know, why don't I just meet you upstairs. [Drops her on the couch and walks out holding his lower back.]",
        "Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?",
        "Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.",
        "Hi honey, how did it go?",
        "Thanks for being born.",
        "Oh, now you can exchange them if you want, ok.",
        "Really?",
        "All right.",
        "What?",
        "You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares.",
        "That's who.",
        "Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?",
        "Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery....game?",
        "I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.",
        "Oh, here, I, I'll get it for ya. Whad'ya want?",
        "Scotch. Alright, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass.",

        "Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom. Stay clear of the salmon mousse.",
        "Oh, mine too. Isn't that neat, scotch neat. Would you excuse me? [walks out in the hallway, Mr. Greene is walking out of Chandler and Joey's apartment] Hey, hey, where you uh, sneakin off to mister?",
        "No. no.",
        "No, um, see 'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir.",
        "All righty roo. [closes the door] What a great moment to say that for the first time. [goes to get the cigarettes and glasses]",
        "Mine.",
        "Um-hmm. [puts them on] I have a condition, apparently, that I require two different sets of focals.",
        "Neil Sedaka wears them.",
        "Ohh, big smoker. [Packs the cigarettes and flings one on Mrs. Greene in the process. Finally gets one in his mouth and it look really out of place] Big big smoker. In fact I'm gonna go ou into the hallway and fire up this bad boy. [as he walks into the hall, he comes face to face with Mr. Greene]",
        "Yes. [pulls them off and hands them to Mr. Greene] I was just warming up the earpieces for you.",
        "[pulls the cigarette off his upper lip and hands it to Mr. Greene] Yeah, yes it is, I was just moistening the tip.",
        "I'm getting ready for the water skiing. [Mr. Greene opens the door which pulls Ross in] How are you doing?",
        "What're you talkin' about?",
        "Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end?",
        "[smells Ben's butt] No no, you're fine, you're fine.",
        "Hi.",
        "Oh you guys are not gonna believe what happened.",
        "Ok, we were sitting over there playing on the floor and he grabs the table and he pulls himself up. He pulled himself up. Standing man. I'm sorry you guys missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it.",
        "I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?",
        "Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want him for more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen , I mean, I feel like-",
        "Really? I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared.",
        "Oh look, did, did you just see that? Did you see? He just waved, he just waved, he's never waved before, you've never waved before. Yes he has. Very good.",
        "Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg.",
        "Buy mommy.",
        "Have a good time. Ok, Ben.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.",
        "Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.",
        "Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.",
        "Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off.",
        "What're you doing?",
        "Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb.",
        "Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.",
        "Ok, here, here. There we go.",
        "It's alright, it's no big deal.",
        "Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby.",
        "What?",
        "Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.",
        "Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.",
        "Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.",
        "Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.",
        "Huh?",
        "[enters] Ok, what the hell happened back there?",
        "Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.",
        "C'mon, what, you never think about our future?",
        "No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.",
        "The big book of childrens' names.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Ok fine.",
        "We're not done.",
        "Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.",
        "Good, 'cause I love you.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well that's the first time we've said that.",
        "Well, I'm gonna kiss you.",
        "Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail.",
        "[doorbell buzzes] Hello.",
        "Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together. [walks in his room]",
        "Wha, what?",
        "What, the word hi?",
        "Great, great, and I miss that too, I miss everything.",
        "Something about hi.",

        "Bye.",
        "Bye.",
        "Hey you guys.",
        "Uh, sweetie we've gotta go.",
        "No?",
        "Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.",
        "Excuse me, your, your, your wind?",
        "You, you know I, I don't, have a- have a problem with that.",
        "I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it.",
        "What, what's that?",
        "Open it, open in.",
        "Woah.",
        "Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due.",
        "What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?",
        "Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World.",
        "That audition.",
        "Joey, you owe $1100 at I Love Lucite.",
        "So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money.",
        "Toilet paper?",
        "Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic.",
        "I am your friend.",
        "But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.",
        "Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another.",
        "Huh, I'm just saying...",
        "Ya know, maybe, maybe I should just go.",
        "Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok.",
        "[enters] Oh my God, what's goin' on?",
        "No look I wasn''t right, that's what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey.",
        "Yeah. And you should hold out for something bigger. I can't tell you how much respect I have for you not going to that stupid cab driver audition.",
        "Great, how did it go?",
        "Good for you.",
        "You're livin' the dream.",
        "All right then.",
        "What?",
        "[approaching the mover holding the parrot] Hey hold on, hold on. How much for the uh, how much to save the bird?",
        "Dollars? You spent $1200 dollars on a plastic bird?",
        "Go ahead, go ahead with the bird. Ok, do you have anything for around 200?",
        "Huh.",
        "I'll take it. My gift to you man.",
        "Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. (Rachel looks at him in disbelief) Or you just do it.",
        "Over my dead body! (Joey looks at Chandler)",
        "(entering from Rachel's bedroom) Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good! (turns around, and under his breath, to the rest of the guys) Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good.",
        "So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.",
        "What's she look like?",
        "Get out!",
        "Get away from me I said no!",
        "Hey, there. ",
        "Are you all right?",
        "Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride.",
        "Okay, good luck (kisses her and leaves)",
        "I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'",
        "Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad.",
        "(standing up) Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that...",
        "Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.",
        "Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis. (da-doom-chesh) (to drummer) What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me (looks for the da-doom-chesh, and doesn't get one) Cheers.",
        "(runs after her) No, Rach!",
        "Marenge,",
        "Everybody!",
        "(seeing her also) Yeah, 'cause life's just that kind.",
        "All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes (kisses Joey).",
        "I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.",
        "Hey Mon!",
        "Nope.",
        "Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.",
        "Getting it away from me would be job one.",
        "You need to get some sleep.",
        "Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.",
        "Hmm?",
        "Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.",
        "I think I have an old band uniform from high school.",
        "Yeah.",
        "What?",
        "No.",
        "Nope.",
        "What?",
        "Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?",
        "Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia.",
        "Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty cool.",
        "(entering with Monica in tow) Hey!",
        "Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter.",
        "Okay.",
        "Hi.",
        "Guess what?",
        "They published my paper.",
        "How could you have told her?",
        "Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.",
        "Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.",
        "That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.",
        "Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.",
        "Noo!",
        "Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?",
        "Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?",
        "I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think.",
        "Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?",
        "No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth....",
        "Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?",
        "Nooo!",
        "Yeah?",
        "Okay, okay, I'll go first.",
        "So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing....",
        "Yes!",
        "Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.",
        "Okay.",
        "Hmph.",
        "With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!",
        "Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?",
        "I said 'share' not 'scare'. Go sit over there! (Chandler goes over and sits at a table and puts his head down).",
        "No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's (turns and sees his Mom standing where Rachel is)",
        "I hate Chandler, the b*st*rd ruined my life. (Rachel starts looking around and down, with a 'What the hell is going on?' look on her face.)",
        "(to Chandler) Are you intrigued?",
        "There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi (Ben is\n      holding a Barbi doll) What's ah, what's my boy doing with a\n      Barbi?",
        "Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it,\n      again?",
        "You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so\n      am I.",
        "Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how\n      'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? (makes a\n      monster truck sound) No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder?\n      (squawks like a dinosaur)",
        "And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?",
        "You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very\n      important to you.",
        "(to Joey) Where there is no fear of commitment.",
        "Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben.\n      (singing) 'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi,\n      drop the Barbi.",
        "Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!",
        "Go Joe!!!",
        "(running into the hall, in slow motion) You'll never get me,\n      Joe!!! (he then pretends that he gets shot repeatedly and falls\n      back against Joey and Chandler's door, dead.)",
        "Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he\n      chose.",
        "Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't deal\n      with it, that's your 'too bad.'",
        "What?",
        "What are you talking about?",
        "Okay, you are totally making this up.",
        "(remembering) Oh God.",
        "There was no song. (to Monica) There was no song!",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay, that's, that's enough. (retreats to the bathroom)",
        "(coming out of the bathroom) Won't you dance around with me. ",
        "(singing) 'I am Bea. I drink tea. Won't you dance around\n            with....' (spills some tea and it drips onto his/her\n            dress) Ohhh! (runs away crying)",
        "I’m sorry the answer there would be...none of us.",
        "Yeah, I’ll take some.",
        "What?",
        "Hey, y'know while we’re on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don’t live here anymore.",
        "Phoebe, she doesn’t know that you sneak out every night, she doesn’t know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn’t know that you’ve been living with your Grandmother’s for a week now.",
        "Hey.",
        "So how many more do you have tomorrow?",
        "(to Phoebe) Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.",
        "I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...",
        "Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.",
        "Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn’t really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it’s gonna make a difference",
        "No real-, honey, really it’s fine, just g-go with Susan. Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay, okay, bye",
        "I don’t know, something girlie.",
        "(all depressed) Hi. Where is everybody?",
        "My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.",
        "‘Cause Carol’s a lesbian. (Phoebe is shocked) And, and I’m not one. And apparently it’s not a mix and match situation.",
        "(sets out a bunch of shot glasses and starts to poor himself a drink, many drinks) I’m an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I’d be out and she’d, she’d see some beautiful woman, and, and she’d be Ross y'know look at her, and I’d think, God, my wife is cool!",
        "Well, now I do!!",
        "Seven years. I mean we’ve been together seven years, she’s the only woman who’s ever loved me, and the only woman I’ve-I’ve ever....",
        "Maybe this would’ve happened if I’d been more nurturing, or I’d paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can’t believe this!",
        "Thanks.",
        "Thanks. (kisses her on the lips)",
        "Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.",
        "Wait, wait, wait.",
        "My foot is stuck in the pocket.",
        "No, I can’t get it out.",
        "No, come on don’t start. (they start kissing again) Ouch!",
        "Stupid balls are in the way. (holds up two balls)",
        "Oh well. It probably would’ve been the most constructive solution.",
        "Huh? (the rest of the gang enters)",
        "My wife’s a lesbian.",
        "Hi.",
        "Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and s*x with celebrities.",
        "Spiderman?",
        "Thank you.",
        "Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First, I’ll divide my perspective canidates into catergories....",
        "Hey.",
        "Okay, I’ve got three of my five.",
        "Celebrities I’m allowed to sleep with.",
        "Yeah, it’s hard okay, I only have two spots left.",
        "Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....",
        "Susan Sarandon.",
        "And!! Isabella Rosselini.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Okay, I’m done with my choices, these are final. (holds up a little card)",
        "Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer.",
        "That would be me.",
        "Hey, it’s my list.",
        "Okay!! Okay!!",
        "Heavy thing, not getting lighter!",
        "(to Gunther) Thank you.",
        "Isabella Rosselini. (points to her)",
        "Damn! I can’t believe I took her off my list.",
        "Yeah, maybe.",
        "What you don’t think I’d go up to her?",
        "Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.",
        "Okay, hold my crawler.",
        "(to Isabella) Hi! Hi, I’m Ross, you don’t know me, but I’m a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? (Gunther hands her change) Or maybe reimburse you for that one?",
        "Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that’s okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, (gets his out) so I’m allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it’s flattery.",
        "Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don’t, don’t just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...",
        "Um, yeah.",
        "Um, no.",
        "But, okay.",
        "Um, see, but that’s not the final draft.",
        "Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler (Chandler waves) brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.",
        "What?",
        "(to the rest of the gang) We’re just gonna be friends.",
        "So I told Carl, ‘Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.’ But of course this went in one ear and out.....",
        "Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie.",
        "We?",
        "Oh shoot, tomorrow’s not so good, I’m supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.",
        "Please, he refers to me as ‘wethead’.",
        "Fine.",
        "Hi Gunther.",
        "What?",
        "Come on! That’s great.",
        "Y’know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.",
        "Nice to see you again Dr. Green.",
        "Ugh, museum.",
        "There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one.",
        "Yeah, if you’re really hungry. (Dr. Green stares at him) It was a joke, I made a joke.",
        "It’s not a library...",
        "So, Dr. Green, how’s the old boat.",
        "It gives it a nice antiquey look.",
        "Wow. I’m sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that. (Rachel giggles at that)",
        "Okay! (picks up a knife and pretends to stab his heart.)",
        "Yeah. (sees the bill) Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must’ve added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.",
        "That’s Daddy?! But doesn’t it bother you? You’re a waitress.",
        "So?",
        "You really serve people sneezers?",
        "Thanks again, Dr. Green.",
        "Oh, ah, you don’t need that.",
        "The carbon, it’s messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.",
        "Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it’s a sickness really.",
        "I know.",
        "Nothing I do means anything, really.",
        "Well Mr. Big Shot is better than ‘wethead’.",
        "Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there’s a bug in my food.",
        "Yeah, I’m gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.",
        "Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?",
        "Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn’t work.",
        "Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn’t make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say ‘Like me! Like me tiny doctor!’",
        "Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we’re never gonna get along.",
        "Okay, okay, okay. (hugs her) I’ll get the bagels.",
        "Dr. Green. How are you? (offers his hand, and Dr. Green puts his scarf on it.)",
        "Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.",
        "(to Rachel) Okay, that’s it, I can’t take it anymore.",
        "Oh, please. Sweetie it’s hopeless, okay, I’m just gonna go. (starts to leave rubbing his neck)",
        "Look, look I’m sorry. It’s just that....",
        "Thank you! That’s what I keep saying.",
        "Uh.",
        "And his first name.",
        "Oh-ho please. Ask her how?",
        "Argue with that.",
        "I know that!",
        "What can I do, she doesn’t listen to me about renter’s insurance either.",
        "Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?",
        "Okay. (to Rachel) Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?",
        "Excellent!",
        "Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.",
        "Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.",
        "All right here. Watch me execute the three ‘P’s of championship play. Power. (swings the racquet) Precision. (swings the racquet.) and penache. (does a backswing and hits Sarah who’s started up the stairs, knocking her down, they both watch in horror.)",
        "I know. I feel horrible. Okay.",
        "Well, I’m gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she’ll like?",
        "All right, see you guys. (starts to leave)",
        "So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don’t have to sell those cookies anymore.",
        "Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?",
        "I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.",
        "Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. (starts to get out his wallet) How much are the boxes?",
        "(puts away his wallet) And what is second prize?",
        "Well, that makes sense.",
        "Yeah, Sarah, anything.",
        "Hi, I’m selling Brown Bird cookies.",
        "No, hi, I’m, I’m an honorary Brown Bird (does the Brown Bird salute.)",
        "Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I’m not invited to sleep-overs.",
        "No, please, please, um, it’s for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.",
        "Okay, okay! I’m going. I’m going. (goes across the hall to knock on another door.)",
        "All right!!",
        "...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.",
        "Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I’m trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I’m putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?",
        "No, but ah, there’s coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I’ll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.",
        "Mon?",
        "Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, y'know I’m sure that’s not gonna happen this time, why don’t I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph’s.",
        "Oh, come on, now you know you want ‘em.",
        "I’ll tell you what Mon, I’ll give you the first box for free.",
        "Come on! All the cool kids are eating ‘em! (chases after her.)",
        "....and 12, 22, 18, four... (Chandler starts laughing) What?",
        "Ah, we’re out. I sold them all.",
        "Monica, I’m cutting you off.",
        "Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.",
        "Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!",
        "Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as ‘Laser Floyd’ was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That’s when it occurred to me, the key to my success, ‘the munchies.’ So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me: 'Cookie Dude!'",
        "Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?",
        "Well you sure used a large font.",
        "Sweetie, calm down, it’s gonna be okay.",
        "What, that wasn’t the great news?",
        "(to the girl sitting next to him) Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell?",
        "Hey now! That was an accident, okay.",
        "What’s a scrud?",
        "I don’t have too. I can just look at you.",
        "(to himself) Not nice enough.",
        "(to himself) Good for a scrud.",
        "That’s crap!! Sister Brown Bird. (to Elizabeth) Good going. (does the salute)",
        "Hi there!",
        "Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency.",
        "Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.",
        "Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you’re gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. (she glares at him) That’s not how that was supposed to come out.",
        "That word was swans.",
        "No.",
        "I’m, I’m sorry you didn’t get to go to Spacecamp, and I’m hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah Tuttle’s Private Very Special Spacecamp!! (opens the door and Chandler and Joey jump up, their apartment is decorated like outer space, one of the leather chairs is covered in tinfoil.)",
        "Oh come on! Here we go! (picks her up and puts her in the chair) Stand by for mission countdown!",
        "Oh no! An asteroid! (throws the soccer ball off the back of Joey’s head.)",
        "Halftime.",
        "What?",
        "Um, Monica and I aren’t supposed to play football.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.",
        "Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn’t count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.",
        "Oh yeah! Then how come you didn’t get the Geller Cup?",
        "Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, ‘nobody won that game, ‘ and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... (pauses to collect himself, as he is on the verge of tears saying this) threw it in the lake.",
        "Anyway. That’s when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.",
        "Can I see you for a second?",
        "All right, we’re gonna play.",
        "Here you go. (throws her the ball)",
        "(holding both of their hands above their heads making rabbit ears with their fingers.) Bunny!",
        "Sweetie, don’t worry you’ll get picked. Chandler.",
        "Sweetie, now I pick you.",
        "Okay. All right. So let’s see, let’s play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we’ll kick off.",
        "Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!",
        "Come on, let’s go!",
        "Yeah, losers talk!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Okay, (to Chandler) this play, I want you to do a down and out to the right. Okay. Break!",
        "You, you go long.",
        "Until we start to look very small.",
        "Break!!",
        "One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!",
        "Uh, hello, it’s third down.",
        "Wow!",
        "It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.",
        "Okay, it’s second down. (turns away) Take all the second downs you need.",
        "Well, I said it loud.",
        "Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie..",
        "Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Okay. Hut! Hike!",
        "Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn’t count.",
        "Before the snap!",
        "Oh Pheebs, that’s great. It doesn’t count.",
        "Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.",
        "Oh-ho, okay.",
        "Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.",
        "Okay, first of all, I don’t play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!",
        "Oh really! Why is that?",
        "The Geller Cup.",
        "Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!",
        "That cup is mine!",
        "Chandler! Chandler!",
        "Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What’s with the tackling?",
        "Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough.",
        "Hey, where’d you get that?",
        "It’s no surprise that your winning, ‘cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.",
        "What?! The guys against the girls? See, that’s ridiculous Monica, because I’m only down by three touchdowns.",
        "Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you’re with me.",
        "Right. Okay, let’s play. Let’s go.",
        "Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let’s play some ball, guys.",
        "Okay, y'know what, let’s just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?",
        "Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...",
        "Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.",
        "Hey! It’s 42-21!",
        "Let go! Let go!",
        "No! You let go!",
        "How come it’s always us left in the field holding the ball?",
        "Hey! It’s starting to snow.",
        "Gimme the this!",
        "Neither will I. (they both put back the brownies.)",
        "So what’s a matter, you need a dentist? I’ve got a good one.",
        "Why? Why can’t you go to him?",
        "Pheebs, come on, you didn’t kill anybody, these people just\n      happened to die when you went to the dentist. It’s, it’s, it’s\n      just ah, a coincidence.",
        "Thanks, Gunther. (takes the plate Gunther serves him and\n      Rachel comes up and kisses him) (to Rachel) Hey! (to Gunther)\n      Umm, can I get a napkin too?",
        "(patting his clothes like he is looking for his wallet) No, no he’s\n      not.",
        "What? (to Joey) So what are you going to do? I mean how,\n      how are you going to tell Chandler?",
        "Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few\n      hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.",
        "Well, they painted over the word ‘Sapien’ for one thing, then\n      they rearranged the figures, let’s just leave it at that.",
        "Yes, that’s what I was going to ask, thank you.",
        "You? You! Want to watch Ben? (in the background Monica\n      mouths ‘Don’t worry, I’ll be here the whole time.’ to Ross.) Yes!\n      That’d be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know\n      how empty her life is. (Monica sarcastically mouths ‘Yeah!’ and\n      holds up her thumb.)",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hmm?",
        "Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.",
        "(entering) Hey! Everyone.",
        "How’s my little boy?",
        "(noticing the outfit he is wearing) What’d you do, take him\n      whaling?",
        "Oh my God, he just said your name, that’s great! Good job\n      Ben.",
        "And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time\n      isn’t moving.",
        "Well, he’s finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?",
        "It’s okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the\n      time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you\n      did the best you could.",
        "I know! I’m saying you have to watch them all the time.",
        "Monica did it?",
        "Monica?",
        "Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?",
        "Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing\n      the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but\n      suddenly he’s leaving out ‘e’ and ‘f.’ It’s like they just ah,\n      I don’t know, fell out of his head.",
        "Oh, and also, he’s, he’s walkin’ kind of funny, his left leg is\n      moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he’s in there just\n      sort of y'know... (walks around in a circle) ",
        "Monica bang! Monica bang! (runs into one of the posts) Ow!",
        "Can we please focus here, a naked man’s life hangs in the\n      balance!",
        "He does not look happy.",
        "Real magic does exist.",
        "Ah, somebody’s at the door on the ceiling.",
        "Hey Chandler, there’s a party tomorrow, you’ll feel better then.",
        "Oh, somebody’s feeling better.",
        "Hi!",
        "Wow!",
        "What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?",
        "And he’s, he’s a total stranger?",
        "Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some s*x.",
        "Well, I’m just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.",
        "Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?",
        "Thank you. (to Rachel) So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Hi.",
        "Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.",
        "Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.",
        "That’s excellent.",
        "(to Rachel) So, he’s just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn’t want anything in exchange for helping him?",
        "Yeah.",
        "(to Rachel) You see what men do! Don’t tell me men are not nice! (points to Chandler) This is men!!",
        "Which one is Gina?",
        "That’s okay.",
        "Hey, Joey.",
        "Ah, which, which one?",
        "Mary-Angela.",
        "Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How’s it going. This is the hardest letter I’ve ever had to write. (to Chandler) What the hell’s a matter with you? How do you think Joey’s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?",
        "All right, look, look, you’ve got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.",
        "Where in Cuba?",
        "Bummer.",
        "No, I’m genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn’t work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.",
        "But, you, you don’t want to seem too pushy.",
        "(to Rachel, as she gets his number) What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home?",
        "That’s right good things, that-that is what I said. (glances at Monica)",
        "That is so made up!",
        "There you go.",
        "Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I’d expect nothing less.",
        "High collar and baggy pants say I’m a pro.",
        "You go get ‘em. (to Monica) What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way?",
        "‘Why don’t you call him?!’ Well, thank you very much! Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!",
        "Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.",
        "No.",
        "Well, yeah!",
        "(shyly) You grow up.",
        "Hi!",
        "Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I... (gives her a flower)",
        "Hi. (kisses her)",
        "How’d did it go?",
        "I’m so proud of you.",
        "Listen, I’m ah, I’m sorry I’ve been so crazy and jealous and, it’s just that I like you a lot, so...",
        "Yeah.",
        "Congratu!! (sees her hug Mark) -lations-lations.",
        "Maybe he’s just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?",
        "Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?",
        "Ah, we’ll all go. (motions to Chandler) Come on. (the guys leave)",
        "(to Chandler) It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!",
        "Why?",
        "Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.",
        "Hmm? Oh, yeah. (he makes a growling sound)",
        "Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?",
        "Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?",
        "What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?",
        "She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, (to Joey) he's really good looking. (Joey gives an enthusiastic thumbs up) What am I gonna do?",
        "Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities.",
        "Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em.",
        "(on phone) Hi, is Rachel there?",
        "This is Ross?",
        "Of Ross and Rachel.",
        "Oh hey, hey Mark.",
        "Okay.",
        "Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone?",
        "Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in his own office?",
        "Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she?",
        "What?",
        "Okay, bye-bye. (starts slamming the receiver down in anger.)",
        "Oh, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry sweetie, I was just trying to ah, I'm dialing another number. (hangs up)",
        "It's from Ross, it's a love bug.",
        "I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt!",
        "I mean my God...",
        "...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!!",
        "I would never do that!",
        "Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot.",
        "Why?! How?! How is he a genius?",
        "What am I going to do?",
        "I don't know you guys.",
        "All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!",
        "What's going on?! (throws the love bug at him) That's what's going on!!",
        "I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! What do I have to do to get some service?! (turns to Rachel) Hi Rach. (He's puts his hand on her shoulder and she knocks it away.)",
        "(entering) Hi.",
        "(sits down next to her) I'm sorry, I was an idiot.",
        "A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.",
        "Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.",
        "I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.",
        "Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.",
        "Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?",
        "Ahh, no.",
        "Are you jealous?",
        "You are totally jealous.",
        "Honey, I love you too.",
        "What?",
        "Huh.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "No thanks. I’m 29.",
        "Oh sweetie, when do you think you’re going to get off tonight?",
        "Oh come on, not again.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.",
        "And what are you going to do for him?",
        "Okay.",
        "So, are you gonna see him again?",
        "Naked friends.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh.",
        "Yeah, make that three.",
        "Okay. (goes over to the counter) (to Chandler) What ah, what is the matter with you? What’s going on?",
        "What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay?",
        "What?!",
        "Are you sure? (Chandler nods: Yes!) Hold on. (walks over behind the couch) I’m sorry you guys, that was a coffee and a....",
        "Okay.",
        "No, no, that won’t be ah, that won’t be necessary (leans down and looks up Robert’s shorts, seeing Robert’s package.)",
        "Yeah, yeah, yeah!",
        "Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.",
        "Umm, Jo’s a girl, it’s short for Josephine.",
        "Hey! How’d the ah, basketball go?",
        "Calm down. There’s no reason to get testy.",
        "Good.",
        "Joey’s asking if you’ve just ruined the first book he’s ever loved that didn’t star Jack Nicholson?",
        "Oh.",
        "He’s right, even if it’s to say something complementary. (He stops and thinks about what he just said.)",
        "(to Chandler) Hey, don’t we have to...",
        "Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, she’s more..(shakes his shoulders, like he’s dancing) y'know, and you’re more (sees the look from Phoebe and stops)",
        "Hi.",
        "Hello.",
        "Yeah, huh.",
        "What?",
        "Come on sweetie! You’ve had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?",
        "(to Rachel) But work comes first! (to Mark) Oh hey, but that’s sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?",
        "Oh well that’s great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh? (picks a pad up off Rachel’s desk and tosses it into his box) Good bye.",
        "Okay.",
        "Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying ‘I’ll see you Saturday.’",
        "Oh, no, no, no, it’s-it’s not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....",
        "Oh, well...",
        "Well, I’m sorry, but ah, look if you’re not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?",
        "Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...",
        "Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?",
        "Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.",
        "Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.",
        "What should I wear, now I’m all nervous.",
        "(to Rachel) I’m really glad we came. (Rachel smiles and rubs his arm) You’re so pretty. I love you.",
        "(entering) So I nodded off a little.",
        "Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.",
        "First of all it’s Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn’t fly.",
        "Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.",
        "No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island. (Makes an unusual sound, then he realises that he still has his jacket on and quickly tries to shake it off, thinking it’s alive and attacking him.)",
        "No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don’t know, I feel like lately, I feel like you’re slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you’ve got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it’s dumb, but I hate that I’m not a part of it.",
        "That’s a little clearer.",
        "Sure, I-I-I... (hugs her and mouths No!!)",
        "Is everything okay?",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "What is ah, Rach in her room?",
        "Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn’t she know it’s our anniversary?",
        "What’s that on the bottom?",
        "Hey, honey.",
        "Hey, what’s going on?",
        "What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?",
        "(entering, carrying a basket) Hi!",
        "Well you said you couldn’t go out so.... (pulls the cover off of the basket)",
        "Yeah, but I got cous-cous!",
        "Okay, you don’t have to stop, I’m invisible, I’m not here. (lights a candle)",
        "Yeah!!",
        "(stopping grinding) Pepper?",
        "Okay sorry, whew.",
        "(putting out the fire with a squeeze bottle of water) Okay, that’s a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.",
        "I’m sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebody’s off the phone, how ‘bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.",
        "Come on Rach, you don’t have what, ten minutes?",
        "What? (to Sophie) Sophie, does she have ten minutes?",
        "Don’t yell at me okay, this is the most I’ve seen you all week.",
        "Yeah, but wait...",
        "Hey.",
        "No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.",
        "For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?",
        "Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.",
        "Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.",
        "No, but it’d be nice if you realised, it’s just a job!",
        "Yes.",
        "No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I’m happy for ya, but I’m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don’t know what to do anymore.",
        "Is this about Mark?",
        "Okay, it’s not, it’s not.",
        "Oh I’m, I’m making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.",
        "Okay, okay, fine, you’re right. Let’s ah, let’s take a break, (goes to the door) let’s cool off, okay, let’s get some frozen yogart, or something.. (opens the door)",
        "Oh, hi Chloe.",
        "Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we’re gonna break-up instead.",
        "What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.",
        "Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don’t I have to wait a while?",
        "Hi! It’s me.",
        "Really? I’ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don’t, don’t you think we can work on this?",
        "Who’s that?",
        "Is that Mark?",
        "Yeah! Got it! (slams the phone down, and walks back to the bar.)",
        "Ah, that’s okay, thanks.",
        "Look, I don’t feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?",
        "(to Chloe) I like this song.",
        "Oh, no, no.",
        "I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.",
        "Is this about Mark?",
        "Okay, it’s not, it’s not.",
        "Fine, you’re right. Let’s ah, let’s take a break, (goes to the door) let’s cool off, okay, let’s get some frozen yoghurt, or something.. (opens the door)",
        "(on the phone) I’ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don’t, don’t you think we can work on this?",
        "Who’s that?",
        "Is that Mark?",
        "Yeah! Got it! (slams down the phone)",
        "Yeah!!",
        "Na-huh.",
        "I love you.",
        "Okay. (Ross starts frantically looking for a clock.)",
        "Chloe, Chloe how’s it coming?!!",
        "Umm, oh, hey, I don’t know. How about a big one?",
        "Well then a small one!! Listen, let’s, we kinda have to get going!",
        "You, you sure you need shoes? (Chloe nods her head) Okay. (reaches down and picks up a shoe)",
        "Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? (He’s frantically throwing the cushions off of the couch looking for her other shoe) Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yes, yes I am, one of the many things I’m feeling. Well.... (picks up her coat)",
        "Oh, thank you. (She goes to kiss him, but he holds her coat up between their faces to stop her.) Hey, hey. (opens the door, sees Rachel, and hides Chloe behind the door) Rachel!!!!",
        "Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.",
        "Yes, you can, very much.",
        "(seeing the thumbs up) Ahhhh!! (Hugs Rachel tighter.)",
        "You think?! God, I, ah, I’m in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel’s all like, ‘I love you and, and let’s work on this.’ And all I can think about is, ‘What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?’ when I tell her what I did.",
        "What?! Look, we’re trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?",
        "Yeah, but don’t you think....",
        "Yeah, okay. (he plops down into one of the leather chairs, with the footrest extended.)",
        "What trail?",
        "Oh, I-I don’t think there’s any trail.",
        "(entering) Chloe? Hi..",
        "You took my watch?",
        "Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?",
        "Exactly. So you didn’t, didn’t mention anything to Issac right?",
        "You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven’t actually met...",
        "Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.",
        "Yeah, that’s the one. Listen, I don’t want to hurt her.",
        "Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?",
        "Actually, no, we’re not.",
        "No, we’re not.",
        "No, we’re not!!",
        "Right.",
        "Fine. I just need to know that you’re not gonna tell your sister.",
        "(entering out of breath) Jasmine?",
        "We met at Phoebe’s birthday party, I’m, I’m Ross Geller.",
        "Yes, I did.",
        "Very bad.",
        "I’m agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?",
        "Okay, Jasmine, please, please don’t. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?",
        "Thank you, thank you.",
        "(angrily) Who’s your roommate?",
        "Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn’t say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.",
        "(forcing the door open) Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!",
        "Rachel?",
        "No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?",
        "No!!",
        "No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.",
        "What?",
        "She was...",
        "She, she was different.",
        "Nobody likes change.",
        "What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.",
        "I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.",
        "Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!",
        "Look, I didn’t think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.",
        "That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.",
        "Look, I’m not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!",
        "Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn’t happen!",
        "Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.",
        "Don’t you realise none of this would’ve ever happened if I didn’t think at that same moment you weren’t having s*x with Mark?",
        "(pause) Yes I would.",
        "(less sure) Yes.",
        "(covering his ears and screaming) La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it’s, I mean it’s you.",
        "What? Come on Rach, tell me what you’re thinking?",
        "Order a pizza like, ‘I forgive you?’",
        "Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I’m kinda hungry myself.",
        "No anchovies.",
        "That’s okay, I’ll just pick ‘em off.",
        "You can have the last piece, if you want.",
        "What, now you’re not even taking to me? (moves over to the coffee table) Look Rachel, I-I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I’d lost you, I didn’t know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don’t cheat right, I, that’s not me, I’m not Joey!",
        "Y'know what, y'know what, I’m-I’m not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You’re the one that bailed on us. You’re the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!",
        "That’s what?!",
        "Okay, well here we are. Now we’re in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? (sits down next to her) Look, I, (on the verge of tears) I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I’m sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can’t. (We see Monica and Phoebe are almost in tears.) I just can’t see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.",
        "Okay, okay, okay.",
        "What?",
        "(moving over to stand in front of her) Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn’t work past it together...",
        "Look, look, there’s got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, (takes a hold of one of her arms.) I can’t imagine, I can’t imagine my life without you. (Both of them are starting to cry.) Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, (drops to his knees and hugs her around her waist) and, and....",
        "(crying) Yeah, but this can’t be it, I mean.",
        "Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It’s been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.",
        "Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? (in an Irish accent) Two days of darts, it’ll be great!",
        "No, no, no, this weekend guys!",
        "What’s going on?",
        "So, for the whole weekend?",
        "Yeah, that’s okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I’m alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.",
        "What a pity stay?",
        "Pity food? Y'know what that’s okay, all right, I don’t need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home?",
        "Where’s Ben?",
        "Ahh. (notices the table) Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?",
        "Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?",
        "Ah! (realises) Oh.",
        "Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. ‘Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.",
        "Yeah, well.",
        "Oh yeah, I’d love that.",
        "I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job. (he sits down at the table.)",
        "....right? Right? I mean it’s pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don’t, I don’t need them, huh, I’ve got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.",
        "(looking at the page) 717? (to Carol) Where’s 717? (He gets up to return the page, Carol starts to take the last of the food into the kitchen, but Ross grabs the last piece.) Hey, you’ve have more of these for Susan right?",
        "Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?",
        "Oh, now you want a favour?",
        "Well, oh, I’m sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I’m a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?",
        "No, I’m not gonna pick them up.",
        "No, Rachel doesn’t want me to....",
        "Yeah, you’re right.",
        "We were on a break!!! Okay!! (grabs the phone) We were, we were..., (calms down) yeah. Where are you? I’ll find you. (hangs up)",
        "Oh, you-you’re-you’re one to talk.",
        "He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I’m stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I’ve got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.",
        "Excuse me?",
        "(sarcastic) Oh please, can’t I come to your special, magical cabin?",
        "Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.",
        "All right Pheebs, your cab’s ready.",
        "You’re welcome.",
        "We were on a break!",
        "Hey-hey, it’s valid okay? And I’m not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me.",
        "That’s what you said last night.",
        "Okay.",
        "Obviously not to Joey.",
        "(to Rachel) Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.",
        "I can.",
        "Look, you guys, you guys should go. (Joey tries to say something, but Ross cuts him off.) No, I’m, you, you planned this all out, and I don’t want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.",
        "No, no, really, I’ve got to take the car back anyway, I’m spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It’s fine, no guilt I promise.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay.",
        "That would be great.",
        "I know!",
        "(entering) Hi! Sorry I’m late. Were you sleeping?",
        "Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could, ‘cause that’s not where you want to skimp.",
        "Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?",
        "Okay.",
        "So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?",
        "(outside the door) So I’m gonna take off then!",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.",
        "We were all pretty shaken up about it.",
        "Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.",
        "You get the dollhouse.",
        "Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.",
        "Sure, what’s up?",
        "I-I know. Well if something comes up... (walks away)",
        "Uh, Pheebs, while we’re hovering around the subject. I just have to say dinosaurs, they-they don’t go, rrroof!",
        "Hey, what’s this?!",
        "This is the coolest house ever!!",
        "I would!",
        "Hi.",
        "Hi.",
        "It’s a little early to be drinkin’.",
        "Ohhhhh!",
        "Mon?",
        "Oh, fire! There, there’s a fire! Fire!!",
        "Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, we believe it originated here. (He uses a pointer and points to the point of origin.) In the Aroma Room.",
        "No Phoebe, don’t look! You don’t want to see what’s under there!!",
        "Pffhah.",
        "Nothing, it’s just that hypnosis is beyond crap.",
        "Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.",
        "Here you go.",
        "Sorry. (To remedy that, Ross scoops the cinnamon off of the top with his hand.)",
        "Exactly, it’ll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.",
        "And so now you guys are gonna be married?",
        "Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?",
        "Pheebs, if you don’t tell him, soon he’s gonna be married, and then you’re gonna hate yourself.",
        "All we’re saying is don’t rush into anything.",
        "Yeah, he-he’s right, he’s right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you’re young, you’re-you’re weird, chicks dig that.",
        "No the man’s right, that’s what I had with Rachel.",
        "No, I ah, I slept with someone else.",
        "It didn’t.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "Don’t ask me, I had it and I blew it!",
        "Oh, no! No!",
        "I’m the ring bearer.",
        "Hi!",
        "Hey, how’d the date go with Mr. Millionaire?",
        "Still?!",
        "I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.",
        "(entering) Hello.",
        "So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.",
        "Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.",
        "Then be supportive like a guy.",
        "Hi.",
        "You ah, wanted to see me?",
        "What?!",
        "What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes, I do.",
        "Yeah, I-I really do. (takes a dinosaur mug out of the box) Hey! This-this was a gift?!",
        "It’s still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!",
        "No!! Y'know-y'know don’t do me any favours. In fact, where, where’s the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, (picks up a book) Hey, this book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I’d like that back too. Yes, I do.",
        "I’m just trying to help you, move on.",
        "Petty...",
        "Petty...",
        "Petty...",
        "Small... (Rachel comes back into the living room and catches Ross mocking her.)",
        "Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!",
        "I’m-I’m gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!! (he kisses the shirt)",
        "Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...",
        "Oh-oh, okay, okay! (He quickly takes off his sweater in order to put on the T-shirt. It’s an old ‘Frankie says relax’ T-shirt, that barely fits him. Rachel nods her head in approval of the new look.) If you don’t mind I’m gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. (Starts to leave) You have a pleasant evening. (He exits and leaves the door open.)",
        "You bug me.",
        "I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she’d say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!",
        "Hey, it’s been like three weeks!",
        "Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I’m gonna kill myself, I swear. I can’t, I can’t watch this. (turns away, then quickly turns to look again) Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she’s going in.",
        "She’s going in. Wait! He’s going in! He’s going in!! The door’s closed! I, I can’t see anything but the door closed!!",
        "Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!",
        "I don’t know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I’ll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!",
        "Look, they must be stopped!",
        "I need juice! People need juice!!",
        "People need juice!",
        "Juice, I need...",
        "Yeah, okay.",
        "It’s just I miss her so much.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "(triumphantly) I’m gonna be on TV!!",
        "Yeah! They’re putting together this panel to talk about these\n      fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel’s\n      gonna film it!",
        "Thanks. You ready to go?",
        "(entering, wearing a white suit with a little red bow tie) Hey,\n      you guys! Guess what?",
        "Y'know what I didn’t wear this suit for a year because you hated\n      it. Well, guess what? You’re not my girlfriend anymore so...",
        "Right.",
        "(to Monica) You like it right?",
        "Okay, good bye! (leaves)",
        "(entering carrying a garment bag) Hey!",
        "(sees the chick) Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV\n      thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you\n      think? (takes out two suits) This blue suit, or this brown one?",
        "Really? (Joey gives him a ‘Like I would know’ look)",
        "Wow! That aspirin dance really works!",
        "Oh my God, is that still...",
        "No you’re not.",
        "Rach!",
        "(stopping her from falling) Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go\n      to a doctor! Okay?",
        "And I’m sure you’re gonna make a big impression. Hi! I’m Rachel\n      Green. It’s nice to meet you. (He lifts his leg and imitates\n      shaking hands with it, just like how Rachel was trying to pick\n      up the aspirin with her feet.) Come on, you probably have a\n      broken rib!",
        "Rach...",
        "Rachel...",
        "Fine. I’ll go.",
        "(He checks his watch) Sure. I’ll help you.",
        "Ohh. (He drops the shoes, takes the brush from her, and licks\n      the tip. He doesn’t like how it tastes.)",
        "Okay. This stuff? ",
        "All right.",
        "Oke-dokey. (He pokes her in the eye with the brush.)",
        "Sorry.",
        "Sorry, I’m sorry. Close, close, close...",
        "I’m sweeping...",
        "Sweep, sweep....(He starts to paint it on her eye, making it\n      look like she has a black eye.)",
        "What? What?",
        "No. No, y'know you don’t, you don’t wear enough of this. (Rachel\n      is shocked) What?",
        "Well I, close your eyes, I just think you’re gonna like this a\n      little better, ‘cause, close-close... (He gets some more on the\n      brush)",
        "(blows it) Sorry. ‘Cause umm, I think this will make you a\n      little more sophisticated.",
        "There you go! Good enough for your party, huh?",
        "Yep?",
        "Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party.\n      Okay?",
        "(checks his watch) Sure, okay.",
        "What?",
        "Rachel, I’ve seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off\n      you naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your\n      belly button?",
        "Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.",
        "All I have to do is close my eyes. See? (closes his eyes) Woo-hoo!!",
        "Ah, I’m sorry.",
        "Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It’s one of my ah,\n      rights as the ex-boyfriend. (closes his eyes again) Oop, oh yeah!",
        "Okay, okay, I’m sorry, it will never happen... (closes eyes)\n      Uh-oh! Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you\n      and I’m the king. ",
        "Come on, would you grow up? It’s no big deal.",
        "Yowzah!!!",
        "Aww, come on.",
        "Oh my God!",
        "All right.",
        "Look...",
        "Okay.",
        "Rach?",
        "Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay, I’m gonna get your coat and then I’ll-I’ll put you in a\n      cab.",
        "(He thinks about it) Of course I am. I just have to make a call.",
        "Okay? (goes into the living room)",
        "(rushing back in) What?! I wh-, what’s wrong?",
        "Rach, you can’t look fat in an x-ray.",
        "(to Chandler) That’s a duck.",
        "Oh, it was, nah, well....",
        "Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on. (they\n      go into her apartment) Easy.",
        "I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery\n      Channel.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Eh, ‘cause I knew that if I told you, you’d make me go, and I\n      knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on. Come on.",
        "What?",
        "(breaking the silence) You should get some sleep.",
        "So, I’ll umm...",
        "No, that’s, no, as long as you’re okay. So I’ll ah, I’ll see you\n      tomorrow.",
        "What happened?",
        "Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.",
        "Huh, what’s fish hooking... (Joey sticks his finger in Ross’s mouth and pulls on his cheek, y'know like when you hook a fish.) (to Joey, sarcastic) Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?",
        "(on phone) That’s right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. (listens) Thank you. (hangs up) (to the gang) Yeah, we have the reservations.",
        "(stunned) Dude, what are you doing?",
        "All right so, Chandler, from now on, don’t give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don’t turn your back to him.",
        "(walking up with this huge tub-o-popcorn and drink) Hey!",
        "Yeah, it’s the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!",
        "Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.",
        "All right! You go get him! Let’s go!",
        "Hey! How long until Pete’s fight?",
        "Hot dog?",
        "What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn’t expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn’t expecting to like anyone right now, but she’s really terrific.",
        "No, I-I’m saying I liked her.",
        "Pheebs, I think she’s great. Okay? We’re going out again.",
        "Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.",
        "Okay, we’ll be right in. (to Chandler) So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?",
        "Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn’t want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can’t.",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something.",
        "No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.",
        "Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out. (starts to take off his pants)",
        "Come on you guys, it's no big deal! (He turns around and shows him his thing.)",
        "Well what is it? Is it a mole? (He moves closer to them, and they jump back.)",
        "Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?",
        "Ahhh.",
        "(entering) Hey guys!",
        "Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign.",
        "He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.",
        "At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name.",
        "(sarcastic) Yeah, that'd be cool!",
        "Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!",
        "Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.",
        "No?",
        "Well then, what is it?!",
        "Y'know I have dinner plans!!",
        "Yes, and the dimmer switch.",
        "Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom!",
        "Monica’s right. We’re talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can’t just rush into this.",
        "Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don’t want to make it savory.",
        "Gimme this. (Grabs the herbalist’s card and leaves.)",
        "Hi.",
        "Listen, I got to tell you I’ve-I’ve never been to a guru before, so...",
        "What’s a koondis?",
        "I guess it’s worth a try.",
        "What?! What?!",
        "We?! We angered it?!",
        "Oh God!",
        "Ow!!",
        "What was, what was that?",
        "What?! How’s that?",
        "Hey! (congratulates him)",
        "Uh, yeah, I ah, I also need two.",
        "Uh, no, it’s-it’s just this person.",
        "Yeah, kinda. It’s this woman from work. I hope that won’t be too weird. Will it, Rach?",
        "All right, I’ll see you tonight.",
        "Hey, hey Rach!",
        "Hi!",
        "Good.",
        "So it’s looks like we’re the first ones here.",
        "Yay!!",
        "Hey. Oh, I’m sorry, this is Cailin.",
        "And! Break!!",
        "Okay. (The girls leave.) (to Tommy) So uh, well, this-this is uh, this is awkward.",
        "Well y'know ‘cause Rachel and I used to go out.",
        "Oh! Well then this is awkward. So what do you uh…",
        "Oh! Yeah.",
        "Okay. (sees two people sitting in their seats.) Uh, huh. Excuse me, I’m sorry, I-I think you may be in our seats.",
        "(looking at ticket) Yep! Yeah, see this says D-13, and uh…",
        "No, I’m good. (He sits down, stunned.)",
        "(drags Chandler over to buffet table) I’m telling you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think he’s baaad news!",
        "Hi! Yeah! Tommy’s in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in front of him, I think he’s gonna snap. (He’s watching very intently)",
        "Go? Why?",
        "But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream.",
        "Uh, oh-ho bye.",
        "One.",
        "Look. Look, I wasn’t going to say anything to you, but... All right, I don’t think you should be seeing Tommy anymore.",
        "No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him.",
        "No, it’s not just ‘cause I’m jealous. (Both Monica and Chandler give him a ‘Come on’ look) I mean I’m not, I’m not, I’m not jealous, okay? It’s… Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.",
        "Okay, fine, fine. You don’t want to believe me? No, that’s fine. (starts to leave)",
        "You don’t want to believe me, I’m Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny… (turns around and almost spills his coffee on Tommy)",
        "Whoa, sorry Tommy.",
        "Umm…",
        "Okay, it’s coffee.",
        "It’s-it’s hot…",
        "(coming out of the kitchen with a cup of coffee, almost running into Tommy) Oh-ho, whoa! Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled this hot coffee on you.",
        "No, but it’s-it’s-it’s hot!",
        "I can’t believe no one believes me!",
        "You do Pheebs?",
        "Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah.",
        "That’s too bad.",
        "Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?",
        "Yeah, I think she looks good.",
        "Go, go, go!",
        "Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.",
        "No-o-o! (Rachel gives him a \"Please?\" look.) No way! ",
        "Yeah well, if ah, if that’s the rule this weekend... (She gets\n      up) No!",
        "Get away!",
        "Stay away!",
        "(he gets up and starts to run away from her) No! (in his escape\n      attempt he crushes Chandler’s sand castle) No!",
        "Ow! Ow! Oh, no-no-no!",
        "Hey!",
        "Okay, (reading the card) Fonzy gives you two thumbs up, collect\n      two cool points. Yeah.",
        "Okay, come on! (blows on the dice) Daddy needs a new pair of\n      electromagnetic microscopes for the Prehistoric Forensics\n      Department! (They all look at him, and he shuts up and rolls\n      the dice.) (he moves his piece) Okay. (reading a card) Take\n      Pinky Tuscadero up to Inspiration Point, collect three cool\n      points!! Yeah! Which gives me five, and let’s see who is gonna\n      lose their clothes. Ummmm, I think I pick our strip poker\n      sponsor Mr. Joey Tribianni.",
        "Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?",
        "Okay.",
        "Hey! (Rachel is shocked) Hi Bonnie!",
        "Oh.",
        "Good morning.",
        "(to Joey) Good morning. Nice breasts by the way.",
        "Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.",
        "Wh-haa-haa! Look what ‘cha did! (Rachel has her hand over her\n      mouth to keep from laughing.)",
        "Nooo, but it, but it’s great.",
        "Okay. (He gently touches it.) You can feel all the bones in\n      your skull.",
        "Hi.",
        "I was having a little chat with ah, Bonnie, and ah, guess what,\n      she-she happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um,\n      whole head shaving idea, and now, who was it? Oh, that’s right,\n      that’s right, it was you!",
        "She said you gave her the razor!",
        "Ahh, no, I’m good.",
        "Okay, have fun! Wooo!!",
        "You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head! What the hell\n      were you thinking?!!",
        "You don’t know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!",
        "Y'know, hey! You’re the one who ended it, remember?",
        "You still love me?",
        "You still love me.",
        "Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you\n      wanna, get back together?",
        "What?!",
        "What?",
        "That’s not true! Her, she doesn’t even know what she wants!\n      Rachel’s still mad about the whole thing.",
        "I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that\n      kiss!",
        "Good night.",
        "Okey-dokey!",
        "Hey, it’ll grow back, right? And she-she’s really fun, and she’s\n      cool, and-and I’m finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over\n      Rachel was so (makes an incoherent nasal sound), y'know? Y'know,\n      and I’m finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there,\n      and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her, and-and-and it\n      doesn’t work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through\n      that again?",
        "Yeah.",
        "(entering the bedroom) Hi. (closes the door)",
        "Who’s Chip?",
        "The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?",
        "Monica, you’re so lucky! He’s like the most popular guy in school!!",
        "(to Rachel) I was just leaving.",
        "Why? Did you write it?",
        "Well ah, actually...",
        "Well, umm, why don’t you give him a call?",
        "Oh, I’m sure.",
        "(whispering in her ear) Oh, that’s right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that’s gotta be embarrassing! ",
        "(reading the newspaper) Hey, here’s a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?",
        "I’m reading your ad.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Good, so do I",
        "Are you sure she’s in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma’s glycoma medicine again?",
        "So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?",
        "So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?",
        "So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe’s mom remind anyone of a cat?",
        "Come on, you-you can’t tell me you actually believe that-that there’s a woman inside that cat!",
        "No you don’t. ",
        "No you do--y'know what, you’re not gonna suck me into this.",
        "I do not always have to be--okay, okay. (starts to leave)",
        "(taking the flyer) Apparently Phoebe’s mother also goes by the name Julio.",
        "Yes, we have to tell her!",
        "(holds up a hand) Little girl misses her cat. (hold up the other hand) Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. (gets up) Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.",
        "Thank you.",
        "(entering) Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?",
        "(seeing Phoebe still with cat) You didn’t tell her?! (They all kinda shy away.) Okay, fine! Pheebs?",
        "Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place.",
        "No! No! Look--Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!",
        "None.",
        "I’m sorry.",
        "I don’t know what to say.",
        "(goes over to Julio) Come here, here, come here, come here, (pause) Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend’s mother.",
        "Oh! Y'know, I’ve got an extra futon.",
        "So why don’t you quit?",
        "Who is Maria?",
        "You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?",
        "So you’re strong enough to face her on your own?",
        "They make you take an oath?",
        "Then how do you explain the toe ring?!",
        "Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.",
        "One more time, \"Hey, don’t you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?\"",
        "Good! That’s good!",
        "Me? No.",
        "It’s okay man, be strong. (Chandler goes into the office.)",
        "No! And I’m not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.",
        "And that’s funny, why?",
        "Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.",
        "And that’s not against your oath?!",
        "Hello.",
        "We’d like to close our accounts.",
        "No-no.",
        "No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.",
        "Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don’t think Mom would’ve hired you if she didn’t think you were good at what you do.",
        "…I’m telling you it’s totally unconstituional.",
        "Hey!",
        "The volcano?",
        "With such a sad history.",
        "(surprised) Hi!",
        "Awww.",
        "Yeah. (closes the door, and goes over and kisses Rachel.)",
        "I know.",
        "(stopping suddenly and getting up) Okay, I gotta go.",
        "Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.",
        "Well, yeah. I can’t-I can’t stay here all night, and if I go in there she’s-she’s gonna wanna... do stuff.",
        "No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn’t work either, I can’t tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...",
        "Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?",
        "Yeah, yeah. (opens the door) It wasn’t every morning.",
        "Okay.",
        "It’s over.",
        "Well, it was loong. I didn’t even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o’clock shadow on her head. (They both start to laugh, then stop themselves quickly.) Anyway, she didn’t want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.",
        "Ohh! Thank you! I like mail. (He goes to kiss her again, but she turns away.)",
        "Okay. (He leans in to kiss her again, but she leans back preventing him from making contact.) Wow, it’s-it’s 5:30 in the morning. (Rachel laughs) So, I’d better get cracking on this baby.",
        "Okay, I’ll be up in, (looks at the letter) 18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.",
        "Oh. (looks at his watch) Oh-oh. (takes a drink of coffee and resumes reading the letter)",
        "Done!",
        "Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!",
        "I’m sorry.",
        "Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole ‘Does it?’ part just another glance.",
        "(interrupting) No, Rach, no. I don’t, I don’t, I don’t have to think about it, in fact, I’ve decided, I’ve decided that, that it.......does.",
        "Oh, sure! I’m sure.",
        "Hey!",
        "What happened?",
        "It does. It really and truly does.",
        "(finding the part) (looks up in disgust) It so does not!!!",
        "She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her! (Both Joey and Chandler shrug their shoulders as to say ”Well...”) (yelling) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!",
        "Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here, (reading from the letter) “If you accept full responsibility...” (to Chandler and Joey) Full responsibility! “...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do. (yells at Joey) Does it?!!”",
        "(calming down) Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you’re right. Yeah I guess I’ll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.",
        "What the hell happened on that beach?!",
        "(coming back in with Rachel) Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?",
        "What happened? Joey?",
        "Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... (stops suddenly and turns to look at Monica) Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!",
        "I missed you too.",
        "(getting miffed) I suppose.",
        "(getting angry) Umm-hmm.",
        "(yelling from the bedroom) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!",
        "And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!",
        "I didn’t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn’t finish the whole letter!",
        "I fell asleep!",
        "It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! (they go into the living room, trapping Monica, Chandler, and Joey in the kitchen) (to Rachel) Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means ‘you are,’ Y-O-U-R means ‘your!’",
        "(starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind it)",
        "Oh, no-no-no don’t you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!",
        "You're welcome for a delicious dinner.",
        "I know!",
        "Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.",
        "I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.",
        "Fine by me; hope she wins.",
        "How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?",
        "So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?",
        "(moved by the kiss) Huh...",
        "Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?",
        "Mitzi is.....",
        "(mouths \"where?\") Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh (steps on some garbage and falters) ...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?",
        "Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh...",
        "Oh, yeah, why not?",
        "You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?",
        "Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! (Ross takes the loosely tied tie off and hands it to Joey who puts it on.) Here.",
        "What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.",
        "No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.",
        "I don't know. Soap?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, okay you're right.",
        "I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?",
        "It's, uh... it's endearing, really.",
        "(mustering up courage) Yes. Yes I do. (They go inside.)",
        "Department of Sanitation?",
        "Oh! (She kisses him) Ah. (They kiss more, and move down onto the couch. Ross's hand moves under some garbage) Aw! (His hand is covered with something brown and gooey.)",
        "(trying to make his disgust into lust) Ah, Cheryl!",
        "Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out.",
        "(picking up the slip of paper) Hello! What's this? Oh right its that girl's phone number. (Rachel ignores him) Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me. (He holds it so that Rachel can see it, she continues to ignore him) It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but...(Rachel still ignores him) Whoa! (Throws it in her lap) Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby! Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it. (He waves it in front of Rachel's face. Then suddenly Phoebe has to sneeze and Rachel quickly grabs the slip of paper and gives it to Phoebe for her to sneeze into.)",
        "Oh, mine's December...",
        "Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.",
        "(loudly) Good luck!",
        "Come on, Pheebs lay off him.",
        "Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "(loudly) So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!",
        "Oh.",
        "Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little \"playing\" ourselves.",
        "Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.",
        "Oh! (He bangs his fists together.)",
        "Monica knows.",
        "Well, I'm gonna go get ready, (Gives Monica the fist thing.) for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head.",
        "Hi!",
        "Wow! You-you look great!",
        "(she lets him in) Okay! (to her son) Hey Tommy.",
        "Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure.",
        "What?",
        "I-I-I...",
        "Who wants to make some long distance calls?",
        "Her date tipped me ten dollars. (Monica laughs)",
        "Pheebs, what are you doing?",
        "Are you serious?",
        "(entering) Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. (to Monica) So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?",
        "At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.",
        "You see Amanda and I have a very special...",
        "Fine.",
        "Here. (Hands her, her cough drops) (to Rachel) At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.",
        "Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?",
        "Who gets whom. (They all look at him.) I don’t know why I do that.",
        "Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!",
        "So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I’m already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.",
        "Really?! Wow! That’s-that’s so nice, what are you gonna get me?",
        "Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.",
        "Oh, that’s not true! I’ve got her lots of stuff she never took back.",
        "Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.",
        "Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh…",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Everything? Even the TV?",
        "Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don’t you think you could at least hear the guy out?",
        "That’s a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?",
        "You’ve sentenced him?!",
        "Joey, the guy’s your best friend.",
        "Oh, who? Me?",
        "Wow! I’m honored! And y’know what I’m gonna do as my first act as your best friend?",
        "I’m gonna get you to talk to Chandler.",
        "He’s coming here for Thanksgiving!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard’s son, you’d be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.",
        "(to Rachel) Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?",
        "I just wanna check something.",
        "(He puts his hand over the hole on the box.) (to Chandler) Now, we’ll see.",
        "(grabbing the necklace) The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver.",
        "Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!",
        "What did you get?",
        "Hey.",
        "Like ‘em, like ‘em? Or, I’d like to get store credit for that amount like ‘em?",
        "Sure! Oh, and Joey’s got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.",
        "There’s nothing the matter with me. See, I’m not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.",
        "I don’t know what to say, I’m sorry. Though, you’re not supposed to take these. (Points to the bone) It’s like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.",
        "He’s taking her purse!",
        "Y'know if we ever go to war and you’re captured, you’re in for a big surprise.",
        "Oh, you could just go uh, \"greatest of ease… (plays air guitar) BAH-bah-bha-bhannn.\" Then go right into it.",
        "Well umm, y’know, I used to play.",
        "Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that’s-that’s when I really found my sound.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven’t played in so long, and-and, well it’s-it’s really personal stuff, y’know?",
        "No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in—No, yeah, okay. (Runs out.)",
        "Okay, guys.",
        "Here we go. (Plays one note) Y’know, I’ve-I’ve never played my stuff for anyone before, so it’s important that-that you understand it’s about communicating very private emotions. (Plays another note) Y’know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That’s what I’m…",
        "Really?! I mean, really?!!",
        "Wow! Thanks, you guys. That’s uh—ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I’ll be right back! Okay? (Runs to fetch them) This is so nice, I’m—I am so… (starts to break up and leaves)",
        "(His voice is altered to sound like a computer.) Electrifying. (He plays the sound of a ticking clock.) Emphatic time-time-time…",
        "(with the altered voice) Thank you guys-guys-guys…",
        "(to Phoebe) Hey!",
        "Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don’t want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?",
        "Pheebs…",
        "See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y’know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I… I won’t play anymore.",
        "Yeah, okay.",
        "Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.",
        "What?",
        "No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would’ve just stepped aside.",
        "Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.",
        "Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.",
        "Thank you, thanks. (Sits down next to the girls) Yeah, I lost it. Y’know, I’m not gonna play anymore, (to Phoebe) would you, can you finish my set?",
        "Yeah, like I could lose it.",
        "I played bad on purpose guys.",
        "Yeah—no, just that last song.",
        "What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!",
        "I don’t know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there’s this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.",
        "Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?",
        "Dude, we are sooo gonna party!",
        "Mike \"Gandolf\" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world.",
        "I’m gonna call after you!",
        "Woooo!!!",
        "Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!",
        "Gandolf the wizard. (Joey is still confused) Hello! Didn’t you read Lord of the Rings in high school?",
        "(entering) Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!",
        "Whoa-whoa-whoa!",
        "Somewhere maybe along the equator?",
        "What happened?",
        "Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!",
        "It’s Gandolf, and he’s not coming.",
        "No! I balanced my checkbook.",
        "I can’t believe he didn’t come!",
        "Yeah! We’d meet, we’d meet total strangers, and hang out with them!",
        "There’s other stuff too.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yeah!!",
        "It’s not like we don’t know how to party!!",
        "Yeah!!!",
        "(to Chandler) Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Okay.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I’m kinda beat.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, me too.",
        "I’m just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y’know? I used them as mittens, I didn’t want to touch a thing in that last place.",
        "How sad are we?",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yeah!",
        "And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!",
        "Hey!",
        "I’m sorry I’m late, did I miss anything?",
        "15? (Joey nods again) Your personal best! (Ross takes an Oreo and Joey mumbles, no!)",
        "Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.",
        "Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she’d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.",
        "No, I’m getting back down ‘cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she’s like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.",
        "Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.",
        "You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?",
        "Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can’t decide between the two of them. Y’know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she’s a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y’know she’s, well she’s-she’s just as pretty, I guess she’s smart, she’s not fun.",
        "Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y’know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was—if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn’t kidding, she’s not fun, she’s stupid, and kind of a racist.",
        "Hey!",
        "I wasn’t sleeping.",
        "The one with the cat. I gotta go, I’ve got another date.",
        "No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought—it wasn’t that funny. So I’m still torn.",
        "Y’know, you’re right. Thank you.",
        "(waking up) What? (notices that there is now a beautiful woman sitting next to him)",
        "What?",
        "(now fully awake) Are we really in Montreal?!",
        "Coffee sounds great. (They get up) Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?",
        "What?",
        "Uh, actually Joey, it's the Cretaceous period.",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Pheebs, you're talking about putting your body through an awful lot. I mean, morning sickness, uh, labour. And it's all for somebody else.",
        "The stuff I just mentioned.",
        "Yeah, that is nice......lying!! No way is that the reason.",
        "And you're afraid you won't be able to *fill his shoes*. [grins]",
        "[stops grinning] Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.",
        "Just go for it Chandler.",
        "[waves back and takes something (a piece of chalk?) from his hand and pretends to make it disappear in his ear. He then makes it appear from his mouth.]",
        "[puts his tray on the table with the other scientists. He looks at the scientists and then at Joey.] That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later.",
        "[enters] Hey. (to Joey) Listen, I'm really really sorry about what happened today in the cafeteria.",
        "It's not just me. The scientists and the tour guides *never* sit together.",
        "It's like that everywhere Joey. Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work, the waiters eat with the other waiters and the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?",
        "Thank you Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table [puts tray down on middle table] in the middle. I'm having my lunch right here with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.",
        "You know, we work in the Museum of Natural History, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and you know what I see? I see division. Division between people with white coats and people in blue blazers. And I ask, myself, my God, WHY? Now I say, we shed these coats that separate us and get to know the people underneath. [He whips off his lab coat and throws it on the floor.] I'm Ross. I'm divorced, and I have a kid.",
        "All right, there you go.",
        "Okay, okay, good for you.",
        "[stammering] oh, uh, er, Wow, Rhonda.",
        "Ah, okay Scott!",
        "People can hear you.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That is one good looking man!",
        "Dude!",
        "Here’s your girlfriend’s button. (Holding the button.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates s*x with a real good lookin’ guy.",
        "Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.",
        "Yeah.",
        "They’re not a couple!",
        "Oh yeah!",
        "No.",
        "Y’know what, I don’t know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the s*x is between some guy and your girlfriend.",
        "Oh no-no-no, I’m there.",
        "Oh yeah!",
        "Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.",
        "All right, let’s not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.",
        "Here she comes. Don’t say a word, okay? Just be cool, don’t be…y'know you.",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, absolutely! (Chandler mumbles something.)",
        "Okay, I… (Walks away.)",
        "Uh, hello!",
        "Oh, yumm!",
        "Cookies and p0rn, you’re the best mom ever!!",
        "Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?",
        "Oh, whatever. (Laughs and gives Joey the thumbs up heading back to his apartment. Joey follows him)",
        "So you were right?",
        "Chandler!",
        "He’s right, what she did was unforgivable.",
        "How might you be wrong?",
        "That’s all you’re basing this on?",
        "So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?",
        "Oh my God!",
        "This is beautiful!",
        "Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?",
        "Hey!",
        "What are you saying?",
        "Well, if-if she thought they were on a break…",
        "Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?",
        "Now, how will they know if you’re ready?",
        "(He does so, and finds a half-eaten box of cookies.) You’re good. (Tries a cookie.) These are not.",
        "Five.",
        "Challenge extended.",
        "Challenge excepted.",
        "We’ll be starting with apples.",
        "Yes. Yes. Yes. (They’re perfect so far.)",
        "They have another guess.",
        "How did you know she would buy scotch tape?",
        "Oh sure, \"Ross will do it!\" It’s not like he has a job, or a child, or a life of his own.",
        "No-no-no, I-I wanna play.",
        "The test is ready.",
        "Okay, each team will answer ten questions. The first team that answers the most questions wins. Okay, the categories are, Fears and Pet Peeves, Ancient History, Literature, and It’s All Relative. Now, the coin toss to see who goes first. (He flips the coin and they all watch it hit the table and stop. Then they all look up at him, to see who goes first.) Okay, somebody call it this time.",
        "It’s heads. (The guys celebrate.) Gentlemen, pick your category.",
        "What is Monica’s biggest pet peeve?",
        "That’s correct. Ladies?",
        "According to Chandler, what phenomenon scares the bejeezus out of him?",
        "That is correct.",
        "Gentlemen, you’re pick.",
        "Monica and I have a grandmother who died, you both went to her funeral, name that grandmother!",
        "Althea is correct.",
        "Every week, the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joey’s apartment. What name appears on the address label?",
        "I’m afraid the TV Guide comes to Chinandolor Bong.",
        "All right, the score is nine to eight in favor of the guys. Ladies if you miss this the game is theirs, pick your category.",
        "You don’t have to shout everything.",
        "Ooh. What is the name of Chandler’s father’s Las Vegas all-male burlesque?",
        "All right, we have a tie. Luckily, I have prepared for such an event. (He opens up an envelope and holds up some note cards.) The Lightning Round!",
        "Thirty seconds, all the questions you can answer.",
        "150 dollars.",
        "200 dollars.",
        "Excuse me.",
        "All right, gentlemen, you’re up first.",
        "You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round begins—stop it (Chandler stops jumping)—now. What was Monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?",
        "Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie…",
        "Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...",
        "Correct. In what part of her body did Monica get a pencil stuck at age 14?",
        "Eww! No!! Her ear! All right, Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?",
        "Two seconds…",
        "11, unbelievable 11 is correct. (The guys celebrate.) All right, that’s 4 for the guys. Ladies, you’re up.",
        "30 seconds on the clock. 5 questions wins the game. The lightning round begins…now! What is Joey’s favorite food?",
        "Correct. Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl’s breast?",
        "No, 19.",
        "Joey, had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?",
        "Correct, his profession was?",
        "Correct! What is Chandler Bing’s job?",
        "10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.",
        "Don’t blame the questions!",
        "(pretend fishing in the living room) Ohh, Geller’s got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! (Swinging the rod back and forth) It’s the classic struggle between man and—(swings the rod and knocks over a lamp.) Someone knocked over a lamp.",
        "Because there are naked ladies there.",
        "There are naked ladies there too.",
        "Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take ‘em off and we’ll have some fun.",
        "Hi!",
        "Catch any big fish? (Phoebe, Ross, and Monica all go over to him.)",
        "Are you kidding?!",
        "He hasn’t gotten out of that chair in two days.",
        "Hey!",
        "Hi!",
        "No.",
        "You want me to take some girl I’ve never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.",
        "All right, I’ll do it.",
        "Please hurry.",
        "When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who wouldn’t be miserable? I’m telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.",
        "I’ve gotta go, there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard! (He hangs up and runs out.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Emily is…incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it, I mean the whole weekend was like a dream. (Sees Rachel coming back from the bathroom.) Oh! And you! Rach!",
        "Hey! You were so right!",
        "Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be happy for each other.",
        "I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn’t quite there. Y’know, I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy…",
        "Joshua…guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought of it kinda…y’know.",
        "But now! I’m there! I’m totally there! I’m-I’m finally where you are!",
        "Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily.",
        "Happy for you. (He punches her back.)",
        "No, it’s really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.",
        "Help! Help!! Help! Help!!",
        "Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? (Imitating himself) Help! Help!",
        "Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something—or should I call it (In an English accent) football?",
        "What’s ah, what’s so funny about that?",
        "Well, we didn’t have freedom here until 1776, either so…",
        "Cheers!",
        "Oh, just hold on a second. I’m watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don’t know what the big deal is. I’m man enough to play this sport.",
        "(shocked) Hey!",
        "Hey, I can handle it! All right?",
        "That’s ‘cause-‘cause you’re mom’s dog kept-kept looking at me.",
        "And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?",
        "Well, you should’ve seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he’s like Joe Rugby.",
        "Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I’m gonna show her how tough I really am!",
        "Look, don’t worry about me. Okay? I’ll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I’ll uh, I’ll be that guy right out of the circle. (He points to a player who starts running and then gets viscously tackled from behind.)",
        "They don’t look any bigger than me!",
        "All right.",
        "Okay, I know what I have to do. I’ve got to go Red Ross. (Joey and Phoebe don’t know what he’s talking about.) Y’know, Red Ross!",
        "Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!",
        "You’ll see.",
        "JOEY!!!!!!",
        "Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!",
        "(to Emily) Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water?",
        "Thanks. (When she’s gone he collapses into Joey.) I-I think I’m dying. I really do.",
        "(to Phoebe) Tell my son that I love him. (Emily returns with the water.) Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!",
        "(whines \"No.\") That’s not true!",
        "What? No! No, I’m not stopping. I’m Red Ross!",
        "I don’t care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!",
        "No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.",
        "I like that.",
        "Huh?",
        "All right, bad ankle, got it!",
        "Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!",
        "But-but, Liam’s on my team.",
        "I’m gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in! (Squeals like a madman.)",
        "Oh no! That-that’ll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y’know what? I’m buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it’s in my pocket.",
        "No, not you. (Emily gets it.)",
        "Oh, I kinda was, wasn’t I?",
        "I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven’t done that since I was four and I washed my dad’s Porsche with rocks.",
        "Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose—I mean I-I’m not proud of it but, I really am. And it’s all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.",
        "No, no, I’m serious. Thank you.",
        "It’s worth the pain. (She goes to hug him again.) Y’know what, you know what? It’s not.",
        "Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Bye. (They kiss.)",
        "Oh yeah, she’s-she’s amazing. And-and she’s so much fun. And! Y’know what? When I’m with her, I’m fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes. (Chandler is shocked.) She’s leaving in two days, I don’t have to do it.",
        "Yeah, she’s got to go back to London. But you know what? I’ve been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that’s it. Y’know.",
        "Pheebs!",
        "(starts rubbing her belly) Hello! Hello!",
        "Well, as much as I’d like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren’t going to be here. All right? I mean, she’s going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I’ve got a whole special evening planned. So I’m sorry, no party.",
        "You really didn’t know?",
        "(interrupting Monica and Emily) So we should probably get going soon.",
        "Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y’know, then The Plaza for dinner.",
        "No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It’s usually, \"Surprise!\" And then, \"Oh my God, I’m so surprised—good-bye!\"",
        "Monica said that did she? (He squeezes Monica’s knee really hardly and Monica winces in pain.)",
        "Yes, we have something we have to get to.",
        "What big thing?",
        "(stopping them) Okay, that-that’s enough! Y’know, let’s, let’s let someone else play.",
        "Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.",
        "That’s okay. She’s still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it’s too late to do any of the things I had planned, so…",
        "Yeah.",
        "Helps a little.",
        "Yeah, have a seat.",
        "That’s okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn’t want it to end this way, y’know?",
        "What do you mean?",
        "Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment.",
        "You think?",
        "Hey, you’re right.",
        "Thanks. (He starts to go inside and stops.) What photo album was it?",
        "Oh my God! Those weren’t albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach! (He hurries inside and Chandler is taking out the garbage.)",
        "Hi.",
        "So uh, Emily just went to the airport.",
        "Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y’know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so…",
        "(Thinks about it.) Nah.",
        "Well I, that’s the thing, I don’t know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said, (In a British accent.) \"This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let’s just enjoy…\"",
        "And why do you care so much?",
        "You had fantasies about Emily?",
        "Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?",
        "Ahh.",
        "We said it was only going to be two weeks, y’know?",
        "What-what is love really?",
        "I am a good kisser.",
        "Emily! (Runs up.)",
        "I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off.",
        "That’s, that’s, that’s a big candy bar. (She’s holding one of those huge Toblerone bars.) I had the most amazing time with you.",
        "(stops her) Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm, I’ve been thinking, I’m just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.",
        "That’s no problem.",
        "I did.",
        "Thank you.",
        "She said, \"Thank you.\" I said, \"I love you.\" And she said, \"Thank you.\"",
        "What do I do now?",
        "She already lives in London.",
        "Okay! Okay! But if she doesn’t call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y’know just to she what’s going on, and, and she says she’ll call me back, but then she doesn’t. Then it’s over.",
        "(Answers the phone.) Hello?",
        "Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?",
        "No, no, that-that, that’s all right. Umm, I’m just glad you called.",
        "Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?",
        "She doesn’t know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.",
        "Well…",
        "I’m not proving anything. Okay, I’m done listening to you. If I hadn’t let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would’ve put my fist through the wall!",
        "No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!",
        "What?",
        "I made fun of his accent.",
        "No.",
        "Really?",
        "All right. All right, I’m gonna do it!",
        "I’m gonna, I’m gonna go to London and I’m going to fight for her.",
        "(on phone) Hey.",
        "No, because she hasn’t come home yet. And she hasn’t been home all night! She’s obviously staying with that other guy, and I’m the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!",
        "About four hours.",
        "(yelling, thinking Emily can hear him through the answering machine all the way to New York.) I love you too! I’m, I’m gonna call you right now from the phone booth! (Realises) You can’t hear me. (Goes to make his call.)",
        "Hi.",
        "Ohh! Thank you.",
        "Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.",
        "Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock’s a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?",
        "Hey, uh, you can ignore that.",
        "Uhh, believe me when he’s older, he’ll understand.",
        "I’ll be right there. (He goes over and opens the door to Carol, Susan, and Ben.) (To Ben.) Hello! (To Carol.) Hello! (To Susan.) Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan.",
        "Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so…",
        "Oh come on! That’s-that’s… true.",
        "Hey!",
        "So uh, Emily called last night…",
        "Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they’re going to the theatre together! They’re going to dinner! They’re going horseback riding!",
        "Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was: \"My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great.\"",
        "Hey, they’re going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y’know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful—didn’t you see Personal Best?",
        "How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!",
        "What a weird way to kick me when I’m down.",
        "Oh. What’s wrong with Ross?",
        "Actually that-that’s not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found… (Sees everyone staring at him and stops.) Y’know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend’s a lesbian. (Leaves.)",
        "(opening the door.) Hey!",
        "Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, \"No.\" I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, \"No.\" I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, \"No.\" So, he’s sweeping. (We see Ben playing with a broom and a dustpan.)",
        "So umm, any word from Susan?",
        "Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don’t know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?",
        "Y’know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.",
        "Am I?!",
        "Am I?!",
        "Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y’know? Say-say they’re coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they’re laughing, y’know, someone innocently touches someone else… There’s electricity, it’s new. It’s exciting. Are you telling me there isn’t even the slightest possibility of something happening?",
        "OH MY GOD!! I didn’t really believe it until you just said it!!",
        "(returning from the phone.) So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!",
        "So! Poetry? Susan’s gay! They’re being gay together!",
        "Oh, wake up!",
        "Excuse me?",
        "Look, I don’t know what you’re talking about, I am not a crazy, jealous person.",
        "What?",
        "It does not!",
        "This is not fun!",
        "Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.",
        "Nice luggage.",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh, I missed you too.",
        "(To Carol) No tongue. (And gives her the thumbs up.)",
        "(entering) Hey guys!",
        "Oh no, not yet.",
        "Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?",
        "Yeah—oh! Hey listen umm, Emily found this wedding dress in London…",
        "Yeah, but it didn’t fit. Well, luckily there’s a store here that has one left in her size, but I’m the groom, I’m not supposed to see the dress…",
        "Thank you.",
        "What’s wah-pah?",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey, do uh, do you have a minute?",
        "So listen uh, I know you and I haven’t really had a chance to talk since uh, Emily and I decided to get married, and uh, I was just wondering how you were.",
        "I know if you were getting married I’d feel, kinda….. y’know.",
        "Yeah?",
        "All right, I just wanted to check.",
        "You’re great. And I-I know someday this will happen for you too. You just hang in there.",
        "Oh, no, I didn’t mean, uh…",
        "Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didn’t realise that had become anything, yet.",
        "Oh. Yeah?",
        "Wow, that’s-that’s-that’s incredible.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "I gotta get to work.",
        "Hey, y’know, y’know what would make me really happy?",
        "If like the four of us could all y’know, hang out together. Uh, in fact Emily’s coming into town this weekend, why don’t you say we all have dinner? Say, Sunday night?",
        "Yeah, all right, it’s a date. (He leaves)",
        "(coming back in) Did you say something?",
        "Hey man.",
        "So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?",
        "Great! Because Emily and I are getting married in a month!",
        "Yep!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it’s going to be torn down, so… I mean, I-I know it’s crazy, but everything up ‘til now has been so crazy, and I don’t know, this just feels right. Y’know?",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about, Ernie’s at 9 o’clock?",
        "Oh, see I-I don’t know if we’re gonna be hungry at three.",
        "What happened?",
        "Noo. Why?",
        "Oh, Rachel, I’m-I’m sorry.",
        "Come here.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You okay?",
        "Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe? (Shakes his head around, pretending like he’s jamming.)",
        "Uh, I don’t know, whatever.",
        "Oh, I know. Y’know what, I never would’ve gotten this if it weren’t for you. No really, when I’m with you I’m-I’m like this whole other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love that guy!",
        "Yeah?",
        "Then don’t. Stay here. Just don’t go so soon to London, just one more day.",
        "One more day, seriously/",
        "So, then you can stay as long as you want.",
        "Oh no. Don’t, don’t, don’t start packing. Come on! (She puts some clothes into her bag, and Ross throws them out.)",
        "Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on.",
        "No. No, I didn’t. I didn’t want to be that guy.",
        "(entering) Hey, guys! (They both notice his new little friend)",
        "Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.",
        "I like it, and Emily likes it, and that’s what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing?",
        "Ugh, she’s saying good-bye to her uncle.",
        "Yeah!! Yeah!",
        "I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it’s-it’s so great. But at the same time I’m thinking, \"Well, I’m gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off.\"",
        "Nothing! There’s nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she’d have to uh, move here. She should move here!",
        "I could ask her to live with me!",
        "I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!",
        "Look guys, when I’m with her it’s-it’s-it’s like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y’know?",
        "I don’t want to do that.",
        "Yeah, no, you’re right, I know, you’re right, I’m not, I’m not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys. (Gets up to leave.)",
        "Hey!",
        "(laughs) Move in with me.",
        "Don’t be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it’s too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.",
        "I know.",
        "Well, so, you-you’ll get a job here! I mean, I’m always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!",
        "No, I can’t. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can’t leave him. Isn’t—you don’t think there’s any way?",
        "What?",
        "No, no, don’t. Why don’t we?",
        "Get married.",
        "No! No! I’m not! It’s-it’s-it’s perfect! I mean it’s better than you just-just moving here, ‘cause it’s us together forever, and that’s-that’s what I want.",
        "Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who’s-who’s to say? Does that me we-we can’t do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn’t it?",
        "Is that—are you saying yes? Is that yes?",
        "Yes! We’re getting married?!",
        "Yes!",
        "Come here, come here. Uh, (He takes the earring out.) ow! Emily, will you marry me?",
        "Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!",
        "Come on! Come on. Come on.",
        "Hey!",
        "Uhh, okay, it’s uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.",
        "We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.",
        "(turning around.) Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys…",
        "Yeah. (They hug again.)",
        "Pheebs, did…you want a cookie?",
        "Hey guys!",
        "All right, here’s the ring. (Shows Chandler the wedding ring he plans on giving Emily)",
        "So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?",
        "I sort’ve already asked Chandler.",
        "Joey, I figured you’d understand. I mean, I-I’ve known him a lot longer.",
        "(to Chandler) Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?",
        "Hey, how can it not be me?!HeyHey!",
        "Fine, y’know what, that’s it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.",
        "Great. Great.",
        "Yeah. Tell ya what, let’s not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!",
        "Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.",
        "Yeah, see, I don’t think it’s gonna that difficult considering this one won’t be taking place in the basement of a Pizza Hut.",
        "Look, I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything so far sounds great Joey, just remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay? Just a couple of guys hanging out playing poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?",
        "Okay, see ya later.",
        "Hey listen man, about the stripper…",
        "Good call!",
        "Hey-hey, what are those?",
        "Wow! Yeah!",
        "Smooth man. Yeah, you got some chilie on your neck. (Chandler checks and runs into the bathroom.) Well, I just want to say, thanks everyone, this-this was great. And hey! See you guys Monday morning. (They museum geeks wave at him.) Thanks Joey.",
        "Oh, thanks! (Takes it and throws it back into the box and leaves.)",
        "(entering) Hey guys!",
        "I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y’know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so…",
        "Yeah, right!",
        "That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.",
        "Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.",
        "My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!",
        "(dialling the phone) All right-all right, fine! I-I’m gonna call the cops!",
        "Not on you! On the stripper!",
        "Okay, well, we’ll call the company that sent her!",
        "So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there’s nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!",
        "Diverse.",
        "Where’s my ring? My dead grandmother’s wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?",
        "We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!",
        "Joey! The vet said it’s a simple procedure.",
        "Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much! (He grabs the ring, kisses it, and then does a double-take realising where it’s been.)",
        "No, that’s all right.",
        "Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you guys.",
        "Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are my… I mean, I’m lucky to have just one good… (They all start getting emotional.)",
        "Total wuss!",
        "I Ross...",
        "Take thee, Rachel...(All his friends have looks of shock on their faces. He realizes what he said. Quickly he says.) Emily. (A slight chuckle.) Emily.",
        "I, Ross…",
        "Take thee, (Glares at the Minister) Emily. (Chuckles) Like there’d be anybody else. (Emily is glaring at him.)",
        "As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily. (Points at her.)",
        "Happy too.",
        "Yay!",
        "Okay.",
        "(laughs) That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn’t it?",
        "(exiting the bathroom) That-that-that’s all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I’ll be right out here. (She slams the door in his face, to the gang) She’s just fixing her makeup.",
        "And, I love you!! (He walks into the living room)",
        "That’s true, thanks dad. (To All) People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!! (He starts to dance but stops when no one else joins him.)",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh no! It could be better, but it’s gonna be okay, right?",
        "No! No! Of course it didn’t mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y’know, because-because it was you…",
        "But it absolutely didn’t. (Yelling towards the bathroom) It didn’t!! It didn’t!!",
        "(sarcastic) Oh! Oh-oh, the band’s ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says—I don’t care about the stupid band!!",
        "Look, I’m sorry.",
        "Oh, right!",
        "(Bangs on the bathroom door) Emily? Emily? I’m coming in. (He opens the door to reveal that the window is gone, along with Emily.)",
        "(entering) Emily?!",
        "No, I’ve looked everywhere!",
        "No! For all I know, she’s trying to find me but couldn’t because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I’m staying in one place. (He sits down on the bed.) Right here.",
        "Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?",
        "(disappointed) That’s cool.",
        "Thanks guys! (They both sit down on either side of him.) I really appreciate this, y’know, but you don’t have to rub my butt.",
        "Em-Emily? (Looking around for her.) Em-Emily? (He runs to the door.) Emily! (He opens the door to reveal the Walthams standing outside.)",
        "Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?",
        "Now, hold on! Hold on! (Stops him) Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I’m gonna be at that airport and I hope that she’ll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel’s name, but it didn’t mean anything, Okay? She’s-she’s just a friend and that’s all! (Rachel sits down, depressed.) That’s all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can’t imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you’ll tell her that.",
        "Rach! Rach!",
        "Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?",
        "Oh.",
        "Not yet.",
        "Pretty soon I guess.",
        "I just, I don’t understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y’know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she’d actually show up?",
        "Same difference.",
        "I get it! Well, that’s that.",
        "What?",
        "Oh, I don’t, I don’t, I don’t know…",
        "I could, yeah, I can do that.",
        "I can’t, I can’t even believe her! No, y’know what, I am, I am gonna go!",
        "I know, why not?",
        "Right?",
        "Y’know—thanks! (They hug)",
        "Yeah, well…nah.",
        "Why don’t you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?",
        "Yeah, yeah, it’ll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?",
        "No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.",
        "Okay!",
        "Cool!",
        "Come on! (They go to the jetway, Ross hands the tickets to the gate agent.) Here.",
        "Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!",
        "You tell them to wait!",
        "Emily.",
        "Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! (Emily starts to run out and Ross chases her.) No! No! Emily!",
        "Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he’s so cheap, he’d never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough? (Hands her some envelopes.)",
        "Yeah?",
        "Sure. Why not?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn’t invite her?",
        "Yeah sure.",
        "Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.",
        "I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!",
        "Hi. ",
        "You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.",
        "You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.",
        "Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?",
        "Okay... okay, maybe I will...",
        " See, I see.... big passion in your future.",
        "I do.",
        "Hey, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.",
        "OK. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um....",
        "Yes, yes, that's right...",
        "What? [the cat jumps on his shoulders] Ow!",
        "You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.",
        "Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? [Ross turns and bangs his head on an open dryer door.] I'm fine, I'm fine.",
        "You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.",
        "I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.",
        "The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.",
        "Fine.",
        "Good.",
        "No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I’m happy for ya, but I’m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don’t know what to do anymore.",
        "Is this about Mark?",
        "Okay, it’s not, it’s not.",
        "Oh I’m, I’m making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.",
        "Okay, okay, fine, you’re right. Let’s ah, let’s take a break, (goes to the door) let’s cool off, okay, let’s get some frozen yogart, or something.. (opens the door)",
        "Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? (He’s frantically throwing the cushions off of the couch looking for her other shoe) Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!! ",
        "Yeah!",
        "Oh, thank you. (She goes to kiss him, but he holds her coat up between their faces to stop her.) Hey, hey. (opens the door, sees Rachel, and hides Chloe behind the door) Rachel!!!!",
        "Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.",
        "Yes, you can, very much.",
        "(seeing the thumbs up) Ahhhh!! (Hugs Rachel tighter.)",
        "No!!",
        "No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.",
        "What?",
        "She was...",
        "She, she was different.",
        "Nobody likes change.",
        "What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.",
        "WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!",
        "Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment.",
        "You think?",
        "Hey, you’re right.",
        "But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.",
        "Oh, that is so sweet.(listens) No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three.(He doesn't hang up and motions for Rachel to be quiet.) Well you didn't hang up either.",
        " Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y-- (Rachel grabs the phone and hangs it up for him.)",
        "Rach, I got a message from you.",
        "You're over me?",
        "Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?",
        "When, when were you... under me?",
        "OK, I need to lie down.",
        "Really. It's always been you, Rach.",
        "I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.",
        "What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.",
        "Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn’t say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.",
        "Y'know, hey! You’re the one who ended it, remember?",
        "You still love me?",
        "What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?",
        "What?!",
        "(starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind it)",
        "You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.",
        "Y'know what?  I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off.",
        "OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.",
        "[walks down the stairs and grabs the flowers out of the vase on the endtable] OK dad.",
        "Yeah, well.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Hey! Are you ready yet?",
        "Oh! Got ‘em right here, (Pats his coat pocket) check!",
        "Yeah, cheerie-o!",
        "Well, we’re all here! I guess we should get going!",
        "Oh, I’ll-I’ll come hug you.",
        "Yeah. (He does so and Phoebe hugs him.)",
        "Thanks.",
        "(to Rachel) So, we’re off.",
        "Thanks! (They hug.) Ugh, I can’t believe you’re not gonna be there!",
        "So-so come! Why don’t you come?",
        "To London! Come to London. Please? It’ll mean so much to me.",
        "Why-why can’t you take a couple of days off?",
        "This is my wedding.",
        "Fine. You’ll-you’ll watch it on video when we get back.",
        "All right, let’s go! Bye, Pheebs!",
        "Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, (Gives her the time-out signal.) honey, okay?",
        "What?! No! No! That’s-that’s time-out!",
        "Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything’s gonna be great, okay? Come on. Come on.",
        "Um-hmm! Doesn’t that sound delicious at the last minute?",
        "Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily’s parents got married here.",
        "It’s all right! Everything’s gonna be all right.",
        "Uh-huh, I see that.",
        "What? What?",
        "Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we’ll be able to find a new place for the wedding.",
        "Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?",
        "She said what?",
        "Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister’s teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? (He puts his pants on backwards.) This isn’t right.",
        "I can’t ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that? (Holds out his pants)",
        "The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we’re getting married.",
        "No. I’m saying it’s now. (He starts putting on his pants, backwards again.)",
        "There’s no ‘or’ in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!",
        "(chasing her, trying to zip up his pants. His got them on right now.) No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please—(He catches something important in the zipper and howls like a little boy and falls to the floor.)",
        "Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.",
        "Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!",
        "Hey-hey, since you’re the ‘fix-it’ lady, here’s a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn’t want to have the wedding at all?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I don’t know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.",
        "Excuse me?",
        "I don’t know. A month?",
        "I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.",
        "Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?",
        "Come on. (They leave and Chandler sticks his head out.)",
        "Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y’know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles…",
        "But-but, if you don’t love this, we’ll do it in any other place at any other time. Really, it’s fine, whatever you want.",
        "And, I don’t know, if it starts to rain…",
        "(Ross hugs his mom and dad)Hi. Mom. Dad.",
        "what’s up, Dad?",
        "(Holding him back.)Dad, dad, please. Look I don’t want anything to upset Emily tonight. Alright, she's had a hard enough couple of days as it is. (Picks up the bill.) Now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay?",
        "Look, face it, my father is not going to pay for the build-in barbecue and believe me you can kiss you gazebo goodbye. Now I might be able to get you the new lawn.",
        "I go back there with lawn ornaments, he’s going to laugh in my face.",
        "Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding.",
        "(Screaming) I’m getting married today!! Whoo-hoo!!",
        "I’m getting married, to..day!!",
        "Ahh, whoo-hoo!!(He runs back out the door.",
        "(Using a slightly different inflection for each.) I do. I do. I do.",
        "(Very Nervous)Really?",
        "Dad!! (Emily comes running in.)",
        "Nothing, nothing. Everything's under control.",
        "(Stepping in between them.)Okay! Okay! That’s it!! Parents!! Parents!! Back away!! All right, this is our wedding day! From now on everyone gets along, and if I hear one more word. NO GRANDCHILDREN! (Pointing at his mother.) That’s right!!",
        "(Sighing.) It was...This disagreement over...(She sighs. Ross notices her in her wedding dress.) My god. You...you look beautiful.",
        "You know what, I think we’ve had all the bad luck we’re going to have. (He hugs her.)",
        "My God. Rachel! (He walks towards her, grasps her hands and kisses her on the cheek.) Your here. I can’t believe it. (She giggles.) What happen? Why are you here?",
        "I Ross...",
        "Take thee, Rachel...(All his friends have looks of shock on their faces. He realizes what he said. Quickly he says.) Emily. (A slight chuckle.) Emily.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Yeah! (They high-five.)",
        "Ohh…",
        "Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.",
        "Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?",
        "Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?",
        "Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'know--Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?",
        "No, not since I lost her at the airport.",
        "HEY, SHE'S FAST!! OKAY?!! (Chandler is so shocked at Ross's outburst that he drops his spoon and backs up) Oh! You-you think you can be beat me? Let's go! Outside!!",
        "Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.",
        "That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.",
        "So, what? That's it?",
        "Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best. (They hug.)",
        "(breaking the hug) Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! (Runs to the door.) Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.",
        "Hi.",
        "She's doing her laundry.",
        "It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!",
        "Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.",
        "I can't catch a break!",
        "What thing?",
        "Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. (Looks at the rose mulch.) My God, think of the massacre.",
        "Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!",
        "Wait! It was my plan.",
        "And, I came up with Atlantic City.",
        "The paper.",
        "Events from around the globe.",
        "Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized…",
        "Yeah.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "Wow. Umm… Huh… I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.",
        "What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.",
        "Why are you laughing?",
        "Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.",
        "Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where my wife is. (Laughs) \"Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?\" Don't know!",
        "Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is…",
        "That is what the thing is.",
        "No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.",
        "No thank you for… Thank you.",
        "Okay, let's go!",
        "Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now.",
        "It's all right.",
        "Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!",
        "Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.",
        "Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's gonna be okay.",
        "Yeah, he's head of the department.",
        "Hello.",
        "Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?",
        "To be fair, he doesn’t seem to be impersonating Fonzie…",
        "Again, it's not that he…",
        "Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.",
        "(entering) Hey! I just heard. What's up?",
        "Breathe! Breathe! Breathe throw the pain.",
        "I do too! I do too!",
        "Argh!",
        "Argh!",
        "You did it, man.",
        "I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!",
        "(on phone) I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!",
        "(on phone) Hello.",
        "Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily! (He picks up a lamp and hands it to Chandler, for no reason.) It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst! (to Emily) Hi!",
        "No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!",
        "Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.",
        "(to the gang, whispering) She's talking.",
        "(entering) Hi!",
        "Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.",
        "In London!",
        "She wants me to move to London.",
        "I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.",
        "It could happen.",
        "All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.",
        "Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?",
        "Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.",
        "All right, did you just say all right?",
        "Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!",
        "Yes, tell me.",
        "I know. I am, I am so sorry.",
        "Again, very sorry.",
        "Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.",
        "Oh that is so great! That's…",
        "So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.",
        "No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.",
        "I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? (They're all quiet.) I'm actually asking you!",
        "Thanks for the help, problem solved. (Wipes his hands.)",
        "(entering) Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate. (He holds up and starts shaking a…)",
        "Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. (There are none.) Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? (He turns it over and reads the answer) Ask again later. Later is not good enough. (He shakes it up again and reads the answer.) Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!",
        "For what?",
        "Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.",
        "It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.",
        "Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.",
        "No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help.",
        "Thanks.",
        "(answering the phone.) Hello. (Listens) Hi sweetie. (Listens.) Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it. (Rachel gives him a thumbs up.) So will you come to New York? (Rachel wants to know what she said, and he gives her a thumbs up and she goes over and hugs him. All the time not knowing what's going on.)",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.",
        "Damn!",
        "I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it.",
        "Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the \"I get to see my wife,\" part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this. (He takes a big swig of Pepto Bismol.)",
        "I have no idea. I mean… But-but I assure you I will figure it out.",
        "So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?",
        "Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily…",
        "What?!",
        "Le Poo's still alive?!",
        "Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?",
        "Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there's this one thing… Okay, (Rachel has her back turned to the camera, and Ross isn't looking at her.) here goes. I made a promise that-(they cut to the other camera and Ross notices something coming out of Rachel's nose)-Oh hey!",
        "You're nose is bleeding!",
        "Umm… (Rachel blows her nose.)",
        "Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.",
        "Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out.",
        "Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?",
        "And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants…",
        "…is for me not to see you anymore.",
        "It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.",
        "You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Rachel, this is your apartment.",
        "You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.",
        "Yes! Please!",
        "That's okay.",
        "That's not advice!",
        "I'm going to the bathroom. (Gets up and exits.)",
        "(entering) Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?",
        "Hi.",
        "I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.",
        "No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?",
        "Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?",
        "I can't believe this is happening.",
        "I am so sorry.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "How come? Everybody else does.",
        "Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.",
        "Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's—Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.",
        "Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.",
        "Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.",
        "After what I did? Can you blame her?",
        "(on the phone) No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. (Listens) No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye. (Hangs up.)",
        "Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!",
        "Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.",
        "Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!",
        "(on phone) I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye. (Hangs up.)",
        "No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.",
        "I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there. (Points.)",
        "I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.",
        "Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice…",
        "Why?",
        "What's going on?",
        "Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do! (He storms out.)",
        "Yep.",
        "Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.",
        "Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.",
        "Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?",
        "You do, huh?",
        "What are you talking about?",
        "Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh… It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.",
        "Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!",
        "Hey! (Listens.) Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner. (Listens.) Uh, yeah, sure uh hold on. (To the gang.) She wants to say hi. (To Emily) Hold on.",
        "Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here! (Rachel stops.)",
        "Yeah, yeah, she's here.",
        "(on phone) Hi.",
        "(going onto the patio) Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?",
        "Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll see you're the only person I want to be with.",
        "Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.",
        "So, can you trust me?",
        "Well, I guess that's it.",
        "My marriage is over.",
        "Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.",
        "I couldn't possibly eat another bite.",
        "Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.",
        "I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.",
        "Oh God, no.",
        "You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.",
        "In this life, Phoebe.",
        "Yeah that's the same.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!",
        "Oh, this is Monica.",
        "Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.",
        "So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since I've been away at college.",
        "Well, that's cool. So did… (She walks away from him and he shuts up.)",
        "Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.",
        "(in a high pitched voice) Monica!",
        "So I’m thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I’m gonna be out with her all night.",
        "All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.",
        "Hey!",
        "I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.",
        "Hey. (To his parents) Happy Thanksgiving!",
        "So uh, where's Monica?",
        "Dude!",
        "Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart. And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams!",
        "Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is! Severed toe, you just said it!",
        "(To Joey) Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that.",
        "Emily's cousin kicked me out!",
        "Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.",
        "Who needs a lease when it's family!",
        "You got it.",
        "Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad.",
        "What?",
        "(entering from the bathroom) Hey roomies!",
        "Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.",
        "Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. (He plays the greeting, and We Will Rock You starts to play and Ross's voice comes over it.) We will, we will, call you back!",
        "Pretty cool, huh?",
        "(glaring at him) Joey, please! (Motions to his computer.)",
        "(entering) Uh fellas, (Does the maneuver and gives them a double thumbs up, which Chandler returns as he closes the door.)",
        "I'll take sports.",
        "All right. Uhh, international.",
        "Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.",
        "(looks) Oh yeah! You're—hey, you're right! Here's an affordable place, (reading ad) two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!",
        "Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.",
        "Okay, let's go.",
        "Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.",
        "Oh my God! (Looking around, which doesn't take him long.)",
        "I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.",
        "(To Joey) So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?",
        "(To Chandler) How about you?",
        "All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.",
        "Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application.",
        "Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. So…",
        "Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space.",
        "Are you guys sure about this?",
        "All right.",
        "So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just (Does the 'quiet down' maneuver).",
        "(popping up behind Joey wearing an Indian headdress) Come on, it's fun!",
        "Well, they're not mine!",
        "Why are they here?",
        "(entering, depressed) Hi.",
        "Someone at work ate my sandwich!",
        "My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!",
        "Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!",
        "(quietly) That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.",
        "Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, \"Keep your mitts off my grub?\"",
        "(entering) Phoebe!",
        "Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.",
        "That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want. (Joey walks by with a cup of coffee.) Hey Tribbiani, give me that coffee! Now!",
        "Yeah, of course, Donald.",
        "What?!",
        "(Proudly) Yeah.",
        "Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich.",
        "Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here…",
        "What?",
        "You ate my sandwich?",
        "(getting upset) Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?",
        "Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?",
        "(getting angry) That said it was my sandwich?!",
        "(jumping to his feet in anger) What?",
        "You-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!",
        "(losing control, we hear him shout outside) MY SANDWICH?!!!",
        "MY SANDWICH!!!!!! (Ross's scream scares a flight of pigeons away.)",
        "(in a stupor) Hey Chandler. (Sees Monica.) Monica!",
        "I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.",
        "On account of my rage.",
        "He gave me a pill for it.",
        "Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.",
        "I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.",
        "(entering, with the rest of the gang) What's going on?",
        "(covering his eyes) Dude! That's my sister! (She shows the rest of the gang.)",
        "Yeah, what's going on?",
        "You slept with my sister?",
        "This is not good for my rage. (Takes another pill.)",
        "My God Monica!!",
        "Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!",
        "I...reorganized the fridge. See, bottom shelf: meats and dairy. (There’s nothing on the shelf.) Middle shelf: fruits and vegetables. (There’s one lone tomato.) And top shelf: expired products. (The shelf is jammed packed.)",
        "Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I’ve already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.",
        "Hey, I am not unemployed. I’m on sabbatical!",
        "So what, we just sit?",
        "I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?",
        "Or that.",
        "I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.",
        "Yeah!",
        "(grabbing a notepad and sitting down) All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.",
        "And it can't be Joey.",
        "Or Joseph.",
        "All right. (Reading.) A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. (Stops reading a flips the page to find the next one is blank.) That's it? (Joey shrugs.) Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! (Flipping through the rest of the pad.) And what is, and what is all this?! (Reading.) The official rulebook of Fireball.",
        "This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!",
        "(To Chandler) And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work. (To Joey) Now come on!",
        "No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done! (After Joey walks past, Ross throws the ball down in pain.) Ahh! (Chandler shows him the burn spots on his oven mitts.)",
        "So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?",
        "Sure.",
        "Oh-oh, yeah.",
        "Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.",
        "Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh fine.",
        "Joey's not going.",
        "Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.",
        "I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.",
        "I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!",
        "And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.",
        "If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.",
        "How about we settle this right now! (He rips up the tickets.) There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!",
        "No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!",
        "Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.",
        "Yay!",
        "I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?",
        "All right. (Takes another copy.)",
        "Hey man.",
        "About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.",
        "Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest… (Pauses and looks at Joey.) But we had our best friend's interest at heart.",
        "I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. (Stops reading.) All right Joey, we get it. (To Chandler) I'm sorry.",
        "(reading from the script.) I am sorry, Chandler.",
        "(disinterested) Hey-yeah. (He hurries up to the counter.) Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please? (To the gang.) Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!",
        "Oh, thanks Gunther. (He takes it, hands the plate it's on to Rachel, sets it down on the table, and proceeds to pound it into oblivion while saying.) STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!",
        "(entering from the bathroom) Hey Pheebs, what's going on?",
        "No! No! No!",
        "I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in… (The duck quacks.) Actually, thanks!",
        "Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.",
        "Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.",
        "That's okay, Joe.",
        "(licks the envelope and encounters a foreign substance on the glue.) Oh God!",
        "Just, y'know out.",
        "I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.",
        "Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!",
        "Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say…",
        "Okay, I didn't know you would say that.",
        "Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common! We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids.",
        "I am gonna see her again.",
        "(entering) Hey guys!",
        "Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice!",
        "Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours. (Joey has lost interest and is watching the race again.) It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.",
        "Thanks!",
        "Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right?",
        "Oh…",
        "This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then…",
        "Okay. Sometimes I feel…",
        "Huh?",
        "Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm too whiney? (Janice makes an agreeing sound.) So you're saying, I've become so whiney that I annoy you, Janice.",
        "OH…MY…GOD!!",
        "I am now.",
        "Dude, we got to talk.",
        "I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. (He laughs, his real laugh this time.) What you're-you're not mad?",
        "Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.",
        "Okay.",
        "All right.",
        "(walking up with Rachel and carrying coffee) Hey.",
        "Sorry.",
        "(glaring at Joey) This would be the place where you explain the hat.",
        "Hey Pheebs, how's it going?",
        "Is everything okay?",
        "Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died.",
        "Your make-up!",
        "What's the part, Anti-man?",
        "Hey, how are you holding up?",
        "What happened?",
        "Wh-what did he say?!",
        "Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger! (Getting worked up) I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, \"Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!\" (Calming down.) I kinda scared myself.",
        "Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.",
        "What kind of problem?",
        "Nooooo!",
        "(hopping) 73! 72! 71!",
        "What?",
        "Well, who's gonna kiss my sister.",
        "Awww, man! Really?",
        "That's a good point.",
        "Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the history.",
        "(To Phoebe) Happy New Year, Pheebs!",
        "Y'know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!",
        "Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.",
        "Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.",
        "In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.",
        "Ohh.",
        "Okay! (She leaves.) (To Chandler and Joey.) Hey!",
        "I just asked that girl out.",
        "Yes it is. See. (Shows them the piece of paper she gave him with her name and phone number on it.)",
        "That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.",
        "Hi, Pheebs!",
        "Oh-oh, guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth (Talking into Chandler's ear.) Hornswoggle.",
        "All right, see you later.",
        "(entering, with Ben) Hi!",
        "Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, \"Wow, (To Chandler) I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before.\"",
        "(after he's left) Okay, seriously, what do you think?",
        "What are you, what are you doing?",
        "What, to blind my child?",
        "(talking to himself) My God! These pants are burning up! (He's still wearing the leather pants.) (She snuggles closer.) Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now! What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! (Out loud.) Are you hot?",
        "Okay, it must just be me then.",
        "That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?",
        "Thanks. (Gets up and as he does so, the sound returns. Without another word he heads into her bathroom.)",
        "(in ecstasy) Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh……….",
        "'Kay!",
        "Oh my God!",
        "(calling from Elizabeth's bathroom) Joey, it's Ross! I need some help!",
        "Well, you can help me!",
        "Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom…",
        "No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I can't put them back on. I can't!",
        "Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder! (Grabs some of her shelf.)",
        "Yeah, okay, hold on! (He puts the phone down and proceeds to spread a large amount of powder on his legs and makes another attempt at pulling up his pants. It doesn't work, and without picking up the phone leans down to it.) (Almost in tears.) They're not coming on man.",
        "Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?",
        "Hold on.",
        "They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!",
        "What difference does that make?!",
        "Dude, what am I gonna…",
        "All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.",
        "I had a problem.",
        "This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!",
        "Look at me! (Chandler squeaks in an attempt not to make fun of him.)",
        "Oh, be-because of the leather pants.",
        "Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides. (Chandler starts rubbing his temple again.) I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. (He starts to head for Monica's bedroom.) I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy. (Pause.) I would make a good cowboy. (He struts into Monica's room.)",
        "Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.",
        "Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!",
        "It would be so cool to live across from you guys!",
        "Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!",
        "(laughing) Ohh. (Phoebe takes a couple of steps to the door and Ross quickly hurries out.)",
        "(entering) What's going on?",
        "What?! What?!",
        "Actually, it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebe starts jumping to divert his attention.)",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.",
        "No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to",
        "No.",
        "No.",
        "A basket of mini-muffins.",
        "The small one.",
        "Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.",
        "Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again! (Exits.)",
        "Noooo.",
        "Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!",
        "Huh?",
        "That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.",
        "Well, he had gravity boots.",
        "Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. (He opens the door and stops.) Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?",
        "Right. (Exits.)",
        "Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but—I'm sorry. I, I can't help but notice you're naked and (He claps his hands.) I applaud you. Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it.",
        "A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know, furnished.",
        "Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.",
        "Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to work. I—What? (He notices something through the window.) No! Wh… What are you doing?!! (Dr. Ledbetter is slowly backing away.) GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
        "Chandler!!! Chandler!!! (He opens the door to the apartment but is stopped by the chain; Chandler and Monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.) Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!",
        "What the hell are doing?!!",
        "(To Chandler) I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!",
        "(happily) My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. (He hugs them both.) (To Joey and Rachel) You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!",
        "What? What? What?! You guys knew? (Joey and Rachel backup against the door.) You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!",
        "(happily again) You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react? (He hugs them both.)",
        "Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids…",
        "You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?",
        "(opens it to reveal Phoebe) Hey!",
        "Aww.",
        "Huh.",
        "Ohh.",
        "Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again.",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.",
        "Howard?",
        "Oh that's nice.",
        "Oh. Uhh…",
        "No-no, it's not that, it's just… I-I just moved in.",
        "Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.",
        "No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.",
        "Yes but too me he's just, man.",
        "(To Phoebe) Ugh, can you believe that guy!",
        "…so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.",
        "It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!",
        "Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags. (Exits.)",
        "Oh, no!",
        "Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.",
        "Phoebe! (He grabs her arm to get her attention.)",
        "What are you doing?",
        "You chipped in?!",
        "Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!",
        "Yeah, but you're making me look bad!",
        "(trying to get her attention) Phoebe?",
        "(tapping her on the shoulder) Phoebe? Phoebe?",
        "Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?",
        "So uh, what did you tell them about me?",
        "Ohh. (He cuts himself a piece of cake.)",
        "What?!",
        "(trying a piece of cake) Ohh, this cake is really good!",
        "Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.",
        "Oh-no. No. No.",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah, but still, cheap shot!",
        "No, I will not!",
        "You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?",
        "This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole \"We were on a break thing?\" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me? (Laughs--whines as he sees that no one is laughing. They're just staring at him in shock.)",
        "Hi!",
        "(sets Ben down) Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.",
        "I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings…",
        "(from the bathroom) Okay!!",
        "All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.",
        "You're not his godfather.",
        "(Pause) Of course I am! (Joey is relieved) Okay, let's go godfather.",
        "Really? That's great!",
        "Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you, (Starts to whine like a baby and Joey just glares at him.)",
        "Joey, you look nothing like Ben.",
        "(entering, downtrodden) Hi.",
        "Not so good.",
        "(Pause) Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!",
        "Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?",
        "Yes!! I knew it!! (To the people who didn't make it.) Bye-bye! So long! Later!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yeah, it is.",
        "No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.",
        "Seriously that's a lot of cups.",
        "Hey!",
        "What's up?",
        "Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.",
        "Well, you just…",
        "What?!",
        "Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.",
        "What?!",
        "And why wouldn't he get it?",
        "Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?",
        "Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!",
        "You're kid's name is Raymond!",
        "(entering, angrily) Joey!",
        "(angrily) Ben! (Pause.) (Happily.) I mean, Ben! Ben!",
        "Hey!",
        "Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.",
        "No really, I-I am! I feel bad!",
        "Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.",
        "I think, sub-consciously…",
        "(pause) I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.",
        "No!",
        "There you go. Thank you!",
        "No.",
        "(To Rachel) Yeah, I still don't know. (To the salesman who is hovering nearby) I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says, \"Kids welcome here.\" But that also says, (In a sexy voice) \"Come here to me!\"",
        "No! No! No! The \"Come here to me\" is y'know for the ladies.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!",
        "Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! (He signs the form and hands it back to the salesman.) All right Rach, let's go! (He picks up one end of the couch.)",
        "Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it! Come on! Come on!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together. (He starts backing out of the store.)",
        "What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.",
        "Yeah! Rach?",
        "Then tell him quickly.",
        "Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!",
        "A loser you did it with (To the salesman) 298 times!",
        "Okay. (Throws off the last cushion.)",
        "Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.",
        "Okay, go left. Left! Left! (The bottom of the couch is hitting the railing.)",
        "Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head! You can do it! You can do it! (She gets it lifted up and they make the first turn.) Okay. You got it?",
        "Good-good-good.",
        "Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it?",
        "Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.",
        "Oh great! What, you brought Joey?",
        "Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!",
        "Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. (Showing them) Okay Rach, (points to the sketch) that's you. That's the couch. (Points again.)",
        "Oh, that's me.",
        "No! That's-that's my arm!",
        "Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead.",
        "Come on, Chandler.",
        "All right. (They start up the stairs. Ross is first.) Okay, here we go!",
        "All right, ready?",
        "Turn.",
        "Turn! Turn!",
        "Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! (They start up the stairs again. Chandler is between the couch and the wall now.) Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!",
        "Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore.",
        "All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.",
        "I can't believe that didn't work!",
        "I'd like to return this couch. I'm not satisfied with it.",
        "That's what I'm telling you.",
        "This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half!",
        "Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit.",
        "(thinks) I take it.",
        "Hey! What's up?",
        "Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?",
        "Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing. (He pretends he's surfing by the window.)",
        "Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place. (Joey just stares at him) I'm Ross.",
        "You got ink on your lip.",
        "(to the woman checking her mail next to him) Hey!",
        "(to the woman checking her mail) Who isn't?",
        "I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross.",
        "Nevermind! (Goes back to his mailbox.)",
        "I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm…",
        "Jen, I know this may sound a little…(makes some kind of crazy noise) But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or…",
        "Umm?",
        "I will give you a call.",
        "Okay!",
        "So uhh, you ready?",
        "Sure. (He opens the door to Joey. Needless to say, Joey's stunned.) Joey…",
        "(from his apartment) Man! They cannot get enough! (Makes like he's a robot and waves at the cutouts.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?",
        "Wow! How'd you get in there?",
        "What the hell was that?!",
        "The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?!",
        "It was totally flirting. \"Somebody got a haircut (Makes some whiney, nasally noises.)\"",
        "Yeah, right.",
        "(backing away) I'm good.",
        "And on your anniversary, for shame!",
        "Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!",
        "Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.",
        "Well…",
        "Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.",
        "And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little…",
        "This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.",
        "I'll get it! I will get that! (Runs over and opens the door.)",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like 8-year-old boys.",
        "(I can't make it out.) The uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I'm just saying I like it. The hair.",
        "You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.",
        "You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!",
        "This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!",
        "Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!",
        "Really?!",
        "And thank you, for that.",
        "What? (Mumbles) What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.",
        "All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! (To Chandler) And not the one on the menu!",
        "(smiling) Are you sure?",
        "(To Phoebe) Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?",
        "Do you like it?",
        "Okay, I'm working on my flirting.",
        "Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like (checks his watch) ten minutes left!",
        "(running to the door) Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! (to everyone) Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.",
        "You'll see. Okay. (Readies himself.) Oh, what's-what's her name?",
        "(He opens the door while faking a laugh.) Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating like this. (Monica turns her head in shame.)",
        "Okay, (gets the money) so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh, wood-burning ovens?",
        "Gas? Wow! Intense.",
        "(to Caitlin) Hey uh, y'know that smell gas has?",
        "They put that in.",
        "The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.",
        "A lot of other gas smells…",
        "Meth-methane smells…",
        "Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!",
        "(To All) Was I talking to her about gas?",
        "Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there. (Goes and sits on the couch dejectedly.)",
        "Yeah?",
        "What do you mean?",
        "And she just gave you this?",
        "Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors.",
        "Well that I can believe.",
        "(To Phoebe) And she's supposed to buy this?!",
        "Hm-mmm.",
        "(sits down at the table) Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow. (Joey panics.)",
        "(turning and looking) What? Where?",
        "What am I looking at?",
        "Me too!",
        "Yeah!!",
        "Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!",
        "(to Gary) That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.",
        "(to Gary) He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him!",
        "Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?",
        "It's the—Chandler!!",
        "So where are we going next?",
        "Yeah, no one talks like that!",
        "Hey, I'm more cop than you two!",
        "Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!",
        "Umm, jealous! (He drops the cherry and it turns on.)",
        "Yeah, no problem. (Tries to turn it off.)",
        "Sorry! Sorry! Oh, (He sticks it under his shirt) there! (It's just there flashing through his shirt) Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!",
        "What is it?",
        "What? What? What? What is it?",
        "Uh-huh. Thank Joey!",
        "(on the machine) Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye! (He hangs up.)",
        "Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car…",
        "Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!",
        "Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!",
        "And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.",
        "Wow! I could've died tonight.",
        "I do have a newfound respect for life.",
        "Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?",
        "Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh! (He goes over and hugs her.)",
        "The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!",
        "Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?",
        "And somebody took a shot at me!",
        "No, a car backfired, but (Rachel suddenly calms down) I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I…I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.",
        "(stares at her briefly) Okay, why are you here?",
        "You talked to her?",
        "Well, okay, what-what did she say?",
        "Wow!",
        "Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!",
        "Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.",
        "Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!",
        "You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?",
        "Huh.",
        "That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.",
        "Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.",
        "Hey, thanks Rach. (They hug.)",
        "Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.",
        "(on machine) \"Hey Ross, it's you!\" (Hits the stop button) Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.",
        "(looking at the coffee table where his money was) Hey umm, was-was Monica here?",
        "Yeah, I want my money back.",
        "Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?",
        "I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.",
        "I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.",
        "What's going on?",
        "Oh God, here we go!",
        "Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's she like freaks out. Watch! Watch! (He takes his finger and moves it towards his eye.)",
        "Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I? (Pokes his eye)",
        "All right, I gotta go. I'm taking Ben to the park.",
        "All right, bye!",
        "Later! (Exits.)",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?",
        "I don't know, umm…",
        "What's with her?",
        "Okay.",
        "Action.",
        "Dude, you are sick.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.",
        "All right!",
        "Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading? (Phoebe ignores him) Pheebs? (Turns away) Hello? (He sits down next to her and she moves over a bit.) Phoebe? (He moves closer and she keeps moving away.) Phoe-Phoebe! (They end up hanging over the arm rest.) Come on! (He grabs the magazine away from her.)",
        "Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something? 'Cause if are please, tell me what it is I did!",
        "Well, I don't know.",
        "Well, whatever it is I'm-I'm very, very sorry. Okay?",
        "Okay. So we're, we're good?",
        "All right. (Gets up.) I'll uh, I'll see you later, okay?",
        "ALL RIGHT!! Phoebe now come on! Will you please tell me what it is I did that mad you so mad at me!",
        "Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?",
        "Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?",
        "Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?",
        "Yeah? Sometimes it's… (Does the fist thing.)",
        "Okay, I'm the baby. (Points at his eye.)",
        "Hey!",
        "(entering) Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay, clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?",
        "What do you like better flora or fauna?",
        "Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?",
        "Why are you mad at me?",
        "When did I say you were boring?!",
        "Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!",
        "Hey Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?",
        "Well, hello, Mrs. Ross! (Throws some rice.)",
        "Why are we in bed together?",
        "(checks) Yeah.",
        "No! But we-we didn’t have…sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don’t remember much about last night, it was such a blur.",
        "And we didn’t have s*x.",
        "(getting up) Tell me about it. (He sits up on the edge of the bed and has \"Just Married\" written on his back.)",
        "Hey!",
        "What?",
        "Yeah!",
        "What?! Hello! We didn’t get married.",
        "We-we-we—I remember being in a chapel.",
        "I—They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!",
        "Laugh it up, but the joke’s on you. Because we don’t need to get divorced, okay? We we’re just gonna get an annulment.",
        "What?",
        "No-no, that’s-that’s not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?",
        "I’m not going to do that. (Rachel glares at him.)",
        "Yes, exactly!",
        "Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I’d have to talk you into this more.",
        "I’m-I’m not kidding. Look I-I, I can’t have three failed marriages. I can’t. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!",
        "Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It’s right next to it!",
        "I’m asking you to do me a favor.",
        "And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.",
        "Hey!",
        "Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married. (Rachel shakes her head.) We register, and you get to keep all the presents!",
        "I don’t know if it’s true.",
        "Oh, okay, y’know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...",
        "All right. All right, I’ll do it.",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, yeah, no problems. It’s all taken care of.",
        "Oh yeah, why not?",
        "Okay. (Sits down next to Phoebe.) You uh, you wanna hear something weird?",
        "I didn’t get the annulment.",
        "We’re still married! Don’t tell Rachel. See you later. (He gets up leaving Phoebe in shock.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.",
        "What'd you say?",
        "Is that supposed to be an insult?",
        "So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.",
        "Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines. (Picks up the phone and does so)",
        "(in his head) Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this. (Looks back at his book.) Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes—Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?",
        "Hey.",
        "May I come in?",
        "Do you want me too?",
        "So do I. (Slowly walks in.) Okay Rach, before anything happens (He takes off his coat) I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. (Turns back to face her.) This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of \"Us.\" (Rachel's confused) Okay? I just want this to be (Kicks off his left shoe) about what it is! (Kicks off the other one.)",
        "The physical act of love. (Hisses at her.)",
        "Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?",
        "You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.",
        "No! No! (Grabs his coat) No! (Grabs a shoe.) No-no-no-no. (Grabs the other one and heads for the door.)",
        "Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?",
        "Thank you.",
        "All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack. (Starts to leave)",
        "(sarcastic) Yep! That's hilarious!",
        "Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.",
        "Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.",
        "What?! You totally get embarrassed!",
        "Is that so?",
        "(loudly so that everyone can hear) Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have s*x with you in the bathroom! (Rachel sinks lower on her chair trying to hide.)",
        "(to the guy in the window seat next to him) Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student? (He points at Rachel.)",
        "What the? What…",
        "Ohh, it was the best!",
        "I think the check in is that way. (Points)",
        "Phoebe! (They hug.)",
        "Hey, you wet my pants!",
        "Rach! Wait! The men's room is that way. (Points in the other direction. Rachel hits him with her purse and heads for the ladies room.)",
        "What?",
        "Oooohhh, I'll bet she's one of those people.",
        "What? No-no, a lurker.",
        "Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits for you to give up and then…",
        "No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.",
        "Uh-hmm.",
        "My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dance—karate lessons.",
        "Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport. (Does a karate chop, then does a little dance-type sway.)",
        "What?!",
        "Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?",
        "Joey!!",
        "(To Joey) Thanks man.",
        "Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie.",
        "Your what?",
        "What?! That's not gonna make you any money!",
        "(on the phone) Yes, hello. I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face. (Listens) A beard and a moustache. (Listens and laughs) Thank you. (Rachel turns around and glares at him.) No, she didn't think so. (Listens) I know it's like (turns and sees Rachel staring at him and quickly changes the subject) anyway, umm well make-up didn't cover it and we've tried everything to get it off and nothing's worked. What-what do we do? (Listens) Yeah. (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Yeah. (Listens) Oh! Okay. (Listens) Okay, thank you! (Rachel gets excited at his tone.) (Hangs up the phone) Yeah, it's not coming off.",
        "Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So…(Rachel stares at him.) Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.",
        "Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.",
        "Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you. Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here! (Rachel turns around and glares at him.) There are tons…of…freaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one will notice, I swear!",
        "Okay, there was some staring and pointing.",
        "Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. (Rachel glares at him.) But who cares?! Because it's all on me! (Rachel reaches into the fridge and pulls out two handfuls of those mini booze bottles.) (Watching her.) That is, one big drink!",
        "(looking at the price list) Umm… Wow! That's-that's some pricey nut!",
        "Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh?",
        "(gets up) All right. Y'know what? We don’t have to go downstairs! We can bring Vegas up to us! (He grabs a deck of cards and pulls up a chair.) All right, come on, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go. (Deals the cards.) 13.",
        "(does so) Oohh, 23. (Rachel looks at him.) Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars! (Holds out a ten.)",
        "You're right! (Gives her the twenty she won.)",
        "(runs out of cards) We need more cards.",
        "That must be our alcohol and beers! (Gets up to answer it.)",
        "Ohh, it's Joey! I love Joey! (Hugs him.)",
        "I'll do it. Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man. (He starts to sit down on the bed. There's one problem though, he's about two feet to the left of it. Needless to say, he misses and falls on his butt.) (Looking up at Joey.) Whoa-oh-whoa! Are you, are you okay?",
        "Ohh, here's that Macadamia nut!",
        "(he puts it in his mouth) Nope! Something else. (Throws it back under the bed.)",
        "I wanna get out of the room! Y'know, I…I really miss downstairs.",
        "Well hello! I'm Ross!",
        "Excuse me sir, you've got a little something right here. (He points to the corner of his mouth and they both laugh.)",
        "(bowing) Hello!",
        "Well, hello, Mrs. Ross! (Throws some rice.)",
        "Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.",
        "(he catches the ball and pauses, staring at Joey in disbelief) Also an island.",
        "(looks at his watch) 2:17.",
        "Are you serious?!",
        "Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!",
        "No.",
        "You bought Shawn Cassidy!",
        "Yeah!",
        "What-what is it?!",
        "Why is it inside out?!",
        "How much did you pay for that?",
        "Yeah? How much?",
        "ON A CAT??!!!!",
        "Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}",
        "(To Joey) Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!",
        "What?",
        "I know! (Looks at the ball in his hands.) Don't switch hands, okay?",
        "…now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!",
        "How do you know? You don't have a watch.",
        "Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!",
        "2 hours, 27 minutes.",
        "Hey Rach!",
        "Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.",
        "(catching the ball) Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!",
        "It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?",
        "All right. (He gently tosses the ball to Chandler who catches it.)",
        "Baking it didn't help, huh?",
        "I'm starving!",
        "I'm still hungry!",
        "I am!",
        "Oh, thank God!",
        "I know. My arm is killing me.",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, yeah, no problems. It’s all taken care of.",
        "Oh yeah, why not?",
        "Okay. (Sits down next to Phoebe.) You uh, you wanna hear something weird?",
        "I didn’t get the annulment.",
        "We’re still married! Don’t tell Rachel. See you later. (He gets up leaving Phoebe in shock.)",
        "(To Rachel) Hey, do you have any gum?",
        "I know.",
        "Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer’s office all I could hear was, \"Three divorces. Three divorces!\" Look, I just don’t want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.",
        "Look, all I know is I-I can’t have another failed marriage!",
        "Well, okay so, I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don’t say anything to Rachel, please?",
        "Hey! Hi!",
        "What’s up?",
        "Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friend…shaking up. Oh, that’s great. That’s great. (Kisses and hugs her.)",
        "Bye.",
        "Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody’s stairs!",
        "(interrupting) No! No, I won’t! I’ll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.",
        "Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?",
        "What?! Why?",
        "And if you wait right here, I’ll go get Ross. (Phoebe grabs his arm and prevents him from escaping.)",
        "…once you know the stories, it’s not that bad. First marriage, wife’s hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn’t allow you to get married when you’re that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada’s fault.",
        "What?!",
        "This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?",
        "We were drunk! I would’ve married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!",
        "(to the panel) Look, I’m sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don’t want to be divorced three times.",
        "(getting up) Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I’ll go to my lawyer’s office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth—(leans down to Meg’s ear)—Nothing!!",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes, second in two years. Third overall.",
        "Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk…",
        "Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.",
        "This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.",
        "I think just the annulment for today.",
        "Easy.",
        "No problem.",
        "Ooh! There’s no way to do this without her? ‘Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.",
        "Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? (Russell glares at him.) I will think about the therapy.",
        "Oh no.",
        "I couldn’t.",
        "It’s not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I…",
        "I… I do, I do not love Rachel. I’m gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?",
        "I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?! (He goes into her apartment.)",
        "Ohh, what’s wrong?!",
        "Oh my—Come here! Come here! (He hugs her.) It’s okay. Everything’s gonna be okay.",
        "Of course.",
        "Look I was going to tell you!",
        "Okay, maybe it wasn’t my best decision. But I just couldn’t face another failed marriage.",
        "Rach, come on, if you think about it, it’s actually kinda funny. (He laughs, and he laughs alone.) Okay, maybe it’s best not to think about it.",
        "Phoebe, I told her you already knew.",
        "Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I’ll take care of everything.",
        "Okay Rach, but…",
        "Look I told you…",
        "Look, if you’d had two failed marriages, you’d understand!",
        "What about the time I said we were on a break?",
        "Fine, I’m mentally unstable.",
        "What?!",
        "Crack isn’t even an intravenous drug!",
        "Oh, come on!",
        "Okay, I’m sorry, this is insane! I-I-I’m not addicted to heroin, I’m not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I’ll consummate this marriage right here, right now!",
        "And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!",
        "(stands up) That’s great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!",
        "And what—(notices the stenographer is still typing)—What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don’t get the annulment. Don’t type that! What?! Stop typing! (He goes over to where the stenographer is typing and in the process pushes Rachel out of his way.) Hey! Stop typing! (He’s still typing.) Stop typing! Stop typing!!",
        "Yeah!",
        "My fault?! You threatened the judge!",
        "That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!",
        "The judge wouldn’t let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you? (Walks on.)",
        "I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I’ve already signed everything and I put little ‘X’s where you need to sign.",
        "Y’know, I-I—you’ve done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?",
        "Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!",
        "Yeah! Right!",
        "You’re right. That’s very different. So let’s, let’s just sign the papers. All right? (Sits down and Rachel keeps standing there.) What?",
        "Okay, can we just sign please?",
        "Congratulations. (Gets up to leave.)",
        "What?",
        "Excuse me?",
        "Yeah?",
        "So then if-if—I mean if you think about it, this is all (Pause.) your fault.",
        "I’ve got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.",
        "Did I, did I even treat?",
        "That may be the most depressing thing I’ve heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer’s office.",
        "Eh, no problem.",
        "Totally. (Exits.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.",
        "No.",
        "I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn’t tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend.",
        "It’s nothing, I just gave her a hug.",
        "It’s also a sign of friendship.",
        "(grabs back his cookie) It was a hug!",
        "S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?",
        "I was hugging her as a friend. It’s not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she’s got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh…coconutty. (Phoebe raises her eyebrows.) What?! Oh, that doesn’t mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!",
        "(grabbing back his coffee) If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?",
        "Okay, there’s this guy, Warren, from the museum and he’s going on a dig for like two years and he’s got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?",
        "Don’t thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. (Rachel just looks at him.) Here’s Warren’s number.",
        "Okay, you go grab it!",
        "I don’t know what you’re talking about.",
        "Look, I do not re-love her.",
        "Look, we’re just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?",
        "You can live with me.",
        "What?",
        "Uh-huh. (Phoebe grunts.)",
        "Well, I’m-I’m just glad I could, y’know, help you out.",
        "Hero, I uh, I don’t know—well, all right.",
        "Oh please! (He sits down.) (To Phoebe) You’re gonna say things now, aren’t ya?",
        "Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.",
        "What do you mean, they’re not moving in? They-they’re still moving in right?",
        "What?! Over a stupid room!",
        "Oh no, yeah no, that part’s great!",
        "What’s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!",
        "Well, apparently not, and I can’t just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!",
        "(stopping them) Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I’ve known you both a long time, and I’ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you’ve been since you’ve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?",
        "Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?",
        "And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don’t ya?",
        "(jumping up) Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York! (Storms out.)",
        "(entering) Hey Rach!",
        "You’re never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That’s great news right—I mean for them. Right?",
        "Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.",
        "Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?",
        "No!",
        "No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?",
        "Good! Me neither! So it’s not a problem. We’re just two friends who happen to be roommates.",
        "Really?! We are?",
        "Ohh! That would be great.",
        "(laughs as well, but for a different reason) Yeah, I didn’t think of that.",
        "So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it’s a really big step! And-and what’s the rush?!",
        "No, I-I-I’m serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y’know you break up!",
        "Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn’t about the room, this is about what the room…represents! And unfortunately, this room (Points to Rachel’s room) could destroy you!!",
        "Fine! It’s your life! (Starts to storm out mad about his failed attempt at the manipulation of his best friend and sister, but stops and tries one last time.) I just don’t want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together, (Monica and Chandler just stare at him.) but that’s what you want, there’s nothing I can do. (Opens the door and tries one more time.) DON’T DO IT!!!!! (Finally leaves.)",
        "(To Rachel) So umm, where are the other guys?",
        "Fighting?!",
        "Yeah. There’s no breaking them up, is there?",
        "Sure! Here. (Hands her his keys.)",
        "Yeah, I’m-I’m sure. (Deadpan) Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind. (She exits)",
        "I’ve been back and forth.",
        "Ehh, I don’t, I don’t think so. She’s already talked about y’know, dating other guys.",
        "Yeah, well, m-maybe you’re right.",
        "Is that what I want?",
        "Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!",
        "Hey!",
        "Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.",
        "I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!",
        "Oh, but-but I can’t do it.",
        "Because, because I’ve got Ben.",
        "Of course he is! What, do you think I’d just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?",
        "(to the guys) I gotta go make a fake Ben.",
        "Oh, I’m just over here with Ben. I thought we’d say hi.",
        "Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. (He holds the phone to the fake Ben he has created out of a pumpkin.) Oh, I guess he doesn’t feel like talking right now. He’s smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.",
        "(answering the phone) Hello? (Listens) Hey Mon, how’s the packing going? (Listens) Ben? He’s fine. Yeah, he’s right—Oh my God! (He looks over at the fake Ben and notices that the head has fallen off.) Get your head of your shirt there son! (He tries to push the pumpkin through the neck hole.) What? (Listens) Yeah, it’s a pumpkin. I’ll come pack.",
        "And now you want that money back.",
        "Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for? (As he picks up the fake Ben.)",
        "I’m sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.",
        "Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I’d be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.",
        "No.",
        "How weird is that? Y’know? You’re moving in with me and have the one thing I don’t have. It’s like uh, in a way you-you complete me (Phoebe glares at him) kitchen.",
        "(in an Australian accent) You complete me kitchen, matey!",
        "What?",
        "Oh…my…God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!",
        "Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you’re obsessed with her. It’s always, \"Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?\" \"Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel?\" \"When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?\" You want her!",
        "(answering it) Uh-oh, saved by the bell. (On phone) Hello?",
        "(on phone) No-no-no, that’s great! I’ll be there Monday. And thank you again! (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up) (To All) Umm, that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!",
        "Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it.",
        "I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it’s temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? \"Professor Geller.\"",
        "(entering) Hey everyone!",
        "Hey uh, well, today’s my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?",
        "(he starts reading directly from his cards word for word very quietly) \"There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct…\"",
        "(continuing) \"…subcategories. The first of these subcategories is…\"",
        "No! Why?",
        "Ohh! Okay! Okay. (Resumes reading word for word from the card) \"There are three (pauses and looks at Joey) primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. (Pauses and darts his eyes between Chandler and Rachel.) (Rachel starts laughing) Each of these theories (glances at Phoebe) can be further subcategorized (glances at Chandler) into…\"",
        "Open with a joke? It’s a university, not a comedy club!",
        "(gets up) Okay!",
        "Thank you!",
        "Please don’t say naked chicks.",
        "I-I-I don’t even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y’know what? I’m just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.",
        "(entering) Hello!",
        "It went great! And I didn’t need any jokes or naked chicks either!",
        "I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone’s all, \"Ross you have to be funny and sexy.\" Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I’m gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.",
        "That’s right!",
        "(to the class) Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when—(sees Monica and Rachel.) Oh bloody hell.",
        "Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.",
        "Will you-will you please?",
        "Oh.",
        "(in his British accent) I’m sorry, I’ve got plans with my sister.",
        "(in accent) Right, will you excuse us for one moment? (Takes Monica aside.) (In his normal voice.) What are you doing?",
        "Just please stop!",
        "(entering) Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?",
        "They’re not listening too me?",
        "Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?",
        "(in his head) All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out, phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory (pronounced the British way) the team would never have identified (British) the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis (British). Were there any questions at this point? (One student raises his hand.) Yes. (Points to him.)",
        "(British) Come again? What’s-what’s this nonsense? (Giggles.) (American.) All right, I’m-I’m not English. I’m from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I’m sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? (Everyone raises their hands) About paleontology. (They all put their hands down.) All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I’m-I’m hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression…",
        "(in the accent again) Well, hello Rachel!",
        "Well, is this Hillary your HOT assistant chef Hillary?",
        "The one that always stares at me when I come in?",
        "Still I could tell. She was into me. (Joey rolls his eyes.) Well, why don’t you set us up?",
        "Maybe it’s a universal thing?",
        "Hey guys.",
        "What’s up? (He smiles. His teeth are freakishly white.)",
        "I whitened them.",
        "Yeah. What do you think.",
        "Come on, seriously.",
        "Ahh, I-I did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to.",
        "A-A day.",
        "I know. That’s why I did it. (With a big smile) Come on, are they really that bad?",
        "Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh…",
        "I don’t know what I’m going to do. That date starts in like an hour.",
        "Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.",
        "Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We’re not 13 anymore.",
        "But, won’t she notice I have makeup on?",
        "What??",
        "No. I am not putting on makeup. (Knock at the door. Phoebe enters.)",
        "Mmm-Hmm.",
        "Mmm.",
        "Mm-Hmm.",
        "(Chuckling) Hmm-Hmm.",
        "Mmm-Unmm.",
        "Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. (Putting his hand up to block his mouth.) Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let’s talk more about you. Hmm.",
        "Mmm.",
        "(Giggling) Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. (Picking up a piece of bread and covering his mouth.) Me, neither. I’ve had a really good time too, you know. (Putting the bread down.)",
        "(Putting the bread up to his nose.) Ohh, I just like the smell. (Sniffing it.) Mmmm.",
        "Hmm-Hmm.",
        "Mmm-Hmm. (Picking up their wine glasses.)",
        "(Covering his mouth with the glass.) How about all the way.",
        "(Looking at the posters.) Wow, cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster? (They sit down on the couch. Ross smiles and the black light fluoresces his teeth.) So, ahh, where were we?",
        "Ohh, you can see them, huh?",
        "I-I, did that for you.",
        "What’s a matter with me? You’ve got a black light. It’s 1999!",
        "So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.",
        "Hi! (Rushes over to shake her hand instantly.)",
        "So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?",
        "Thank you for bringing her into our lives.",
        "Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.",
        "Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hey!",
        "(enters) Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what ‘cha doin?",
        "Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?",
        "Put it back exactly where you found it?",
        "‘Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.",
        "Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?",
        "Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.",
        "Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak…out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.",
        "Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. (Chandler fixes it and a picture frame off the table.) And that goes back up there.",
        "Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.",
        "Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.",
        "Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.",
        "Hey, I've been married 3 times",
        "Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.",
        "Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go \"ba dum bum chessh\"",
        "Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.",
        "Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.",
        "They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.",
        "(nonchalantly) I'm never gonna find love again.",
        "Who cares? I repel women.",
        "(whispers) What?!",
        "Why does anyone have to be naked?",
        "I-I had to show Chandler something?",
        "Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.",
        "Dude, what'd you have?",
        "(realizes something) The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.",
        "So really, what'd ya have?",
        "Bye! (Runs out)",
        "So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...",
        "That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing.",
        "Hey!",
        "You kissed her.",
        "Hey!",
        "You like it?",
        "It’s my new apothecary table!",
        "Well why not?! She’ll-she’ll love it! It’s the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.",
        "Why did you do that?",
        "She hates Pottery Barn?!!",
        "What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe—Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets! (Gets them.)",
        "Uh, yeah! I still can’t believe she hates Pottery Barn!",
        "Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y’know what I think? It’s just she-she’s weird. Y’know it’s because she’s a twin. Twins are weird.",
        "Huh. Y’know what’s not one of a kind? A twin!",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?",
        "Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new…(On Rachel’s glare)…old sheet?",
        "My apothecary table!!!",
        "I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!",
        "Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.",
        "Wow! I didn’t know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.",
        "A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!",
        "(glaring at Rachel) Fascinating.",
        "Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel? (She glares at him.)",
        "Really?! (To Rachel) Hey, y’know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here’s-here’s 60 bucks, why don’t you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.",
        "She does want to.",
        "Hey!",
        "Y’know what would cheer you up?",
        "I’m giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.",
        "Hey",
        "Wow, Monica’s letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?",
        "… and that’s the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life’s triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.",
        "I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she’s like OLD NEWS!",
        "Hi Janine!",
        "You’re gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!",
        "Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.",
        "Are you serious?",
        "Bye Janine!",
        "It was a dry day.",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Got it!",
        "Oh my God it’s just like I dreamed it!",
        "‘Scuse us",
        "Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?",
        "Right. No biggie. Stay loose.",
        "Why do they keep doing that?",
        "Right.",
        "Hey, what’d you guys do to get up on there?",
        "Yeah!",
        "We know!",
        "Okay.",
        "Monica! (Pause) Would it?",
        "Hey, I know what’ll get us up on a platform!",
        "The routine!",
        "Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he’ll wanna build us our own platform!",
        "We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it’s almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?",
        "So, do we really have to ask who’s going up on the platform next?",
        "Can you believe this? We’re gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment!",
        "No!",
        "Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y’know? (He mimics a robot)",
        "I don’t know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.",
        "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (Ross runs to be caught by Monica, but she moves out of the way)",
        "(only half-paying attention) Yes, of course they like you!",
        "(not paying attention) Yeah, they don’t like you.",
        "I dunno, maybe it’s because you’re really sarcastic. Or maybe it’s cause you uh-",
        "(trying to act manly in front of Janine) No I don’t want to play video games, Joey!",
        "For real?",
        "Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it’s my sister. But, uh, uh y’know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.",
        "Hey!",
        "And the place looks so nice!",
        "Happy Thanksgiving!",
        "See ya!",
        "Oh, oh, we did say we’d stop by this little thing Joey’s roommate is having.",
        "Some would say she’s attractive, yes.",
        "(to Joey) Dude, we were good!",
        "Oh, but-but it is, uh, it’s just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.",
        "Yeah, yeah, what is it?",
        "W-What was the one right before bananas?",
        "(faking dissapointment) Okay.",
        "Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!",
        "Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!",
        "Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd’s Pie!",
        "No, no, we will. We just won’t tell her she messed up.",
        "Yeah, it’ll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!",
        "(worried) Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.",
        "Okay, I think I might know why my parents don’t like you.",
        "Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.",
        "I don’t know, aheh, your’s was the first name that-that popped into my head, I’m I’m sorry. I-I didn’t think it would matter.",
        "How was I supposed to know we’d end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?",
        "I don’t know, I-I was all high.",
        "Okay, okay, I’ll tell ‘em it wasn’t Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?",
        "Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?",
        "Okay, fine!",
        "Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can’t? Okay.",
        "What?! What is with everybody? It’s Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!",
        "Okay, okay, we’ll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie! (Referring to the dancers.)",
        "Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?",
        "So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm?",
        "And um...You look nice today.",
        "What?",
        "(shocked) Eh?",
        "(cutting her off) You’re alone.",
        "(just trying to get out of the conversation) Ah well, can’t blame a guy for trying!",
        "Wha? No no! Ah! (Ross scarfs all of his trifle down in about a second. He looks like he’s going to throw up.) (Lying) All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.",
        "It tastes like feet!",
        "Are you kidding?",
        "Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.",
        "Wha-what?",
        "(in a 5 year old’s tone) (To Monica) You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?",
        "Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I’m sorry.",
        "Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn’t break the porch swing, Monica did!",
        "Monica and Chandler are living together!",
        "I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!",
        "Hey, you’re not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it!",
        "Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It’s not just about the pictures.",
        "(showing them the page) Here, check it out. It’s the first one, too.",
        "What?",
        "Uh, oh-oh, no you didn’t. I did.",
        "Hey, tell Dan, ‘Thanks.’",
        "What?",
        "Look, Chandler, it’s my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don’t print the name, so it doesn’t really matter who gets credit, right?",
        "No, it’s my joke, it’s mine. You can call them, they’ll tell you.",
        "It’s my joke.",
        "You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.",
        "What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey.",
        "Your joke? Well, I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.",
        "Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I’ll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.",
        "Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?",
        "Well, I’m not going to go now anyway (he goes to sit down).",
        "(showing the Playboy magazine to Gunther) Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.",
        "Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.",
        "Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?",
        "Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven’t gotten it.",
        "Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?",
        "It’s my joke.",
        "Y’know, I don’t think we’re going to settle this.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Hey Mon.",
        "Monica! (She appears, not sure why she was summoned.)",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, but I’m your brother. We’re family. That’s the most important thing in the world.",
        "We’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth—me.",
        "See, I would never snap at you like that.",
        "Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I’m a doctor, and I had a monkey. I’m Doctor Monkey!",
        "It’s your joke.",
        "No way.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Why? What?",
        "No, no, that’s funny. But maybe it’s time to move on, let it go, y’know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth’s father, so ah, he’s much older than she is. Looks like I’m not the only one interested in fossils, huh?",
        "Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings (Paul enters) in his ear.",
        "Oh, come on you guys; that’s funny! Y’know? Because he’s need—he’s got like a hearing aide y’know, ‘cause-‘cause y’know, ‘cause he’s all old, and…",
        "Really? That okay, that’s great.",
        "All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.",
        "But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don’t think there’s really anything you can do about it.",
        "Ohh! A man with a plan!",
        "This place is really beautiful!",
        "Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes—Do-do you want to make out?",
        "Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father.",
        "No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.",
        "Yeah.",
        "(loudly) Why?! Are there like bears or something?! (Looks around and then sees that Elizabeth is shaking her head no and realizes what Elizabeth meant.) Ohh. Oh, protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot.",
        "Oh no! Hey-hey, I’m the guy! I’ll get it.",
        "No.",
        "A little bit.",
        "Okay.",
        "Ohh, okay.",
        "What are you doing here?!",
        "Yeah, I recognize the ankles!",
        "(under the couch) You and your ice.",
        "(before entering) Did you really hear a bear?",
        "Elizabeth! (He opens one of the bed stands that he has curled himself up into.) Okay. Okay. (She helps him out.) I’m gonna go out this window. (Points to the window next to him.) I’ll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you’re going home, okay?",
        "(to Elizabeth) And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.",
        "Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain…",
        "All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy. (Paul just looks at him.)",
        "And I too am just a love machine. (Hums a little bit and mimics Paul’s flexing.)",
        "Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, \"I loved Dr. Geller’s class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!\"",
        "Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It’s a girl! Anyway, it wou—it wouldn’t matter. Okay? Because I’m a teacher and she’s a student.",
        "No, but it is frowned upon.",
        "Besides, there’s a big age difference.",
        "I know when I’m 90 she’ll be like 80 and it won’t seem like such a big difference.",
        "(startled) Yeah?",
        "Oh thank you. Thanks very much. (Leans up against the board and on a thumbtack.) Ow! (He pulls away.)",
        "That was you?",
        "Oh I, I don’t-I don’t think that would be the best idea.",
        "What time?",
        "Gotcha. (Starts to leave.)",
        "Oh! So-so seriously, what time?",
        "What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.",
        "Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone’s name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.",
        "Umm, no. No.",
        "Umm, it’s Cutie McPretty.",
        "Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I’m having a great time! Y’know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it’s not. I mean it’s not at all.",
        "(pushing Elizabeth into a doorway) Burt!",
        "We had such a great time! She’s-she’s incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn’t. It wasn’t at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. (Joey makes the international sign for big boobies.) (To Monica) A concept lost on some people!",
        "Well, not really. I mean technically it’s-it’s not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.",
        "Yeah. What-what should I do?",
        "Going out with who?",
        "Oh yeah! Wasn’t she uh… (Does the international sign for big boobies.)",
        "What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink?",
        "Oh, you have some studying to do?",
        "Y’know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to… (He sees some of his colleagues enter and puts his head on her lap.)",
        "Nothing, I’m-I’m just, I’m so comfortable with you!",
        "What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?",
        "What?! No! No! Wait! You’re right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There’s nothing wrong with that. Come on. (They get up and go over to the table where his colleagues are sitting.) Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.",
        "That’s right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we’re dating. And you may frown upon that, but we’re not gonna hide it anymore.",
        "What?",
        "Really? Its not just frowned upon?",
        "Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can’t date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can’t believe we have to stop seeing each other.",
        "I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can’t date. It’s against the rules. It’s forbidden.",
        "What?",
        "Really?",
        "Well I-I-I don’t care how hot it is it’s-it’s uh, it’s wrong.",
        "(feeling it too) No! No! It’s wrong! It’s-it’s-it’s naughty. It’s taboo.",
        "Let’s also get a hot plate!",
        "Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn’t free?",
        "Hey does anyone have any gum?",
        "Y’know what? I’m good! I’m good!",
        "Hey!",
        "When you put a ‘D’ at the end of ‘Fine’ you’re not fine.",
        "Hi Jill.",
        "Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.",
        "I don’t think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.",
        "Yeah, we went shopping!",
        "Sorry-sorry Jill.",
        "Huh? Oh, I got this—(Holds up this pink frilly thing)—this!",
        "Yeah! Oh, I-I love this babies!",
        "Ross, wants a pajmena?",
        "It’s a rug. (Jill winces.)",
        "Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one. (Holds it up for her.)",
        "Well. Hey…",
        "Oh yeah, how about you and the, (mimics her fake cry) \"I’m sorry!\"",
        "Oh stop.",
        "No, you stop!",
        "(entering) Rach? Hi!",
        "Did you tell your sister to ask me out?",
        "Oh wow! I mean, wow! I mean, I-I-I think she’s cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!",
        "Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, \"Why not?!\"",
        "I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we’ve been through, I just—y’know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.",
        "(entering) Hi Jill!",
        "Hi (sees Rachel and forgets her name for a moment).",
        "Rachel! Well, you-you’re not at home, you’re-you’re-you’re right here.",
        "Okay. So well I’ll umm, (To Rachel) I’ll have her home by midnight.",
        "I know what you mean, I’ve always wondered how different my life would be if-if I’d never gotten divorced.",
        "The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn’t realized she was a lesbian.",
        "I’d bet I’d still be doing my kara-tay. (That’s karate, he’s just saying it that way.) Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y’know, not doing anything else physical.",
        "No, I just think Monica was that fat.",
        "What?!",
        "Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we’d still hang out?",
        "(recognizing her) Oh my God! Rachel Green?",
        "No-no. It’s-it’s me, Ross!",
        "No, no-no, Ross Geller.",
        "Yeah. Right.",
        "Good-good, I’m-I’m married. (Shows her his ring.)",
        "Is-isn’t it the best?",
        "Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she’s right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.",
        "Yeah? Oh-oh, she’d be so excited!",
        "Come on! (They start to leave.)",
        "No, it’s okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don’t…",
        "(putting the magazine back and holding the money for it) Okay.",
        "Uh-huh. (Steps to a random kid nearby and hands him his money.) Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no p0rn for you. (To Rachel) Okay, let’s go see Monica!",
        "Hey Mon!",
        "Mon, look who I ran into! (Gestures towards Rachel.)",
        "And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler. (Points to him.)",
        "And that’s Phoebe over there! (Points to her.)",
        "(answering it) 1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon’s party. I played you one of my songs, y’know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.",
        "Sometimes, you should come over (Joey returns from the bathroom) sometime! I’ll play you one of my other…",
        "(To Rachel) Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!",
        "Come on Pheebs, it’s not that bad! Y’know most people would be excited if they didn’t have to work for a couple of weeks.",
        "Well umm, I’ve been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, last weekend…",
        "…will be two months…",
        "…since I stopped trying.",
        "What-what do you mean?",
        "Oh.",
        "Wow!",
        "Okay, I think I got it.",
        "So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.",
        "Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.",
        "Carol our s*x life is—it’s just not working…",
        "Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why don’t we get some shoes on ya, huh? Hey, why don’t you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! Yay!!",
        "Yay! (To Carol) Seriously, our s*x life… I was thinking, maybe I don’t know, we could try some-some new things. Y’know? For fun?",
        "Well I don’t know umm, (Pause) what if we were too tie each other up? (Carol’s shocked and obviously doesn’t like that idea.) Umm, some people eat stuff off one another. (Carol doesn’t like that idea either.) Nah! Umm, y’know we-we could try dirty talk? (Carol still says no.) Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.",
        "Come on. (Helps her into bed as her phone rings.) I got it.",
        "I got it!",
        "(on the phone) Hello? (Listens.) No she can’t come to the phone right now. (Listens.) Oh, right no problem. Okay, bye-bye. (Hangs up.)",
        "J-j-just relax, nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that you were getting better.",
        "(To Monica) Yeah, she’s fired.",
        "So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find…",
        "Oh. (He takes the notepad she was using and looks at it.) Wow! (Flips to another page.) Huh. (Flips another page.) Boy! (Flips another page.) Well, someone’s been doing their homework. (Flips two more pages.)",
        "Oh, I know. (Laughs) Y’know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda…",
        "Yeah? Well, I-I think Ben’s asleep.",
        "Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that. (Gets up and does a little kara-tay.)",
        "Hey, Pheebs!",
        "Hey, how’s it going?",
        "She doesn’t know she was fired yet, does she?",
        "Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.",
        "We’re really gonna do this, huh?",
        "Y’know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at… (A knock on the door interrupts him.)",
        "Okay.",
        "I’m-I’m Ross by the way.",
        "How hot is this?!",
        "Hey!",
        "Look at you! You’re up!",
        "Hey Joe did… Did you ever have a threesome?",
        "No! The reason I’m asking is that… I sorta had one last night.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yeah!",
        "It was, it was okay.",
        "Look, it’s just did, did you ever go to a party and think, \"Would really anyone miss me if I weren’t here?\"",
        "Oh-oh, absolutely!",
        "It’s just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around.",
        "Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.",
        "No, she kept kicking me away!",
        "No!",
        "Oh I a lot of stuff!",
        "A little. Yeah. I made a snack.",
        "Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard…",
        "It really was!",
        "Hey Rachel.",
        "Umm, no.",
        "That-that’s always good news. Are you okay?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Okay. (He does so.)",
        "We’re sorry.",
        "Didn’t you spend last night at Joey’s?",
        "Look I-I don’t know what’s going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.",
        "Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!",
        "Men. I guy I know.",
        "She is not… (Realizes) She’s gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can’t believe this.",
        "I’m sorry your husband cheated on you.",
        "Try telling my wife that.",
        "Hey everybody!",
        "Hey uh, this is Elizabeth.",
        "Oh no-no-no, we’re just two people who happen to run into each other here at the coffee house. (He winks at her.)",
        "Bye.",
        "Oh that is quite all right ma’am. (Elizabeth exits.)",
        "Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.",
        "Anyone else? Huh? Bring ‘em on!",
        "I don’t know Rachel, why?",
        "Well thanks!",
        "Well, actually it’s been great. She’s 20 so she’s not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.",
        "Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are…",
        "Hmm? (Turns around and sees that its Elizabeth) Oh, a student I don’t know.",
        "Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?",
        "Shh! (Laughs then composes himself) Of course, why don’t we go inside?",
        "Oh-ooh!",
        "Doorknob! Doorknob!",
        "Oh, okay. What-what about?",
        "Spring vacation.",
        "(quickly jumping away from Elizabeth) Yes, professor Feesen-sen-stenlger… I’ll be with you in one moment. (To Elizabeth) So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints. (And he ushers Elizabeth out of the office.)",
        "You don’t understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I’m not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?",
        "I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?",
        "What the hell are you doing?",
        "What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!",
        "Joey, I did not break this! Okay? (He opens the freezer and smells inside and recoils in disgust.) That has been broken for a while.",
        "Do not give him any money!",
        "Yes. Yes! Please, come in.",
        "Oo-oo!",
        "Yeah, it kinda grows on you. (They both laugh.) Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.",
        "Look, I… (He has trouble sitting in his chair.) Look, I’m having a great time with you and I just don’t want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So, I’m sorry I just don’t think we should go away together yet. It’s-it’s too soon.",
        "No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was…",
        "That! Let’s talk about that.",
        "Hey!",
        "Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn’t want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she’s going to Florida for spring vacation.",
        "What’s-what’s the difference?",
        "Hey, y’know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.",
        "I went to Egypt with my dad.",
        "Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, \"Spring break!\" (Imitates the party noise.) All right? I mean she’s taken my class!",
        "I’m gonna call her.",
        "Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl’s bodies, waking up next to people you don’t even know…",
        "Okay, she can’t go.",
        "Then what am I supposed to do?",
        "Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?",
        "I’m so glad you’re going on this trip!",
        "Sure. Sure. Look I don’t, I don’t know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.",
        "Are you into crafts at all?",
        "Well, yeah, of-of course I’m okay! What? I’m just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and (notices something) what-what is uh, what’s this? (He holds up a rather skimpy bathing suit.)",
        "To wear in front of people?",
        "Is this?!",
        "So uh, have a great time down there.",
        "Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?",
        "It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it’s revealing which I’m fine with, no I’m concerned about your health, sun exposure.",
        "Well, if what’s in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it’s-it’s get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it’s just milk.",
        "Really?",
        "Okay. Cool.",
        "Call me!",
        "Hey, remember when I had a monkey?",
        "Yeah, what, what was I thinking?",
        "What’s up with the greed Joe?",
        "Well isn’t there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can’t-can’t you pick up, I don’t know, an extra shift here?",
        "Oh, wait! Wait! Don’t you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you’ll get that job!",
        "Hi!",
        "Hey, what have you guys been up to?",
        "Wow!",
        "After one class? I don’t think so.",
        "Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that’s not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there’s a concept you should really be familiar with. It’s what the Japanese call (he holds two fingers up to his temple, and he does this every time he says this word) unagi.",
        "No, it’s a concept!",
        "All right, maybe it means that too…",
        "Y’know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don’t even care!",
        "Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!",
        "(moves closer) All I’m saying is, it’s one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don’t know, like a (turns and puts his face close to Rachel’s and screams) surprise!!",
        "All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn’t mean you have unagi. (Does the finger thing.)",
        "Y’know what… (Moves away as Chandler enters, panicked.)",
        "No.",
        "So what are you gonna do?",
        "DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!",
        "A lesson in the importance of unagi. (He starts doing the finger thing every time now.)",
        "Perhaps. Now I’m curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?",
        "I’m sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I—look, I just want you guys to be safe. (Monica comes out to throw out the garbage and Ross screams…) DANGER!!!!! (She completely ignores him and keeps walking.) Ahhh, huh? Unagi.",
        "(not turning around) Chandler. I sensed it was you.",
        "Unagi. I’m always aware.",
        "What’s up?",
        "Oh, why don’t you make her one of your little jokes.",
        "Y’know what? She’d-she’d love this. (Picks up a model of the Saturn V rocket, that’s the one that took man to the moon.) Uh, it’s an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.",
        "Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn’t actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely. (Apollo 8 was the first one that orbited the moon and the one that read the Christmas Story from the orbit of the moon on Christmas Eve, 1968. They also took the famous Earthrise picture of the Earth rising over the moon.)",
        "Why not?",
        "Oh.",
        "It’s not something you are! It’s something you have!",
        "Y’know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!",
        "It’s a great class.",
        "Yeah, yeah, I was watching. (The instructor just nods and walks away.) Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?",
        "No. No-no. No. What would you do next?",
        "Yes that’s right.",
        "I tired attacking two women, did not work.",
        "No, I mean it’s okay, I mean, they’re-they’re my friends. In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.",
        "Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn’t. That’s why I’m here. Maybe we could attack them together? (He glares at him.) That-that’s a no.",
        "Ah-ha, nowhere to run! (He starts to run towards them.)",
        "DANGER!!!!",
        "Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.",
        "How rude.",
        "Hi!",
        "Great to see you!",
        "How you doing?",
        "Okay! You take care!",
        "Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?",
        "Phoebe, why’d you do it?",
        "What?! Why?!",
        "I can’t think of anything.",
        "Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn’t invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?",
        "I guess it could.",
        "Well, if he’s angry, he really shouldn’t just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.",
        "Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?",
        "Remember? You-you were eating pizza.",
        "Okay. Well, apparently Chandler’s angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.",
        "Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y’know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.",
        "Oh. (Starts to get his money)",
        "All the time?",
        "Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?",
        "What?!",
        "I can’t believe it. (Pause) Can I tell you something? I’m a little mad at him now.",
        "Y’know what? He didn’t want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don’t talk to him at all!",
        "That’s right!",
        "Eh? We’ll show him!",
        "Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?",
        "So you two are really serious?!",
        "You-you’re gonna get married?! I mean… We’re gonna be brothers-in-law! (They hug.)",
        "Hey-hey Pheebs!",
        "Chandler’s gonna ask Monica to marry him!",
        "You told her before you told us?",
        " Excuse me?",
        "You're right, you're right, it is.",
        " So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?",
        "It’s your turn.",
        "Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn’t go well but it really did go well?",
        "Totally!",
        "Great!",
        "Wow!",
        "Oh, I love that guy! (Laughs.)",
        "(stops laughing) What am I doing?",
        "Look, don’t worry. Okay? You’re gonna be fine.",
        "Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.",
        " Oh my God!",
        "You ate my sandwich?",
        "(getting upset) Oh-oh really?",
        "(jumping to his feet in anger) What?",
        "You-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!",
        " (losing control, we hear him shout outside) MY SANDWICH?!!!",
        "MY SANDWICH!!!!!! (Ross's scream scares a flight of pigeons away.)",
        "What?",
        "What?",
        "Yes, yes it is. In prison!",
        "It took two people to break up this relationship!!",
        "I didn’t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn’t finish the whole letter!",
        "I fell asleep!",
        "It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! (they go into the living room, trapping Monica, Chandler, and Joey in the kitchen) (to Rachel) Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means ‘you are,’ Y-O-U-R means ‘your!’",
        "(starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind it)",
        "That’ll be a neat trick, when you’re, (looks at the script) when you’re dead!",
        "There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired.",
        "Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac…",
        "Oh my God. I mean…",
        "Totally.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "What are you guys doing later?",
        "(continuing) I just found out that Elizabeth’s dad wants to meet me.",
        "Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.",
        "Thanks!",
        "It-it’s great to meet you Paul.",
        "Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.",
        "Eh-wh—Excuse me?",
        "That’s funny. Umm…. (Pause, then serious) It’s not funny.",
        "Okay. I can, I can see that. Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind.",
        "What?",
        "This is—you—(Ross starts laughing.)",
        "Okay, umm I want you to know that I have never done anything like this before. I mean, I mean I’ve been in um, relationships in general, uh but I have never done it with a student—I mean I not—not it! I mean, I mean I don’t—We haven’t done it. Uh, I mean, I mean, we’ve-we’ve-we’ve done stuff. (Paul is not amused.) Okay, okay, a joke, a joke—lighten the mood. Umm, two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish.",
        "And the Irish guy wins the joke!",
        "Oh God, thank you! (Runs and gives all of them a group hug.) Umm, uh, Mr. Stevens I’d like you to meet my friends uh, this is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.",
        "Okay umm, why don’t we all take a seat, y’know? And uh, and I’ll get us all some uh some coffees—(He goes to pull out Elizabeth’s chair, but Paul steps in)—Yeah, why don’t you. (Paul pulls out her chair) Uh and you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y’know? Whatever pops into your head. (He turns his back to Paul and Elizabeth and points to himself for Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe. Then he goes to order the coffee.)",
        "(returning with the coffee) Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. (He sets down their cups.) So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.",
        "Joey?!",
        "Joey?! Joey!! (He runs into his bedroom.)",
        "Okay, I’ll just wait for him in here!",
        "(coming out of the bedroom) Oh! Oh my God! I didn’t even see you!",
        "What-what-what the—how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!",
        "(incredulous) In your mouth?!",
        "You were at the coffeehouse!",
        "He is my girlfriend’s father, okay? It’s-it’s, it’s weird!",
        "That was different!",
        "This is weird for me!",
        "How is that important?",
        "Yeah, take your time.",
        "(to Paul) Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn’t as bad as-as…",
        "Not all bad.",
        "Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.",
        "No! No! Not—I don’t mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son, who’s umm six and I still think of him as a baby.",
        "Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I’m sure you are with your wife! (Realizes) Oh, I’m sorry! (To Elizabeth) It’s unbelievable!",
        "You’re back.",
        "Y’know what? I-I-I… I-I have had enough of this! Y’know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you’ve got a problem with me, frankly…",
        "God no!",
        "Well if it doesn’t matter to her, it doesn’t matter to me! (to Paul) Still not yelling!",
        "That’s okay, I’m not so crazy about myself right now either.",
        "Uh yeah, I guess—Yeah! I guess so.",
        "Ohhh! Kids!",
        "That’s okay Rach, we’re not liking Ross right now.",
        "God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!",
        "Yeah, you didn’t get one.",
        "Hey!",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.",
        "I’m sorry, it’s just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp—to be a counselor!",
        "I don’t know.",
        "Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?",
        "Uh-uh—Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn’t really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I’m the one dating Elizabeth, not you!",
        "Yeah, yeah you have the ring?",
        "(to the rest of them) Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!",
        "What’s-what’s going on?",
        "Oh, you have to call the police! That’s what I did to the kids in my building!",
        "Oh! (Does a laugh/groan.) Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight. Umm, it’s supposed to be excellent. The director is the same…",
        "No! Okay! Okay! (Stops her.) Okay, look, can I, can I just-just talk to you for a second?",
        "Uh, so this play umm, what do you think? It’s-it’s gotten great reviews! Y’know the uh…",
        "(screaming) Everybody put their balloons down!!! (There is a temporary cease fire.) Now this is a nice suit!! (Shows everyone where he was hit.)",
        "Oh my God, you guys!! (He’s excited about what he thought happened.)",
        "Who?",
        "What? (Excited) A-ohh! (Realizes) Ohh. Oh that’s right that’s right. That’s Richard’s favorite place too.",
        "Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.",
        "Y’know, maybe she is too young for me. Y’know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don’t know what to do.",
        "Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I’m-I’m 12 years older than she is.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she’s-she’s sweet and pretty and…",
        "No! No! I…didn’t do that. It’s just… Okay, honestly no. I don’t, I don’t see a big future with her.",
        "I’ve got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.",
        "(in his head) Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn’t seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake?",
        "Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about…",
        "What?!",
        "Okay, break-up’s still on!",
        "What happened you guys?",
        "Rach!",
        "Hey, come on in.",
        "Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we’d be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn’t meant to be.",
        "I guess so.",
        "Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.",
        "Ohh, yeah I already have one.",
        "Phoebe.",
        "Ohh, I don’t think so.",
        "That’s impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!",
        "I was not!",
        "No! Pick me! I don’t want to end up an old maid!",
        "Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!",
        "All right.",
        "Hey, what’s going on?",
        "I found a note on my door, \"Come to Monica’s quick, bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar.\"",
        "What’s up?",
        "Oh my God. (Hugs Chandler.) Congratulations.",
        "Where is she?",
        "Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling, \"I’m gay! I’m gay!\" Can I bring her in?",
        "Hey!",
        "Wow! Happy Monica’s night!",
        "Thanks.",
        "Well sure. But I get married all the time so…",
        "You okay?",
        "You mean, we—you and me?",
        "Oh good, you scared me for a minute.",
        "I mean—no, it’s just ‘cause, it’s just ’cause you and I were like a nightmare. (Screams.) No, but there was some good times.",
        "Surely you can think of something good.",
        "What?",
        "Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?",
        "My hands?",
        "Yeah?",
        "(to his hands) Way to go guys. Y’know, you-you were really good at the stuff too.",
        "A what?",
        "One night, just-just s*x. No strings attached?",
        "No.",
        "Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I’m-I’m sure it would be amazing but I…gotta say I really-really don’t think it would be a good idea. Y’know? I really, really…don’t.",
        "Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw…",
        "It is! It is!",
        "Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!",
        "Yeah!",
        "It was just a kiss. (Phoebe enters and overhears this.)",
        "Look let’s not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn’t even matter!",
        "Oh no!",
        "And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. (To Monica) Which we are not!",
        "Guess who? (Enters fully.)",
        "Hey, I just realized we kinda left some stuff up in the air…",
        "Still thinking about it huh?",
        "(loosening his tie) Oh, who cares?",
        "(tightening his tie) And so do I.",
        "Okay. Sure. (Sits down on her bed.)",
        "(sitting up) No! (Exits.)",
        "(To Rachel) Hey, here’s a thought.",
        "Got me. (He shows of his hands.)",
        "Uh, Rachel, I’ve been thinking. I don’t think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I’m calling it off.",
        "Look uh, if we’re gonna do this…",
        "Oh, I see, so everybody wins.",
        "Oww!",
        "(deadpan) Well, I’m going to take off. (To Chandler) Congratulations man.",
        "(at the door) And uh, Rachel.",
        "What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person who’s going to enjoy these bad boys (holds up his hands) is me. (Quickly realizes what he said and exits disgustedly.)",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh, I’ll have some!",
        "Take it from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.",
        "Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven’t seen that since the forth grade!",
        "And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first! Now let’s take a look at… (Phoebe rushes in.)",
        "Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?",
        "Oh my God! Of course, of course. (To the class.) Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other’s hometowns? Why don’t you… (Motions that they should learn everyone’s hometown.) (To Phoebe) Wh-what’s going on?",
        "Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler?",
        "Phoebe, you said it was urgent!",
        "Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?",
        "Uh, Phoebe…",
        "Phoebe, what are you doing?",
        "Phoebe!",
        "Phoebe, you can’t massage people in my apartment!",
        "And they knew about it?",
        "Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!",
        "The big deal is I don’t want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle—beer! Cold beer.",
        "Hello.",
        "Uh no-no, she-she’s out for the night.",
        "Can I, can I help you with something?",
        "(deadpan) Yes I am.",
        "Okay! Now, I’m going to touch you. (He does so, very gingerly.) Ohh, that’s soft. (He starts poking him and notices his salad spoons and starts to massage him with those.)",
        "(sitting down) Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?",
        "(takes a drink) Damn, this coffee’s cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins? (Joey and he both laugh.)",
        "So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?",
        "(chases her) Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines! (Realizes a table of women overheard him.) (To that table.) ‘Sup?",
        "(looking at the table) Excuse me ladies. (To Phoebe) I’m sorry?",
        "(incredulous) I gave him an extremely professional massage!",
        "Okay, so it wasn’t uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him acu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.",
        "Hey, y’know what? This is your fault! You’re the one that didn’t move his-his appointment.",
        "He said he liked that!! Oh you’re right, you’re right. I’m sorry.",
        "His daughter was hot.",
        "Ohhhh…",
        "It wasn’t the best.",
        "Well, the lighting was okay.",
        "Oh great! That means I’m stuck with, \"So, we were watching you in there (Points to the TV) and you were sittin’ right here! Whoa!\"",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Oh, nothin’ much. Just trying to figure out what I’m gonna do for dinner.",
        "(notices the table) Hey—Ooh! What’s-what’s that, dinner stuff? You making dinner?",
        "What you got over there? Tacos?",
        "Uhh, those are tacos.",
        "Eh, either way I’ll pass. (Quietly to Chandler) I still can’t eat those. (Monica is getting something out of the fridge and starts laughing.) What’s so funny?!",
        "(To Chandler) You told her!",
        "(To Monica) Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It’s not like I chose to do it! It’s not like—It’s not like I said, \"Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!\"",
        "(To Chandler) How could you tell her?!",
        "Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.",
        "Well, Chandler and I are in a bar…",
        "And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you’re thinking, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you’re right, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with…girls.",
        "Oh Mon, I laughed so hard…",
        "Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.",
        "All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!",
        "Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!",
        "Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she’d made.",
        "Monica couldn’t tell time ‘til she was 13!",
        "Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!",
        "Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.",
        "And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!",
        "And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.",
        "Okay, (gets up) if you’ll excuse me, I-I’m gonna go hang out with some people who don’t know the Space Mountain story.",
        "Man! (Monica mouths, \"I’m sorry.\")",
        "About what?",
        "Well, you-you’ve always had glasses.",
        "Are you sure?",
        "(entering from the bathrooms) Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?",
        "No, why?",
        "My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.",
        "Yeah and he didn’t really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.",
        "No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.",
        "Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You’re not a lefty?",
        "Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?",
        "No one got me an engagement present.",
        "Two! I’ve been engaged twice!",
        "(entering with Chandler) Hey.",
        "Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand…",
        "And what did he ask you not to call him?",
        "Over here. (You can see Ross sitting at the far wall.)",
        "‘Cause otherwise they’d have to call it the room room.",
        "Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?",
        "Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.",
        "Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?",
        "You were trying to eat it!",
        "Whoa-whoa, aren’t you a little over dressed?",
        "(To Rachel) Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?",
        "Thank you!",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeeeeeep… Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took me out on her dad’s boat she wouldn’t let me help at all.",
        "You have to respect the sea! (Storms off.)",
        "Let’s give it a shot.",
        "Oh, these are pretty good.",
        "Which one was that?",
        "Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. (Burps a little bit.) I’m okay.",
        "Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh… (Grabs a cookie and takes a big bite out of it and doesn’t like it.) It’s batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way! (Gets up and runs for the bathroom.)",
        "Looking up?",
        "Aww, Pheeb, come on isn’t there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?",
        "That’s the day you’re gonna die? See—darnit, I’ve got shuffleboard that day.",
        "(To Chandler) Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh…",
        "Amazing!",
        "Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy? We call him Hums While He Pees.",
        "It’s not a club.",
        "Hey, divorced men are not bad men!",
        "Soon he’ll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.",
        "Maybe I should open a divorced men’s club.",
        "I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.",
        "I like this one. (Points to it.) It seems to say, \"I love you and that’s why I have to kill you.\"",
        "Yeah?",
        "What?! No!",
        "Look, I don’t think so Pheebs. (Pause) All right, I’ll do it. But just because you’re a friend. (Grabs the tickets and heads to divert Whitney.)",
        "All right! I want my key back!",
        "It’s right there! (Points to her hand.)",
        "Look, I’m sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs.",
        "Oh yeah—No—You’re welcome. We’ll talk about it later.",
        "Hi Whitney.",
        "Yep. (Phoebe slams the door shut.) Okay.",
        "(opens the door and to Whitney) Hi! I’m sorry, but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night?",
        "Okay. (Closes the door.) (To Phoebe) I did divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay?",
        "Yes! That’s where we realized we were both super cool people!",
        "Like what?",
        "Okay.",
        "Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast I’ll be on full alert for room painting and s*x weapons.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex-husband’s gonna say that stuff. Now, if you’ll excuse me…",
        "Hi.",
        "Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay—and F.Y.I she must’ve shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was, \"I don’t give a tiny rat’s ass.\"",
        "Well, I don’t think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that’s just because I am not emotionally unavailable!",
        "I think he can be.",
        "Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!",
        "(angrily) I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!",
        "So do we!! So do we!! (Ross notices a couple has been staring at them.) I’m sorry you had to see that.",
        "My God!",
        "Well maybe she wouldn’t have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!",
        "Wh-what’s up?",
        "Oh just say it Kyle!",
        "(To Whitney) Y’know, he hums when he pees!",
        "It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.",
        "That’s all right, we-we don’t need you. In fact, hey I’m over it already.",
        "(To Phoebe) I’m sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y’know, she did try to use s*x as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a little.",
        "Yeah, we're better off without them.",
        "Divorced men’s club.",
        "Joey, we just saw it!",
        "And it’ll be cool to see it again! Yeah!",
        "Die Hard!!!!!!",
        "Dude, you didn’t say Die Hard. Is everything okay?",
        "Well, John McClane had plans!",
        "What happened?!!",
        "We fell asleep! That is all.",
        "I think that would be best.",
        "Okay. But not about this!",
        "No touch! No touch!",
        "Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio.",
        "Just uh, brought back your videos.",
        "No! No we don’t!",
        "I… I don’t know what you are talking about.",
        "I’ve had better.",
        "All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!",
        "I’ve said it! Okay?! But it’s over Joey!",
        "We can’t do it again.",
        "Because it’s weird!",
        "Sure, what do you got?",
        "No, 10 is the highest.",
        "Because it’s the highest. (Joey shrugs his shoulders) Okay, Rachel you’re up first. (Rachel stands up and gets ready.) Situation No. 1: You’re with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go! (Joey is playing the part of Monica.)",
        "Yes, very nice Rachel.",
        "(playing the drunk uncle) When Monica was a little girl, I remember that—(Phoebe screams and tackles him)—Ooh!! Ow! Very good!",
        "It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.",
        "Go!",
        "Yeah, it really was!",
        "Okay Phoebe, I guess you’re next (To Joey) although I really don’t see the point.",
        "I’m sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.",
        "Actually, it wasn’t that close.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Why-why would I care about that?",
        "It really was.",
        "(slowly stands up and says quietly) Excuse me. (Exits.)",
        "You sure?",
        "No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it’s all yours. (Ross pushes him off.)",
        "Yes! Yes! Yes!! (Everyone stands and claps.)",
        "Yeah.",
        "(shocked) What?!",
        "Ohh.",
        "That is so unfair!",
        "Mine stole my newspaper! It’s like a crime wave!! (Monica runs to make more candy.) Pheebs, you uh, you got a second.",
        "Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a first bike, so…",
        "You like it?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Ahh.",
        "Ah! (She hugs him.) Well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, y’know give it a test ride.",
        "(stunned at the compliment) You’re welcome.",
        "Phoebe really likes the bike huh?",
        "Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?",
        "Pheebs you uh…you do know how to ride a bike don’t you?",
        "Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you’ll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready…Set…",
        "Phoebe, you can’t get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!",
        "Well…In-in case of emergency.",
        "Well let there—what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, \"You ride this bike or I’ll sh…I’ll shoot you.\"",
        "Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and—Hey! I’ll hold you up and-and push you. Okay?",
        "No!",
        "I swear!",
        "Come on. (She gets on the bike.) All right, here we go. All right? (They start.)",
        "All right. Feel good?",
        "All right, try pedaling.",
        "That’s it, your doing great.",
        "Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!",
        "Yes!! Yes!!! (He starts clapping and Phoebe turns around to look at him and falls off the bike.)",
        "I-I just thought you were doing so well. I…",
        "It’s a legitimate learning technique. (Looking around and seeing the woman behind him glaring at him.) Wow!",
        "Hey, there’s uh, some people outside, askin’ about candy.",
        "Need some help?",
        "By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me. (She glares at him and he quickly makes his way to Phoebe’s room.)",
        "(entering) Look, I-I’m really sorry I let go of the bike.",
        "I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe!",
        "Phoebe.",
        "All right, y’know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I’m sorry, I’m just gonna have to take it back.",
        "Because! Because, it-it-it’s… It’d be like you having this guitar (Points to hers) and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don’t ride it you-you’re-you’re killing its spirit! (Pause) The bike is dying.",
        "Great! Great! (He runs to the door.) You’re making the bike very happy.",
        "Oh hey, don’t thank me, thank yourself. You’re the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.",
        "Okay, okay take a guess.",
        "Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y’know-y’know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It’s here! Yeah, it’s right-it’s right down here! In the biggest library in the university! (They start heading that way, towards a secluded section behind the racks.)",
        "(stopping quickly) Oh umm, there’s also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. (They both laugh, but stop when the hear moaning coming from the next aisle.) What is that?",
        "People are doing it in front of my book!",
        "My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin’ babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!",
        "Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.",
        "Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it’s like uh-a thing!",
        "Oh for cryin’ out loud! (He storms out.)",
        "Excuse me. Hi, I’m a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?",
        "No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?! (The librarian brings his boss over.)",
        "Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.",
        "Well, fine. Fine! If-if I’m the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I’ll go up there and defend it myself! (Starts to do so, but stops and to the previous librarian) And don’t you follow me!",
        "Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?",
        "Oh-oh, you’re-you’re fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for, hmm? Perhaps, (Grabs a book from the shelf behind him) perhaps Dr. Chester Stock’s musings on the Smiledon Californicus?",
        "Ah… Ah…Get out of here! (The couple retreats. Ross starts looking through the previously mentioned book as a beautiful woman walks into the section.) Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion’s views on evolution?",
        "I find Marion’s views far too progressionist.",
        "I’m a professor here uh, Ross…Geller.",
        "Yes! You’re the person who checked out my book?!",
        "Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.",
        "I am very…very sorry.",
        "(to the guard) Don’t sweat it, I’ve got this section covered. Yeah, in fact I’ve got this little baby (Turns on a mini-flashlight) to shine in people’s eye—(The guard walks away)—Okay, see you later.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "(Thinking it over) Sure! (Takes one) Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year.",
        "Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do ya?",
        "Well, I do, so let's... (Ben and Ross sit down on the couch) So, Ben, you uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?",
        "Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?",
        "Yes, but also (Pauses to let Ben answer, but he doesn’t.) Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.",
        "Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.",
        "(interrupts him) Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh (Sings) Draydl, draydl, draydl, I made you out of clay.",
        "(interrupts him again) Okay, it's not a contest.",
        "Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?",
        "No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.",
        "No, hey-hey, come on, (He grabs Ben and sits him on his lap) Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!",
        "(disappointed) Yes! Santa's coming!",
        "Hey!",
        "No, these are my pants.",
        "Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?",
        "Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I…uh, you gotta have something.",
        "I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you (Points to Ben) a Merry Christmas!",
        "(to Monica) Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.",
        "That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. (He tries to bend down to pick up the bag with the presents, but can't because of the costume) Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.",
        "You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!",
        "(gasps) You are? Me, too!",
        "(to Monica) You wanna wander in the hall? (to Ben) Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?",
        "Yeah!",
        "Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...",
        "What are you doing here, Santa?",
        "I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?",
        "(to Chandler) What are you doing?",
        "Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.",
        "Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you’re wrecking it.",
        "I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.",
        "Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!",
        "Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.",
        "All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.",
        "…and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should’ve just lasted just one day, burned for…",
        "That’s right, and that’s why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.",
        "Yeah?",
        "The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it’s time to light the Hanukkah candles! (Santa, Superman, Monica, Ben, and the Holiday Armadillo go over to the menorah to light the candles.)",
        "Come on, come on, we’re-we’re-we’re lighting the candles!",
        "(entering) Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!",
        "What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?",
        "What? That's like insanely easy!",
        "What? You forgot fourteen states?",
        "Wow, how many have you got?",
        "Done! With time-a to spare.",
        "You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called \"a globe?\" Hmm?",
        "What? That's impossible.",
        "No, just give me another minute.",
        "This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.",
        "You're on!",
        "Pshhshhh!",
        "Phoebe, why is your bag moving?",
        "Ohio!! Thank you!",
        "What dog? There-there's no dog here.",
        "Are you out of your mind?",
        "Right, they are scary. (He jumps up, screaming) Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!",
        "It's too cold.",
        "(to Phoebe) It hurts my teeth.",
        "How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.",
        "Damn, I forgot you were here.",
        "Hey! What's she doing back here?",
        "Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...",
        "Yeah, but, but look what I'm...",
        "Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.",
        "Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.",
        "No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.",
        "Because you sent away the dog!",
        "Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend…Phyllis…take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.",
        "From you? (He does a weird desperate laughter, like he's almost crying) Yes, please!",
        "I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.",
        "Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.",
        "Tag? Y-You're going? (Comes over to Tag) Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?",
        "Ah, what good are you. (Walks back to his map dejectedly.)",
        "Delaware! (Starting to cry.) Delaware!",
        "(hands Chandler his pad and walks in) I want my turkey now!",
        "(pauses) I know.",
        "Well, technically it started seven billion years ago… (Well, technically you’d be able to see it for days, well nights; that is if you could see it with all of the bright lights of New York.)",
        "Okay! Okay! Fine, I’ll stop! No teaching, okay? We’ll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky. (Comets don’t streak across the sky, meteors do.) Okay? Who’s official name is Bapstein-King.",
        "Man, look at all those stars! (Yeah, you can see what? Five of them from the city?) Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesn’t it?",
        "Huh?",
        "What?",
        "What? Is it the comet? (Runs over to where Joey’s standing.)",
        "Joey come—I can’t believe—I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of nature’s most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!",
        "Show me where?",
        "(noticing the pipe and looking at the door) Joey where’s the pipe that was holding the door open?",
        "Joey!",
        "It’s called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? (Joey starts to groan.) Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!",
        "Rachel!! Monica!!",
        "I can’t believe this!!",
        "(standing at the edge of the roof) Yeah, I guess we don’t have a choice. (Screaming to the street) Help us! Please help us! We’re stuck up on the roof and we can’t get down!!!",
        "(To Joey) I know, I wasn’t finished. (Joey motions him to finish.) (Yelling at the street) But don’t worry! We’re gonna go down the fire escape!!",
        "Ugh. Well, we’re just gonna have to jump. (Joey looks at him.) Yeah. Now, we’re gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there…you go up to the roof and you let me in.",
        "Yeah! Oh yeah, you’ll be fine! It-it’ll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y’know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won’t.",
        "Well, I’m not gonna lie to you Joey, it’s a possibility.",
        "Oh, all right. (Joey flips the coin.) Tails! (The coin bounces off of the landing above them and falls to the ground.) Can you-can you see what it is?",
        "Okay. Well, you be careful.",
        "Well I’m not jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won’t have a father if-if I die!",
        "(looking in the window behind them) Y’know, y’know I’m lookin’ and I don’t think anyone’s home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y’know explain later.",
        "I don’t think so. Hello? (Knocks on the glass, which angers the big, large, angry dog behind the glass and causes them to jump to the other side of the landing.) When you get in there… (Joey nods his disapproval.)",
        "Okay, do-do you have a good grip?",
        "Okay, I’m going to start climb down you now.",
        "Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we’re face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face.",
        "I would say that.",
        "Okay, here I go.",
        "I prefer not to answer that right now, I’m still carrying a little holiday weight.",
        "So what do you want me to do?",
        "Hi.",
        "(looking down) M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.",
        "It’s still looks pretty far!",
        "Do not rush me!!",
        "Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I—Ooh, a quarter!",
        "Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?",
        "Thanks. (Phoebe gets up to get a refill.) (To Monica) Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?",
        "Cousin Frannie’s wedding, it's tomorrow night.",
        "No.",
        "Well l-look okay, it’s probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.",
        "Y’know, she tried to undress me too.",
        "Hey, y’know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron! (Monica shakes her head in disgust.)",
        "Phoebe he’s right, that is the rule.",
        "Hey Joe, while you’re over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn’t a mistake. Ahh, there’s-there’s limited seating in the hall.",
        "Well yeah, but she doesn’t know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would’ve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.",
        "Oh what’s the big deal?! I wasn’t even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y’know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we’ll-we’ll leave early as a sign of protest.",
        "Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She’s an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!",
        "(interrupting) Not broad backed!",
        "What? I can’t cancel on Joan!",
        "Bec—Did you not hear me?! She’s an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They’re wild! Why do you want to come anyway?",
        "Okay, all right, I’ll take you. I’ll go call Joan. (Does so.)",
        "Oh here, I think this is us. (Reading the name cards.) Yeah.",
        "(To Monica) Stop saying, \"Blood\" to strangers.",
        "Oh, hey Aunt Millie.",
        "Yes, yes it is. It’s uh… (Aunt Millie uses this opportunity to grab Ross and kiss him on the lips. After she leaves Ross quickly wipes his mouth with a napkin.) Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!",
        "Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn’t bring you here so you can ambush her.",
        "That bitch! (He gets up and they go over to ambush Frannie. Monica taps on Frannie’s shoulder.)",
        "(to Frannie) Hi Frannie, congratulations.",
        "So it’s really a question of who could you have possibly done.",
        "What? Oh, okay. Wait here. (Goes to get it, but before he gets there Aunt Millie sits down on it forcing him to pull it out from behind her which gets her attention.)",
        "Well…",
        "Why?! Why on the lips?! (He wipes his mouth on Monica’s wrap and walks off, leaving Aunt Millie stunned.)",
        "Hey, y’know what’s weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you’re gonna have to say, \"This is my brother-in-law Ross.\" Not, \"My friend Ross,\" \"brother-in-law Ross.\" That’s weird isn’t it?",
        "(disappointed) Sure, do whatever you want.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Oh, it looks like mom and dad’s house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is…Oh my God!!",
        "I can’t believe they-they didn’t even tell us!",
        "(on phone) Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper! (Listens) Yes we’re surprised! (Listens) Who did you leave a message with?",
        "I can’t believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger’s gonna be living in my room.",
        "They kept your room for a while.",
        "Come on, you know they love you.",
        "I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It’s not my fault.",
        "Hey.",
        "What’s wrong with this year?",
        "Hey, y’know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.",
        "What?",
        "Dad?",
        "(entering with Monica) Hey!",
        "Dad, we-we can’t believe you’re selling the house.",
        "(To Monica) Let’s grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.",
        "Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.",
        "Wow! Great! (Finds a pack of cigarettes.) Wait, dad who-who’s cigarettes are these?",
        "Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad, (reading his grades) Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym…(He puts it away and finds something else.) Oooh, my rock polisher!",
        "It’s a clown kit! Clown kit!",
        "What?",
        "How are you ever going to sell this place?",
        "Oh no. Dad! Dad! What…(He goes to open one of her boxes and it rips apart.) Oh God…everything’s ruined! Dad, she’s gonna be crushed!",
        "No!",
        "Dad that won’t matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.",
        "Well, can you blame her?",
        "Dad, dad I don’t want to hear about it.",
        "Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we’re gonna give her some! Okay, grab…grab some empty boxes. Okay? We’ll-we’ll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we’ll-we’ll put ‘em in their.",
        "Like uh y’know like this! This! (He picks up one of those art projects that kids make in kindergarten and first grade.) She-she could’ve made this!",
        "Right? And this! (He picks up a trophy) She-she could’ve won this!",
        "Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?",
        "Hey.",
        "(overacting as well) Yeah! Yeah! (Laughs.) Oh, this will make a great memory.",
        "Well, these. These are yours right here. (Pointing to the boxes they just created for her.)",
        "Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.",
        "Nu-uh! (Grabs it and examines it.)",
        "Oh, I don’t know how that got in there.",
        "Umm, your boxes are umm…",
        "Dad?",
        "All right. I think it was a mouse.",
        "(even more shocked) What?!!!",
        "Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!",
        "Well, what about me?! I’m a medical marvel!!",
        "Happy birthday!!!",
        "We’ve got presents!",
        "Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?",
        "Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?",
        "Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!",
        "How hot do I look in this, huh?!",
        "That’s not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.",
        "(giddy) I don’t know, but-but look how shiny!",
        "Hop in. (Phoebe hops in.) Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.",
        "Damnit! (Shuts the car off.)",
        "Okay, forward. Forward—Stop! (The car moves an inch and Ross runs to the back of the car.) Okay, back—Stop! (The car barely moves and Ross runs back to the front.) Okay, forward—Stop! Stop! Stop!",
        "No-no-no! It’s mine! It’s-it’s mine. (The woman walks away.)",
        "Maybe that will liven up this party.",
        "(to Tag) Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.",
        "Hey! Look who’s back! It’s the birthday girl! How’s the birthday girl feeling?",
        "What? (Glances over and sees the faces of the rest of the group, then goes and sits down.)",
        "Which is fine! Because you just turned—(Removes two candles from the cake)—twenty-eight!",
        "(To Monica) You’re drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I’m a little drunk.",
        "I really wish that you wouldn’t.",
        "Come on!",
        "Okay, is everybody clear? We’re gonna pick it up…and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We’re gonna lift the car…and slide it out. Lift and slide!",
        "(interrupting her) Lift!! And slide!",
        "All right everyone, lift! (They try to lift the car, of course it doesn’t raise up) And slide!! (Everyone leans over, but the car still does not move.)",
        "God, do you realize in ten years we’re gonna be 40?",
        "Yes! My baby’s finally free!",
        "(starting it) Woohoo!",
        "You wanna buy a car?",
        "What’s the matter? You okay?",
        "Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.",
        "Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.",
        "Sorry, I’m kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.",
        "What? A brain transplant?!",
        "It’s ridiculous!",
        "(to Monica and Rachel) It’s winter, they are fewer people on the street. (Rachel and Monica smile and nod, knowingly.)",
        "Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the \"brain transplant,\" you are going to be her?",
        "What?!",
        "Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.",
        "Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more…",
        "How did you know about that?!",
        "Were you the ones called the cops?!",
        "Why not?",
        "Come on that’s not fair! I mean you haven’t even heard me play!",
        "No, you’ve heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I’m not going to tell you what song I’m gonna play either. But uh, let’s just say when it’s over I’ll bet there will be a wee bit o’ celebration.",
        "…now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.",
        "(To Rachel) Do you wanna start telling secrets?",
        "(stands up) Now umm, remember I’m still learning.",
        "One, two, three, four!",
        "You know the song! Sing along!",
        "So?",
        "You know the song! Sing along!",
        "Hi.",
        "Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency.",
        "Uh, before we do uh, are any of Joey’s special romance magazines in there?",
        "(to Ben) Okay! All clear!",
        "(to Ben) Everything okay in there?",
        "Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean’s office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?",
        "Oh, she isn’t home.",
        "Well, Ben would be there.",
        "What’s the matter?",
        "Rach, he’s not an ex-con.",
        "I don’t know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.",
        "Okay. (Ben enters) Ben? Come here. All right, I’m gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay?",
        "(To Rachel) I wasn’t talking to you.",
        "Okay, I’ll see you soon buddy. (He hugs and kisses him.) Be back in an hour.",
        "I have a bone to pick with you.",
        "Yes! Ben learned a little trick.",
        "That’s right! That’s right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!",
        "Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They’re mean and they’re stupid and-and I don’t want my son learning them!",
        "I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?",
        "Rachel! What are you doing here?",
        "Your good friend?",
        "What’s her last name?",
        "Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?",
        "Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh, (In a college frat boy voice) \"Dude, don’t you ever wash your face?\"",
        "Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it’s not funny!",
        "Hi.",
        "Practical jokes.",
        "You have a line down your face.",
        "Uh, y’know what? I’ll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal’s office wearing nothing but a catcher’s mitt!",
        "I will be! Listen, I don’t want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?",
        "No that’s not what I want. Uh, I’m glad you guys were bonding but I…",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey I’m sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I’ve got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for his uh, ‘Fun Aunt’ Rachel, so…",
        "Okay, I’ll see you later pal.",
        "What?",
        "What? (She takes the sign off and hands it to him.) That’s great. That is great. (Crumples up the paper and throws it down in anger.) What did we just finish talking about Ben?!",
        "All right, that’s it! (He runs over to Ben, who runs past him and out the door.) Come—you—no! You are in big trouble young man!",
        "Wait! No! Ben, come here! I am not kidding!",
        "I-I-am—(Suddenly Ross starts screaming and comes falling down the stairs landing just in front of Rachel.)",
        "She seems really, really fun!",
        "What?!",
        "So that’s two of my wives.",
        "Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding! (Holding up his garment bag.)",
        "No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman’s tux!",
        "That’s right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film…that Batman film he was in.",
        "So?",
        "Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.",
        "Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.",
        "When I got married you slept with my sister.",
        "Hey!",
        "Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.",
        "Gunther. (To Chandler) Hey-hey! Why don’t we put them on? Y’know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.",
        "Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.",
        "What, are you kidding? It’s Batman’s tux!!",
        "Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin’ in there.",
        "What?",
        "Let me see that! (Grabs the invitation and reads it.) Oh man!",
        "(noticing a beautiful woman moving in down the street) Well hello! She’s cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?",
        "Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you.",
        "(exhales) I got it. (He lifts the box and grunts under the strain.) (Calmly) So hi, I’m uh, I’m Ross and this is my friend Chandler. (He shyly waves.)",
        "Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, ‘cause if you are…I’d love to show you around sometime.",
        "Ah.",
        "Y’know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. (Kristen crinkles her nose at that.) Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep! (He stops when he realizes what he’s talking about.)",
        "Umm, say you’re gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Great! Uh, let me take this up for you. (The box he’s holding.)",
        "Oh no-no, after you. (She grabs a chair and heads upstairs.) (When she’s gone.) Oh my God! (He drops the box and Chandler can’t pick it up.)",
        "Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she’d like to go out again.",
        "Yeah in fact, I’m gonna go call her right now. And I’ll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says… (He mimics the shy reaction Chandler did.)",
        "(returning) Hey.",
        "Oh great! We’re going out again Saturday. But I just found she’s also seeing some other guy.",
        "Well you shouldn’t be. Believe me I wouldn’t want to be the guy who’s up against you. (Chandler laughs.) I mean that doofus is going to lose!",
        "Kristen Lang.",
        "Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.",
        "Well now let’s-let’s look at this objectively, I think I should date her…",
        "That’s interesting, but check this out. I date her…",
        "Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.",
        "No Joey! Look why don’t, why don’t we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we’ll each go out with her one more time. And-and we’ll see who she likes best.",
        "Maybe I’ll take her to that new French restaurant down the street…",
        "Well sorry, that’s what I do on dates.",
        "So let’s decide on the spending limit…",
        "I was thinking more like a hundred.",
        "Hey! What’s up?",
        "Oh thanks!",
        "We have 8:00 reservations at Gramercy Bistro.",
        "I am dressed.",
        "I have an oily T-zone!",
        "That’s right.",
        "Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically, technically I didn’t break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.",
        "Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?",
        "Why am I not surprised?",
        "I don’t think you have much choice.",
        "Bye-bye!",
        "Yes. Yes. Just here (Runs his fingers down the bridge of his nose) and there (Runs his fingers across his forehead).",
        "So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh yeah it’s fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasm out of control.",
        "Hi. (They shake hands.) It’s nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I don’t anymore.",
        "Yeah. So…",
        "So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something?",
        "That’s right! That’s right, don’t you play a woman?",
        "Much better.",
        "Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I’ve been married and how I have a son.",
        "That’s right! Wait no, Ben.",
        "Well umm…",
        "Yes. And another time after that. Boy I’m getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you ate some of her food?",
        "No. No.",
        "Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?",
        "Hey you leave Marcel out of this!",
        "Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!",
        "Probably around gonorrhea.",
        "Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we’re gonna have younger looking skin!",
        "…and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the Velociraptor would expand it’s collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it’s predator. (A student raises his hand.) Yes Mr. Lewis?",
        "Just a high pitched intimidating noise.",
        "Well we-we don’t know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded something like this. (He makes a high pitched noise and Alan doesn’t know what to make of it.) Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, that’s uh, that’s all for today. (Everyone starts to get up.) Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?",
        "Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, I’m afraid I-I had to fail you.",
        "Well you need 60% to pass…",
        "Seven.",
        "No-no it’s not. What-what happened there Ned?",
        "Well I’m sorry but, that-that’s really not my problem.",
        "Well that brings me in the loop a little.",
        "Okay! (Walks away from him.) Umm, I uh, I’m your teacher. I’m sorry, you’re-you’re a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs.",
        "Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?",
        "There’s this kid in my class who said he’s in love with me.",
        "I do-I do not have a boyfriend. There’s a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.",
        "Yeah! I don’t know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of…sexy professor vibe? (Rachel and Joey both look at him.)",
        "It-it—The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.",
        "Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.",
        "(turning towards him) Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you?",
        "And why exactly would I do that? (Goes back to writing on the board.)",
        "(turning around and dragging the chalk down the board) What?!",
        "No!",
        "Well that’s different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with me!",
        "What?",
        "I can’t believe someone would do that for a grade.",
        "Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?",
        "Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to know that I’m changing your grade back.",
        "‘Cause I know what you’re trying to pull here. Okay? It’s not gonna work.",
        "Y’know what? I-I’m not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This little thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay—(Ned looks shocked)—Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me feel Ned?! You used me! You don’t love me and you never did! (Ross turns around to make a grand exit but runs into two colleagues.) Ah Professor Winston, Professor Fredrickson, I’ll be right with you. (To Ned) Don’t make this worse and I’ll give you a C. (To the professors) Shall we? (They leave.)",
        "A no s*x pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.",
        "Cassie?",
        "Wow, I haven’t seen her for, like, forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes.",
        "So what! I still have—No you’re probably right.",
        "What—why?",
        "What?! Chandler, she’s our cousin!",
        "Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.",
        "(shocked at her beauty) Cassie?!",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh. Oh, that’s right. So-so you did see me that day, because it seemed like you didn’t.",
        "It’s okay. Come, come on in.",
        "Oh.",
        "Uh-huh. Yeah, I-I have a knack for impressions.",
        "Yeah—No!!",
        "Cassie, how you-how you doin’ on that…hot dog.",
        "(quietly) Thank God.",
        "Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you ‘til you cried? (She laughs) We’re probably too old to do that now.",
        "(looking then moving away quickly) Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I’ll always remember that summer because that’s when I realized that we are related.",
        "Well I’m, I’m a little slow. (To himself) Just as our children would be.",
        "(in his head) She’s your cousin. She’s your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head she’d think you were sick! (She grabs some popcorn.) Or would she? Let’s back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logan’s Run, the sexiest movie ever. (She grabs the blanket from behind him and looks at him.) Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I’m going in.",
        "(in his head) Say something clever! (Pause.) Okay, doesn’t have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. (Pause) Any words will do. (Pause) Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! (Pause) There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! (Pause.) (To her) I-I, I uh haven’t had s*x in a very long time. (She leaves.) (In his head) Yeah, you really shouldn’t have said anything.",
        "Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.",
        "Well, why don’t you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.",
        "...everyone, this is Chandler!",
        "(Screaming) I’m getting married today!! Ahh, whoo-hoo!!(He runs back out the door.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.",
        "How’s Monica coming along with her vows?",
        "I can’t believe that in four weeks they’re gonnta be married!",
        "Phoebe that’s not true.",
        "Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.",
        "(entering) What's going on?",
        "What?! What?!",
        "Actually, it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebe starts jumping to divert his attention.)",
        "(He notices something through the window.) No! No! Wh… What are you doing?!! (Dr. Ledbetter is slowly backing away.) GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
        "It’ll be okay Joe.",
        "That little naked guy would be me.",
        "Yes, yes, fine, that is my pen1s. Can we be grown-ups now?",
        "Got me.",
        "Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile)",
        "(looking) No-no, that would be me again.",
        "(To Chandler) Oh man, this is hilarious.",
        "(quietly) Dude!",
        "Dude! How-how did you write this?",
        "You can’t do that!",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I’d take that bad boy out for a little spin.",
        "It’s a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!",
        "Hey!",
        "Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I’ll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.",
        "Whew! That was a brisk ride!",
        "Only way to fly.",
        "You’re fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.",
        "Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must’ve seen me cruising in the bad boy.",
        "What?! (Checks his hair.) Give-give me a brush.",
        "No way!",
        "Fine! Y’know what? It doesn’t matter, because, if I remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.",
        "What do you think you’re doing?!",
        "There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don’t you just hand over the keys?",
        "No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! (She starts the car.) Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now! (He looks for the twenty Rachel stole and doesn’t find it.)",
        "With you?! Yeah right!",
        "(grabbing the car) Okay! Okay! Okay! (He gets in, but into the back seat.)",
        "In the death seat?!!",
        "(shocked) You don’t have a valid driver’s license—Okay that is it! Pull over right now!",
        "(grabbing the wheel) What-what are you doing?! Are you—Okay that’s not funny! Just stop horsing around!",
        "Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.",
        "I was talking to myself! You’re going down!",
        "Yeah, I’ll get right on that.",
        "No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, I’m sure we won’t get arrested for this.",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Dear Lord!!",
        "Here it comes.",
        "Well she should, it was taken ten years ago!",
        "I can handle the stick!!",
        "Who?",
        "What?! What does he want?! I wasn’t doing anything!",
        "Maybe it’s uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more! (They pull over.)",
        "Good evening officer.",
        "Ah no. I don’t, but it could not have been more than sixty.",
        "I mean you’re not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are ya?",
        "Y’know of-officer I uh…I had the weirdest dream last night…",
        "(laughs) You don’t-you don’t want to hear about my dream Officer…Pretty?",
        "I know. I know.",
        "Oh, where are you guys going?",
        "Ah. Joey, you’re-you’re having lunch with my mom?",
        "(To Chandler) Y’know what? Actually I’m kinda glad they’re leaving ‘cause uh, I need to talk to you about something.",
        "Well this uh, this may be a little awkward.",
        "No, its…Its not that. Umm, now what I’m going to say to you, I’m not saying as your friend. Okay? I’m-I’m saying as it as Monica’s older brother.",
        "Not for the next few minutes.",
        "Nope.",
        "Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldn’t be more thrilled for both of you, but as Monica’s older brother I-I have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, I will hunt you down and kick your ass! (Chandler laughs.) What? I’m-I’m-I’m serious! (Chandler laughs harder.) Come—Hey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? I’m-I’m not kidding here!",
        "No problem.",
        "Yeah.",
        "(walks up) Wow Monica! Hey, just so you know I had my uh, older brother chat with Chandler.",
        "Well I…I told him that if he ever hurt you I would hunt him down and kick his ass! (The girls all laugh.) What?! What?! What is the matter with everybody?! I am serious! I would kick his ass! (The laugh harder.)",
        "Thanks you guys. (Walks away happily and his parents smile.)",
        "(clinking a wine glass) Can I have everyone’s attention please? I’m uh; I’m Ross Geller.",
        "Dad…dad, please! As I was saying umm, I’m Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh, and I’m the best man. And uh, this marriage is doubly special for me umm, because not only is the groom my best friend but uh, the bride is my little sister. And, she’s the greatest sister a guy could ask for. So if you’d all please join me in raising a glass to the, the couple we’re here to celebrate. (Everyone does so.) To the Bings.",
        "Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel.",
        "What? Are you going back to work?",
        "Nice shades.",
        "And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!",
        "Hey, where’s Chandler?",
        "(going up to Rachel’s closed door) Chandler? (He opens the door and looks inside and doesn’t see him.) Chandler? (He checks the bathroom and still doesn’t find him. He then finds a note on the counter. He picks it up and reads it.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Is uh, is Monica here?",
        "I think Chandler’s gone. (He hands her the note.)",
        "He left that.",
        "I think it means he freaked out and left!",
        "Look—Okay, I’m just gonna—I’m gonna have to go find him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?",
        "(scared) I will, I will find him.",
        "Gunther have you uh, have you seen Chandler?",
        "Oh damn!",
        "Yes. Yes. Don’t worry. Everything’s fine. We’ll uh, we’ll see you tomorrow at the wedding.",
        "Well then, we’ll-we’ll see you the day after tomorrow. (Walks away slowly, but notices something.) Mom?! Dad?! (They’re sitting by the window.) What-what…what you guys doing here?!",
        "Why?!",
        "(shocked) Gunther?!",
        "What? Your-your list?",
        "Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know I’m looking for him?",
        "No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn’t heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandler’s parents again!",
        "No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I’m interested in them.",
        "No! Hey! Hey! We can’t!",
        "Well, can’t you at least stall her a little? I’ll-I’ll go back to some of the places I went last night.",
        "Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?",
        "Give me two.",
        "Okay, wish me luck.",
        "Why?!",
        "We are never gonna find him! He’s one guy in a huge city!",
        "That is an old, Chinese woman!",
        "Aw, y’know…Y’know, maybe we’re-we’re just approaching this all wrong. If you’re Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you’d go?",
        "So this is your office?",
        "She’s fine. She doesn’t know you’re gone. And she doesn’t have to know, okay? Now come on, we’re going home.",
        "What’s wrong with being the Bings?",
        "Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?",
        "Then you are neither of your parents!",
        "Y’know, okay. You’re right. It is huge. So why don’t we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?",
        "(interrupting him) Yeah—No-but-but-but-but! We’re just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that’s not scary right?",
        "There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasn’t so scary, was it?",
        "I’m telling you, just a little bit at a time.",
        "Getting married. (Chandler panics.) Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that too! Just like you’ve done everything else!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Wh—Hey—Whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!",
        "Okay.",
        "Hi! (To Mrs. Bing) Hi! (Mr. Bing starts rubbing his arm.) Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?",
        "He-he was with me umm, we’re playing a little game, y’know? Hide and seek.",
        "(pause) You’re right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.",
        "Oh my God! Monica!",
        "Great. He’s doing great. Don’t you worry about Chandler.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "These-these are beads of joy.",
        "Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?",
        "Chandler’s gone again!",
        "(turning a corner) There he is!!",
        "You’re not getting away this time mister! Unless you want that ass kicking we talked about!",
        "Hiiii-Ya!! (Chandler lies back down.) I’m serious! You’re not walking out on my sister!",
        "Then where the hell have you been?!",
        "What?",
        "What?! What?! Talking about what?!",
        "Know what—If somebody doesn’t tell me what’s going on right now…",
        "Oh my God. Oh my God! And you’re-you’re…you’re not freaking out?",
        "Cigarettes?!!",
        "Dude. (Hugs him.)",
        "Huh. This is nice.",
        "I’ve never walked down the aisle knowing it can’t end in divorce.",
        "Rings?",
        "(To Monica) Okay, I know I’m not supposed to know, but I do. And I’m so excited for you!",
        "Monica’s pregnant!",
        "What?! What do you mean? You-you-you’re not pregnant?",
        "No! (Pause) I’ll be right back. (Exits.)",
        "Hi. I’m uh, I’m Ross. I don’t, I don’t believe we’ve met. I’m Monica’s older brother.",
        "Oh! Hello uh, Mona from her restaurant. (He uses his card to mouth those words.) (Pause) Mona, wow what a, what a beautiful name.",
        "Aw come on, Mona Lisa?",
        "Mona umm…Clickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no she’s uh—well she’s dead now. No, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world.",
        "Linda Clickclocken. (Pause) So what uh, what-what table are you at? (She shows him.) Oh, uh me too.",
        "(sexily) Yes there will. (Mona leaves and Ross tries to find the same table.) Oh guess what, Molly Gilbert you’ve just been bumped up to table one. And if it’s all right with you I’m gonna take your place at table six—Martin Clickclocken.",
        "Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six.",
        "Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way (he turns her hand upside down) which uh, which was misleading. Well I’m… (He goes at sits down at his new table and the kids stare at him.) Hello.",
        "It was the chair again! Okay? I’m not doing it! It what—look, I don’t—y’know what—eh-eh… (He walks away and goes over to Mona.) Hi.",
        "Umm, would you like to dance?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Oh great! (They get up to dance and Ross is interrupted by a little girl.)",
        "I wasn’t farting! (To Mona) Uh, a little game from our table. (To the little girl) Yes?",
        "Oh umm, well uh, maybe-maybe later. Right now, I’m about to dance with this lady.",
        "Uh, unless! Unless, uh this lady wouldn’t mind letting you go first.",
        "Yes I-I am. In fact umm hey, why don’t we try it my special way? You can dance on my feet.",
        "Yeah? Hop on. (They start dancing and Mona sits down.) Is the pretty lady looking?",
        "Keep dancing.",
        "No-no, thank you Miranda.",
        "All right. (Walks over to Mona.)",
        "Oh-oh, were you, were you watching?",
        "What? Of course you can! Hop on!",
        "I am so gonna score.",
        "I like your bow.",
        "(to the second girl) That was very nice Ashley.",
        "No-no. (Walks over to Mona again.)",
        "Oh! (Recoils in horror.)",
        "Oh, you-you sure? (She nods yes.) Okay. (To the girl) Okay. So what’s uh, what’s your name.",
        "That’s, that’s pretty. (They start to dance and Gert tries to step on Ross’s feet, but he pulls them out of harm’s way.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing there Gert?",
        "Okay. (Swallows hard.) Hop on Gert. (She does and Ross winces in pain.)",
        "I’m trying. (He strains to move his feet.)",
        "Maybe I should stand on your feet! (Gert’s shocked and Ross realizes what he said and tries to brush it off.)",
        "I just didn’t see the fast song coming.",
        "Oh, thank you.",
        "Wait a minute! No! I’m the nice one! I’m the one who danced with the kids all night! How…How small are your feet?! (They all look down.)",
        "Hi.",
        "Why not? It’s built into the price of the room.",
        "Thread!",
        "What disposable cameras?",
        "No you didn’t.",
        "Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, \"Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?\" (Chandler laughs.) Yeah, then you did that.",
        "No. Sorry man.",
        "Well, I’m sure they’re still somewhere here in the hotel. I’ll-I’ll help you look for them.",
        "In-in three minutes.",
        "Chandler?",
        "No. Did you?",
        "Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-one’s turned them.",
        "Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?",
        "I’m sorry man. (Formally dressed people start to enter.) Here’s a thought. This is the same ballroom. There’s a band. There’s gonna be plenty of dressed up people.",
        "No-no-no, I’m saying we-we buy more of this (disposable cameras) at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else’s faces.",
        "I’m just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?",
        "I’m telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren’t these the same flowers?",
        "What about the chairs?",
        "How about the place settings?",
        "What did you do?",
        "Hmm. (They head off to the gift shop.)",
        "I heard it. I heard it.",
        "Okay. Okay!",
        "Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre please see the front desk? Your car is about to be towed.",
        "A ’95 LeSabre?!",
        "A green LeSabre?",
        "I’m sorry, I meant a blue LeSabre.",
        "Well go! Go move it! (He runs off.)",
        "Yeah.",
        "Now you are going to love these.",
        "Huh, didn’t see that coming.",
        "Well, I’m gonna go get these (the floral bouquet he walked in with) in some water.",
        "No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby. Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming. (Starts to leave.) Hey! My sweater! I’ve been looking for this for like a month!",
        "Hey! How you doing?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh hey, right back at ya.",
        "Yeah. She—Well, she’s one crazy lady?",
        "(shows Tag his sweater tag) Umm, I don’t some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later.",
        "He is so weird.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "No why?",
        "Oh well, I guess I’ll catch up with her later.",
        "Oh no.",
        "I think I might know what this is about.",
        "Yeah. Uh, uh we promised we weren’t gonna tell anybody this but uh, about a month ago Rachel and I slept together.",
        "Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked.",
        "Well, we-we said we’d just do it that one time but, but now I think she may wanna start things up again.",
        "Why? What-what else could it be?",
        "I’m telling you. I’m telling you. That’s what it is. No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn’t say anything to you?",
        "Yeah, I guess I should. (Starts to leave.) Man, y’know what I have to realize? Maybe I’m just not the type of guy women can have just one night with. Y’know, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that. (He pauses and then exits.)",
        "Hi.",
        "(quietly confident) I think we do. Why don’t we go inside? (They go inside.) Look uh, I know why you’re here.",
        "Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first.",
        "Okay. (He sits her down in a chair.) Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That’s been one heck of a see-saw hasn’t it?",
        "I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and…and certainly passionate, but don’t you think it’s better if we just stayed friends?",
        "Okay. Okay. Y’know what? If you want to, we can do it one more time. I mean I’d-I’d be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now.",
        "Oh sure. (He sits on the apothecary table and touches her hand.)",
        "I’m good. I’m good.",
        "Yeah, I need uh… I’m just—I don’t know—I don’t understand, umm, how this happened? We-we used a condom.",
        "What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!",
        "No they don’t!!! (He runs to the bedroom to check and returns with his box of condoms.) Well they should put it in huge black letters!!!!",
        "Oh well I may as well have!",
        "Freaked out? Hey no, I’m not freaked out! I’m indignant! As a consumer!",
        "No! No! I want to talk now! Okay? I—In fact, (picks up the phone) I am going to talk to the president of the condom company!",
        "(grabs her) Shh! Shh! Shh!",
        "(on phone) Yeah I’ll press 1! (Presses one which allows Rachel to escape.)",
        "Hi.",
        "Sure.",
        "Namaste. (Bows.)",
        "Oh my God! What happened to the door?!",
        "Look, is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her.",
        "Yeah but uh… Okay, okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slept together, but there’s something else. (Pause) Rachel’s pregnant.",
        "With my child.",
        "You already know don’t you?",
        "Okay. Okay. I mean I’ll be okay. It’s just I don’t think I handled it very well.",
        "Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. And then when I turned around she was gone.",
        "But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.",
        "I gotta go find her.",
        "Evidently they do.",
        "Hi!",
        "Uh we-we need to talk.",
        "Please, please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today.",
        "What? Oh yeah. (He moves next to her head.) I’m sorry. I mean I-I think I went a little crazy. I mean I was thinking about myself when I (Wanders towards Rachel’s feet) really—I should have been thinking about you Rach…",
        "Right! Right! I just—I want you to know that I’m going to be there through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctor’s appointments, the uh, the Lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment—Although we could probably worry about that ‘til after we get married.",
        "Well yeah, I think we should get married.",
        "No, because that’s the right thing to do.",
        "No but…but still you can’t possibly do this alone.",
        "Come on Rach, you can’t even eat alone in a restaurant.",
        "I’m just saying if you can’t eat by yourself, how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?",
        "When have you ever?",
        "Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!",
        "I grew up with Monica! If you didn’t eat fast you didn’t eat!!",
        "But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone.",
        "(To Rachel, standing by her feet) I don’t know why you can’t admit that you need me.",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Pretty amazing huh?",
        "What? What?!",
        "You-you just said that you did!",
        "Oh sure, come here! (Sits her up) Sure you can! Uh, look come here look, (rolls the machine closer) it’s-it’s-it’s, it’s right there (Points).",
        "Do you really?",
        "Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this? (Points) This tiny thing that looks like a peanut?",
        "Sweetie that’s it.",
        "You’re welcome.",
        "Yeah, that’s our baby.",
        "Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus.",
        "Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.",
        "(running up) Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long.",
        "Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yeah!!",
        "I’m telling you, I like the food!",
        "Did that guy just call you Toby?",
        "Well, why don’t you correct him?",
        "Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!",
        "(laughs) Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel? (Ross realizes something.) Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? It’s not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!!",
        "Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?",
        "(entering with a pizza and beer) Hey!",
        "So, what do you want to do tonight? There’s a Ukrainian film at the Angelica that’s supposed to be very powerful. Interested?",
        "Rach? You wanna come?",
        "A date?",
        "Why no, it’s the opposite of weird. It’s-it’s uh, regular. It’s-it’s uh, it’s mundane. It’s actually uh, a little dull.",
        "A date?! She’s-she’s got a date?! With who?",
        "You set her up?!",
        "Joey what-what were you thinking?!",
        "Joey, I’m not worried about her! I’m worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this (makes the quote-marks sign) actor taking them?",
        "A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!",
        "Why don’t they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that’s a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That’s fun too! Whew!!",
        "Hi. I-I hear you’re going on a ferry tonight.",
        "A bit of a daredevil are we?",
        "Okay. Have a great time you guys.",
        "Yes it is too slutty! (Joey slams the door before Rachel could hear the entire sentence.)",
        "Books?",
        "Well, I tell you what. Why don’t we uh, why don’t we just stay here? Let’s not see a movie, we’ll just hang.",
        "Hey, if that’s what you want to do I’m not gonna say no.",
        "I just…I have to find out how it went.",
        "This guy could be my baby’s stepfather!",
        "I just—I-I can’t believe she’s-she’s dating?!",
        "I don’t know! I guess I just can’t believe any of this is happening.",
        "It’s just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan’s, it’s like—It breaks my heart a little. I mean I’ve always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y’know? Maybe fight over the science section.",
        "No! No I can’t. I mean Rachel’s out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.",
        "It used to be. Now she doesn’t really have a face. Smokin’ body though.",
        "No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?",
        "No, it’s not what I want either. I mean I-I can’t force myself to fall in love with her again now.",
        "Yeah.",
        "(checks his watch) We can still catch that Ukrainian film.",
        "Hello.",
        "Well, how was the date?",
        "Uh-huh. What happened?",
        "Ah, he didn’t uh, take it so well?",
        "Oh?",
        "He sounds swell.",
        "Hey, wanna…wanna a little cheering up?",
        "Sit down.",
        "Guess whose middle name is Muriel.",
        "Yeah-ha!",
        "I’m sorry about your date.",
        "Yeah I know. (Pause) On the other hand in um, in about seven months you’re gonna have something that you’re gonna love more than any guy you’ve ever gone out with. Just wait. Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger. You have no idea.",
        "You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?",
        "Hey, I thought I cheered you up.",
        "Right. Good night.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Oh hi!",
        "Wow! Uh…how are you?",
        "Oh that’s right. Well uh, would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?",
        "Great! Well umm…",
        "Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya.",
        "Oh thanks. Although it kinda seemed like you were falling asleep there a little.",
        "Yeah, a lot of my students do that.",
        "Okay, I-I’ll see you tonight.",
        "Okay, bye.",
        "Ah, it’s good. It’s going good. I mean, we get along great. She’s, she’s so…",
        "Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!",
        "Well I…I haven’t actually told her yet. I don’t want to scare her off, y’know?",
        "Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance! (Joey nods his agreement.)",
        "Uh actually, sorry I can’t even make it. I’m seeing Mona again tonight.",
        "Uh that’s an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.",
        "So much more.",
        "Aw forget it, it’s from Pier One. (There’s an angry knock on the door.) Sorry. (Goes and opens the door to an irate Dr. Green.)",
        "Y’know this is actually not a great time for me.",
        "Who did?!",
        "Yes. Yes, yes I did. (To Mona) But-but it was, it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing.",
        "No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care—I-I love Rachel.",
        "(to Mona) Oh but not that way. I mean…I mean I’m not in love with her. I love her like a, like a friend.",
        "(to Dr. Green) Hey! I offered to marry her!",
        "(To Mona) But I didn’t want to.",
        "I’m sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.",
        "I was going to tell you, but…",
        "Hey! I did not dump Rachel! (To Mona) Nor are we still together. (The phone rings and Ross goes to answer it, only he’s trapped behind the apothecary table by Dr. Green.) Can I just… (Dr. Green glares at him.) Why don’t we just let the machine get that?",
        "No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I—I need to, I need to lie down.",
        "So your dad dropped by. He’s a pleasant man!",
        "I don’t care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she’s totally freaked out!",
        "Rachel!",
        "Okay!",
        "Thank you!",
        "Thank you so much for coming back over.",
        "Focus.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Trying to date this woman.",
        "Probably shouldn’t touch me.",
        "Should I leave this open for you too?",
        "Because what’s going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel about you.",
        "I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachel’s father. Look I…I made a mistake, but it’s only because I really, really like you. Really!",
        "What?",
        "Well, I’ll-I’ll be there. I mean I have to wear a costume to all my classes that day anyway so…",
        "(exhales sarcastically) Not two years in a row.",
        "Yeah. Yeah, I think I will.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That’s right! He was hitting on her, and I got her. I guess the better man won. (To Joey) Please don’t take her from me.",
        "(entering) Hey! (He’s wearing a costume as well.)",
        "Remember the Russian satellite, Sputnik? (They all look at him.) Well, I’m a potato or a…spud. And these are my antennae. (Points to the colander with an old TV antenna glued on top that he’s wearing.) So Sputnik, becomes… (They’re still confused) Spud-nik. Spudnik!",
        "No, I-I’m not doody.",
        "Hey!",
        "You made it!",
        "Well, I’m a spud…",
        "Yes!",
        "That’s funny. Yeah. Y’know you’re the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.",
        "Uh, in her defense, she’s right. I am stronger. I would destroy you.",
        "Oh I’ll prove it! I’ll prove it like a theorem!!",
        "Oh yeah? You’re going further down! Downtown!",
        "Pride.",
        "(To Chandler) So, you gettin’ tired?",
        "Yeah? Me too. (Pause) Gettin’ a little tired though.",
        "Look this is starting to look really bad for me. Okay? Mona, Mona’s standing right over there. (Looks behind him.) Oh God, she’s talking to Joey! You gotta let me win!",
        "Hey, at least you have a wife! I-I keep getting divorces and knockin’ people up! And I’m dressed as doody.",
        "Come on, who are we kidding? I’m doody. Please? She’s watchin’.",
        "(celebrating) Oh yeah!",
        "Yeah?",
        "Oh. Yeah. (Sarcastically) Uh Chandler let me win. No, Chandler’s really strong. Oh my arm is so sore. Oh nurse! (Waddles over to Mona.)",
        "I think it’s coming from your bag.",
        "So apparently I’m available for lunch.",
        "You’re moving?",
        "So does-does Joey know you’re moving?",
        "That’s not really p0rn.",
        "Hey, y’know what and if you’re looking for a place? I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.",
        "Well I don’t know, but how-how great would that be huh? You living in my building. I could help take care of the baby. I can come over whenever I want. (Rachel looks at him.) With your permission.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah. No. No you’re right.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hi. I’m Ross Geller. I live in the building.",
        "I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I’m so sorry for your loss.",
        "What?",
        "Oh, thank God!",
        "Of course! Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in (Rachel pokes her head in and starts to look around) the laundry room. (Pushes Rachel out of the way.)",
        "Y’know I would it’s just painful.",
        "Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter. (He translates that phrase into Dutch.)",
        "Yeah, we’re done.",
        "Ezel? Ezel? Ezel? (Looks it up in his book.)",
        "Really?!",
        "Sweet!",
        "Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.",
        "No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.",
        "It’s not for me, it’s for Rachel.",
        "Yeah, but when the baby comes she’s gonna want to move.",
        "Yeah, you didn’t expect her to live there with a baby did you?",
        "(finds the word in the book) Ezel! (Reads the translation.) Hey Gunther! You’re an ezel!",
        "Damnit!",
        "Hi. How is she?",
        "(happily) Oh. (Realizes then sadly) Oh. Well I uh, I brought her some bloemen. (Flowers in Dutch.)",
        "Oh I don’t know that it would.",
        "All right then. (Follows her in and checks the place out.)",
        "Well, the old lady died. And how do I know? Her dying wish was for one last kiss. But I don’t care, (To Rachel) because you got the apartment. Yes!",
        "(stutters looking for words) Ezels!!",
        "That’s right, I love you! And-and I’m gonna play with you all the time.",
        "Bye.",
        "Yeah. Why?",
        "Yeah I know; he’s in Ben’s class.",
        "Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils? (Joey is about to sit down and hears this so instead he groans and exits.)",
        "What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?",
        "Uh, I actually haven’t even met him.",
        "Well actually, I’m picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he’ll be there.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school…",
        "I dropped him off at Carol’s. (To Phoebe) Anyway, it turns out that I’m not going to be able to get those tickets though.",
        "Well it turns out that Ben and Sting’s son do not get along.",
        "Apparently, Sting’s son made fun of the fact that Ben’s moms are lesbinims.",
        "Phoebe, you can’t force kids to be friends.",
        "Playpen?! Ben’s seven!",
        "Look I’m sorry Pheebs, I can’t do it.",
        "What?",
        "Look Phoebe, I’m sorry it’s just…",
        "Phoebe, I…",
        "You’re gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!! (Holds up two.)",
        "Well…let’s just say… (singing) Rosss caaaaan!",
        "Uh, middle balcony.",
        "Yeah.",
        "(entering) Will!",
        "Hey-hey you came! Man you look incredible! Hot stuff! (They hug and Ross realizes what he said.) Hot stuff?",
        "Yeah, you too. Man, so-so what are you up to?",
        "Really? Yeah that-that sounds interesting.",
        "Oh! Man I don’t think I’ve seen you since uh, Lance Davis’ graduation party.",
        "Yeah. It would’ve been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun.",
        "Yeah.",
        "(laughs) Yeah.",
        "So how long are you in town?",
        "Aw—oh, that’s right. Are-are you gonna be okay?",
        "Will, high school was-was a long time ago.",
        "Look at her standing there with those yams! My two greatest enemies Ross: Rachel Green and complex carbohydrates.",
        "No need to point, she knows who Ross is.",
        "No. No.",
        "Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but I-I don’t think he-he knew what it was.",
        "That was in high school! It’s not like it was binding forever.",
        "Look Rach I-I’m sorry, okay? I…I was a stupid kid, okay? The only reason I joined…",
        "…co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love with you. Obviously I didn’t handle it very well. But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.",
        "No-no! No-no. No-no.",
        "It was no big deal. We-we…said that the rumor was…that umm…you had both…male and female reproductive parts.",
        "Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that one’s not really our fault.",
        "Rach, I think you’re reading a little too much into it.",
        "Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasn’t true?!",
        "Well look-look I’m not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million years ago!",
        "What?",
        "(shocked) (To Rachel) How did you know that?!!!!",
        "No.",
        "Hey! She didn’t look 50!",
        "She didn’t photograph well!",
        "I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of us. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must know, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace…",
        "Only when it was damp!! (To Rachel) I can’t believe you-you told people about this?! Everybody knew?! Y’know what? (To Will) I’m back in the club!",
        "As a romancer of the elderly.",
        "The eyes…did still sparkle.",
        "Yeah. I mean we are having a baby together.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Nope.",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?",
        "Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?",
        "Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card y’know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.",
        "(pause) Together? Like-like to people?",
        "Okay. (Not happy about it.)",
        "Uh sure, sure.",
        "I know. Can you believe that?",
        "Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!",
        "Hey!",
        "Huh. Wow, this is great.",
        "Well, we-we haven’t said that to each other yet, but I guess its okay to say it to other people.",
        "A hundred?! Well, I-I guess I’ll take a—Mona, uh…I-I’m not sure about the whole uh, card thing.",
        "Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just don’t know if we’re really quite there yet.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Huh.",
        "Hmm…",
        "Let’s do the card!",
        "The card! I think we’re there!",
        "Really?! I mean, even with the card?",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Oh yeah, yeah we’re moving forward. You’ll be getting our card!",
        "Yeah, we’re not just doing a card! Y’know, she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going.",
        "I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, \"So, where is this going?\"",
        "Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I’m not a mind reader! Besides, I hate those conversations. I’m horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a gesture. Y’know, something that says we’re moving forward without having to talk about it.",
        "Smaller than that.",
        "Uh, bigger than that.",
        "Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.",
        "Yeah I-I don’t-I don’t think I’m quite there yet, but I could say I looove spending time with you.",
        "Forget it. I-I—Y’know what? I’ll just have the conversation. I’ll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best. What do you think Rach?",
        "Here we go. Mona umm, I think it’s time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.",
        "Aw, we-we are so…(Motions that they’re connected.) So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y’know hanging out with you. And I mean-I’m having a lot of fun. (He pauses and thinks there might be more, but decides there isn’t.)",
        "I mean, there’s no point in spending time with someone if-if it’s just fun. It’s gotta be, it’s gotta be going somewhere right? So where-where is it going? (Pause) Ah! That’s-that’s the real question. And-and the answer is…is it’s going somewhere…fun. Now I-I know what you’re thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y’know, but you’re-you’re not getting any younger. No I mean—No not you, not you, you—you are getting younger. I mean—you-you look like you’re getting younger by the second—What’s your secret?",
        "Well, well to sum up, we’re having fun, you look young.",
        "But that’s not enough. So… So…here’s a key to my apartment. (Hands her his key.)",
        "Really.",
        "Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship.",
        "Oh great, I live on the street.",
        "Okay, and oh I’m gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give them away for no reason at all.",
        "No. That guy is.",
        "I’m trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.",
        "I love you!",
        "Hey! Oh, I’m so glad you guys are here. I’ve been dying to tell someone what happened in the Paleontology department today.",
        "Professor Neuman, the head of the department, so….",
        "No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes! (Pause) Why didn’t I get head of the department? (Goes and gets some coffee.)",
        "…which brings us back, of course, to Greely’s theory of dominance. (The bell rings.) Okay, that-that’s all for today. Oh, uh does anyone know where the Freeman building is?",
        "What?! That-that’s all the way cross town, I’m supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.",
        "Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! I’m the teacher!!",
        "Hello. (He throws his jacket towards the coat rack and misses.) I’m sorry I’m a little late. Ah—(Checks his watch)—Whoa! A lot late. Let me start by uh, by introducing myself, I am Professor Geller. (The bell rings.) So to sum up, I’m Professor Geller. Good job today.",
        "No, I ran. It was really far, and when did people stop understanding the phrase, \"Get the hell out of my way!\"",
        "Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets it’ll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I? Rockefeller?",
        "Well I have to. Okay? If I don’t, they’ll take the class away from me. And…I already put it in my family newsletter.",
        "You’ve seen it, the Geller Yeller.",
        "Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, I’m sure I can make it this time. I just…I just can’t be afraid to get a little bit…hit by cars. (He goes to the bathroom as Joey enters.)",
        "Yeah!!!! Yes, I made it! I’m on time! (Grabs a bottle of water from a student, takes a drink, and splashes some on his face like the marathon runners do.) Okay, why don’t we all uh, (Exhales loudly) open our books to page 23. Where… (Exhales again) Where you will see…a uh…a bunch of uh…red spots. Okay, (Closes his book.) umm, why don’t, why don’t you all start to read, while I—(Passes out and collapses.)",
        "Phoebe!!",
        "So is everybody here? I got here a little early myself. Let us begin. Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations. (He moves to the map and we see why he made it to class on time, he’s wearing in-line skates and hasn’t taken them off.) Here. (Points to the map, somewhere in the Middle East, then spins on the skates and points to the map.) Here. (China.) Now as for the hydrosaurs…",
        "Right.",
        "No-no, we talked about it. We don’t want to know. All we care about is that it’s happy and healthy.",
        "And smart!",
        "With an aptitude for science.",
        "Really? Me too!",
        "Maybe. But it wouldn’t hurt to have a backup, you know? Uh, Rach-Rach, what were you thinking? (Gives her a look)",
        "Huh. That’s a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.",
        "Well, OK, it’s for a boy. Well, I know it’s a little out there, but…Darwin.",
        "You’re just saying that 'cause I said no to your name!",
        "All right.",
        "That sounds fair.",
        "Veto.",
        "Rain? Hi. Hi, my name is Rain. I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat.",
        "Okay, how about, for a guy, Thatcher?",
        "Fine, you go.",
        "Huh.",
        "Oh, veto. How about—Ooh, I like Ruth! What about Ruth?",
        "Veto. Stewart?",
        "Veto. Helen?",
        "I don’t think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that?",
        "Uh, no. No, we’re not.",
        "No, no, we want to wait, right?",
        "What? Rach! Come on, that’s terrible! They’re…uh…they’re babies. They’re-they’re all beautiful.",
        "Yeah, why is it staring at me? I think it knows I’m talking about it. (Rachel starts to peek at the file) Don’t-don’t you—Wh—Wha—Hey!!",
        "You’re looking!",
        "I saw you!",
        "Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!",
        "No, no, no, no! Don’t tell me! I don’t want to know!",
        "Momentary lapse. Don’t-don’t you have any self-control?",
        "Hey.",
        "Rach, I-I can’t tell you how-how much that means to me! Ohh… Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind? Unless, you know we’re never going to have to use it. You did see the folder. You know it’s a boy!",
        "I don’t think so! You’re just giving me Ruth so you’ll get to name it when it’s a boy, and that’s when you’ll swoop in and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.",
        "Veto.",
        "Unless… (Rachel groans.) You anticipated that I would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named Ruth! Well, I’m not falling for that! Okay? Ruth is off the table!",
        "Not like this!",
        "So, I uh… I called the doctor and now we both know the s*x of the baby.",
        "That’s right. The student has become the master.",
        "Oh, come on, you know it’s a girl!",
        "You really didn’t know?",
        "No.",
        "No.",
        "Yes. I’m… I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.",
        "I know! I know. You know what? I’m putting Ruth back on the table!",
        "Permission to veto.",
        "(from outside the bathroom) Hello?",
        "(entering) Well hey! What’s going on? Ooh, cool boat—(Sees why the boat’s there)—Oh, no. (Averts his eyes by looking around the room) (To Rachel) Hey, did you, did you tell them?",
        "(crying) I hope you’re a better father than you’re a friend!! (Cries again and Joey wakes up in horror.)",
        "Hey!",
        "What?! It is?! (He tries to quickly remove his gloves, but runs into trouble and finally throws them off of his hands like a hockey player in a fight and grabs Rachel’s belly.)",
        "Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?",
        "My God, the baby’s kicking. That’s great. Although I…kinda wish I-I would’ve been there to feel the kicking for the first time y’know.",
        "Look, I-I don’t want to miss anymore baby stuff. So…Here. Here’s my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! I’ll be there! Okay? I don’t care if it’s three in the morning and all you want is ice cream.",
        "(rushes in) Is everything okay?",
        "Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?",
        "Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women don’t even feel them.",
        "Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater.",
        "No I—Mona!",
        "What? Why? What’s wrong?",
        "No really, you tell me what’s up.",
        "(To Joey) So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.",
        "Yeah but still, I mean it should’ve been me. I’m the dad.",
        "Hey uh, I brought you some lunch.",
        "Well yeah!",
        "What?! What?! Rach what?!",
        "I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.",
        "(to Rachel) I-I’m sorry Rach, I didn’t know. Are you gonna be okay?",
        "I can’t believe this! I shouldn’t be the one making her throw up!",
        "Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I don’t know any of it and I’m the father. I wish I’d be more involved y’know.",
        "Yeah.",
        "No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.",
        "So? Sure! But it-it wouldn’t be anything romantic. And I’m-I’m dating Mona—Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! What is wrong with me?!",
        "No! No it’s not. Joey, this is a smart idea.",
        "Really?",
        "Oh Rach that’s great. That’s great. (They hug and Joey breathes a sigh of relief.)",
        "So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh… is he a good guy?",
        "Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.",
        "Joey, it’s worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.",
        "Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself. (Walks towards the door until…)",
        "(closes the door) Did you um—I’m sorry, did you just say it’s Rachel?",
        "Um, you…you like Rachel?",
        "Rachel?!",
        "But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?!",
        "It’s not a big deal? Oh, I’m sorry I just…um, I…what about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I like—you-you can’t stop thinking about her. Like how you can’t sleep?",
        "Rachel who’s carrying my baby? Rachel?",
        "Y’know what? I-I gotta go. (Starts to leave.)",
        "(stops) I just—y’know—I-I just have one—Rachel?!",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh y’know, I still—I can’t believe it. Joey and Rachel I mean it’s… It’s like you and me going out, only weirder!",
        "Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he’d be the stepfather of my child.",
        "Sure, because women never like Joey. Y’know, I think he’s a virgin.",
        "He’s not?",
        "Why?",
        "Hate him? I… No, I don’t hate him. (Pause) It’s just it’s Rachel, y’know?",
        "Okay. Okay, I’ll talk to him.",
        "Hey.",
        "No, I don’t want to hit you.",
        "No.",
        "No, no I don’t want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that I’m not mad at you and…and that I certainly do not hate you. I just, I just came here to say that. (Starts to leave.)",
        "Uh…yeah sure. (Enters.)",
        "Okay.",
        "Thank you.",
        "What?! You’re in love with her.",
        "Umm, no.",
        "I think you need to tell her how you feel.",
        "No, I’m serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if she’s not where you are, then you can start to move past this.",
        "If she is where you are then uh…then my feeling weird about it shouldn’t stand in the way.",
        "Yeah. Look if-if she’s gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn’t find a better guy. So…",
        "So when do you think you’re gonna talk to her?",
        "I’m understanding, but let’s not get carried away.",
        "Yeah, tell me about it. (He stands up, turns his back to Joey, and enjoys another sip.)",
        "(entering) Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? It’s a button down, like a, like a faded salmon?",
        "Faded salmon color.",
        "Great! Great. Then I must’ve left it at Mona’s. I knew it!",
        "That’s my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!",
        "I don’t know. I mean I-I guess I could. It’s just that we didn’t really end things such good terms. And if I go over there I’d be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die. (Walks away.)",
        "Mona? (There’s no answer, so he starts to leave but remembers where her extra key is. He reaches atop a hall light just outside her door and grabs the key. He looks at in triumph as the pain from it being hot moves along his nervous system to his brain, and when it arrives his brain orders his hand to drop the hot key and his mouth to squeal in pain. After dropping the key he pulls his shirtsleeve over his hand and uses the key to open the door and enter Mona’s apartment.) Okay, if I were a salmon shirt, where would I be? (He hears a key in the door and as it opens he dives behind the couch.)",
        "Hello!!",
        "Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.",
        "(on phone) Item J437-A, color: winterberry. (There’s a knock on the door as he hangs up the phone. He answers it to Mona.) Hi umm, listen come here, come in. (She does so.) I’m so-so sorry about yesterday. I-I’m really sorry. It’s just that I… (He picks up the pink shirt.)",
        "You do?",
        "(faking starting to cry) Oh God you’re right.",
        "(laughs) No. (Takes the shirt back.)",
        "Oh, I’m actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah, she’s been away all week visiting her parents, but she’ll be cool. I mean, she’s been so supportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says, ‘Fossils are my friends.’",
        "Uh, I’m going to take off.",
        "What is it?",
        "All right. (reading the label) ‘Candy and Cookie?’",
        "Hey, what’s behind your back?",
        "You don’t want my opinion?",
        "Come on, I’m your older brother, ask me!",
        "(quietly) The red one.",
        "Hey! (they hug) So, how was Atlantic City?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Wha—? Oh, come on. You didn’t have to—saltwater taffy?! (Mona laughs) Thanks! This is interesting. You know, most people think this is made with sea water, but it’s actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. That’s not interesting.",
        "I do too! I missed you!",
        "Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking!",
        "Yeah! I know! It was. Oh… the only sad thing is I wasn’t around when it happened for the first time.",
        "Yeah, I’m missing out on all this other stuff, too. So, Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.",
        "What?",
        "(not amused) Huh…uh-huh.",
        "(with his mouth full) Just a second! (he fake laughs, but turns his head and starts to break down)",
        "I don’t know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um, plus, she, uh, she got me taffy!",
        "Ever?!",
        "Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know, I’m going to take her to an amazing Valentine’s dinner. Do all this romantic stuff, and then, just when she thinks I’m the best boyfriend in the world, then I’m going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.",
        "Well, I’m, uh, going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?",
        "Y’know, it’s interesting! Most people think that’s made with seawater, when in fact—",
        "(opening the door to see Mona standing there) Mona? What are—hi! What are you doing here? I’m, um, supposed to pick you up!",
        "(he makes some really weird noise hear that sounds kind of like…)Ayyyayyyy!",
        "I have no idea!",
        "Uh…lately, she just likes hanging out here.",
        "I think she’s lonely.",
        "I know.",
        "No, no. She’s way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy.",
        "Mm-hmm. She’s—she’s emotional, but, but ballsy.",
        "And you thought she was going to be in our way! So, why don’t you, uh, open the champagne, and I’ll be right back. I’ve got a surprise for you.",
        "(fakes a laugh) Please start drinking! (exits)",
        "(handing Mona the present) Happy Valentine’s Day! …Or something to remember me by.",
        "Hey, hey, man!",
        "Uh…Mona just dumped me.",
        "Well, with everything that’s been going on lately, I haven’t exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didn’t tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?",
        "Yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentine’s Day? What’s going on, huh? Girl trouble?",
        "Really?!",
        "Oh, sorry. Well, look, maybe I can help you with it.",
        "Hey, whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me. Y’know, actually once—once I got dumped during s*x.",
        "Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?",
        "C’mon! Joey! What is it?",
        "Hey, hey, it’s me. Why can’t you tell me?",
        "She’s not a Tribbiani?",
        "I knew it. So, is she someone from work?",
        "Well, uh, does she like you?",
        "Why not?",
        "So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh… is he still in love with her?",
        "Okay. Um… is he a good guy?",
        "Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.",
        "Joey, it’s worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.",
        "Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.",
        "I’m going to…uh…I’m going to, um, put the bourbon in it at home.",
        "Anyway… seriously, uh…just…just talk to the guy, okay? And tell me how it goes. (walks towards the door until…)",
        "Sure. Yeah.",
        "Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?",
        "Okay, hopefully this time mom won’t boo you.",
        "Hey!",
        "Aww that is so cool.",
        "(picking up Chi-Chi’s picture) Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog! Y’know Monica couldn’t get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.",
        "You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!",
        "Ah, actually, I’m sorry we-we probably should get going.",
        "Well, there is an Arby’s in the shape of a tee-pee.",
        "So uh, he seems like a nice guy.",
        "Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?",
        "Hi! (Kisses his mom.) Hey mom.",
        "That’s a good question, dad. That’s a good question…",
        "Wha—What?",
        "Dad so what we have to pretend that we’re married?",
        "Can you believe that?",
        "No, us having to lie about being married.",
        "Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan",
        "We love marriage!",
        "Hey",
        "I’m so we weren’t in the car! Did he ever let up?",
        "(imitating Parker) This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I must take a mental picture! (He backs into someone.) Ooh sorry…(He looks behind him then notices its Phoebe then stops his impression.)",
        "That depends, how much did you hear?",
        "What was wrong with Mona?",
        "Yeah baby!",
        "No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.",
        "Would you excuse us for a second? (Pulls Rachel off to the side) Umm…. what are you doing?",
        "Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley.",
        "Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium. That’s-that’s where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower…",
        "Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words \"Will you marry me?\"",
        "Oh, no, Mom, it’s just Monica this year.",
        "No, of course, Um… Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to say…on behalf of my new bride, Rachel (She turns around and smiles), and myself. Umm, that if…if in 35 years, we’re half as happy as you guys are, we’ll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.",
        "…and then, we could’ve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!",
        "But having a dove place the ring on your finger would’ve been no problem?",
        "Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I’ve ever made.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I know, I know it was stupid.",
        "No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. It’s how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.",
        "It’s a good thing I didn’t do it, because it sounds like it would’ve been a very expensive wedding. (Rachel laughs) Okay, good night",
        "Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn’t get messed up?",
        "That’s all I’m askin’",
        "Y’know I don’t understand why they didn’t cry. It was a beautiful speech.",
        "Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin. And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really would’ve wanted to be there. And you know what? I think she was.",
        "Hey!",
        "Why’d you say no?",
        "Just then or-or all the time, ‘cause we-we have jobs y’know.",
        "Shhh! We’re not talking.",
        "Uh, double latte, extra foam.",
        "(popping up behind Joey wearing an Indian headdress) Come on, it's fun!",
        "Are you serious?!",
        "Wow! We are pretty good at this!",
        "Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!",
        "It tastes like feet!",
        "Are you kidding?",
        "(leaning into the recorder as well) Who just lost the respect of her unborn child.",
        "Yeah, so far nothing stupid.",
        "Uh no, no just-just that he is a great guy.",
        "Yeah, you too.",
        "All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and damnit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes (kisses Joey).",
        "Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... (Stops suddenly and turns to look at Monica) Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!",
        "Your make-up!",
        "Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we’re face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face.",
        "I would say that.",
        "Okay, here I go.",
        "I prefer not to answer that right now, I’m still carrying a little holiday weight.",
        "It really was.",
        "Hi Jill.",
        "Amazing! Amazing!",
        "Wow! This picture of you sure is steamy.",
        "Did you just wink at me?",
        "Hey you guys I got some bad news. (He sets the stack of papers down on the table.)",
        "No, Monica’s restaurant got a horrible review in the Post. (They all gasp.) I didn’t want her to see it, so I ran around the neighborhood and bought all the copies I could find. (He hands the paper to Phoebe and they all read it.)",
        "Umm…",
        "But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.",
        "Yeah, they all know.",
        "(startling him) What?! What?",
        "Are ya?",
        "What are you doing up?",
        "Okay look, I had a lot of water before I went to bed. Can we do this after…",
        "It’s funny you should mention diapers.",
        "Okay look, there’s nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time. There’s a great baby furniture store on west 10th. Tomorrow, we will go there and we will get you everything that you need. Okay?",
        "(interrupting her) Okay. Okay. If uh, if you’re gonna do this, then I’m gonna do that. (Points to the bathroom.) So… (Starts for the bathroom.)",
        "(annoyed) Yeah!",
        "(stunned) (thinks) Well uh…",
        "Oh.",
        "We are having a baby together, but we’re not involved. (The cashier, a very beautiful woman, looks confused) I mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a while ago, but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night. (Rachel looks at him angrily) Or, yes stranger, we’d like this delivered please.",
        "Oh, okay.",
        "I chose those, I’m a paleontologist.",
        "Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.",
        "That’s my gym.",
        "I am like Indiana Jones.",
        "My son? Pretty serious. (There’s a knock on the door and Ross answers it.) Oh hey Katie! (The cashier from before) What uh, what are you doing here?",
        "Ah, must’ve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.",
        "Oh. (Reaches into his pocket for some money as Rachel enters the living room and watches holding two stuffed dinosaurs.)",
        "Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. I’m just gonna put this (The money) back in my pocket, pretend that didn’t happen. Uh yeah, actually I’m free now. Do you wanna grab some coffee or…",
        "(To Katie) Yeah, I’m just gonna grab my coat. And uh, and my whip. (Katie looks worried.) Y’know because of the Indiana Jones? (Katie laughs) Not-not because I’m-I’m into S&M. (Katie’s worried again.) I’m not-I’m not into anything weird. Y’know? Just-just normal s*x. (Katie is uncomfortable.) So, I’m gonna grab my coat. (Does so, leaving Katie and Rachel alone.)",
        "Hey.",
        "How are you?",
        "Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee.",
        "What’s uh, what’s going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie?",
        "I liked her.",
        "Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!",
        "Why? What was wrong with her?",
        "Okay, so what’s the matter?",
        "(laughs) Why? What, what are you jealous?",
        "Okay.",
        "I won’t date. I’ll uh, I’ll be here, with you, all the time.",
        "True, but you’re allowed to be unreasonable. You’re having our baby.",
        "Do you feel better?",
        "Uh Rach?",
        "Just one thing umm…",
        "We live together. You’re having our baby. I’m not gonna see anybody else. Are you-are you sure you don’t want something more?",
        "Oh-oh, Rach! I was just messin’ around! (She’s stunned) Like you did last night when I had to pee?",
        "(pause) Okay. Okay. Because for a minute you said you…",
        "…that you actually…",
        "Rach?",
        "The bathroom?",
        "Oh cool!",
        "Well do you want some help?",
        "Awesome!",
        "(simultaneously with Chandler) Yeah!",
        "Well uh, I-I’m a paleontologist. Umm, I-I live in New York. I have a son Ben. Uh, hi Ben! (Waves.) And uh…",
        "I’m sorry, I don’t believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.",
        "The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh, I’ll take another question.",
        "It’s okay, I’m ready.",
        "(exhaling) The fear of Triscuts!",
        "It’s possible, they have really sharp edges.",
        "Wait a minute, I-I believe I’m entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?",
        "Y’know what? You’re just upset because you’re losing.",
        "What?!",
        "(To Chandler) You don’t think it’s a little crazy that you get all my points just ‘cause you…",
        "(excited and simultaneously as Chandler) Hungry monkey! (To Chandler) Haaa! (To Joey) I’d like a Wicked Wango card!",
        "(thinking) Oh. (Pause) Oh! Oh my God! Okay, I know this, give me-give me a second!",
        "Shut up! I Dream of Genie!",
        "I’d like to spin the wheel!",
        "Is there a hopping bonus?",
        "Ben Franklin.",
        "Queen Victoria.",
        "Noooo!!! Every time!!!",
        "Yeah!!",
        "(entering, out of breath) Hey!",
        "I just Bamboozled Chandler! (Flexes in victory while everyone stares at him.) Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.",
        "Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.",
        "(excited) A Play-Dough Barber Shop?",
        "Uh, what?",
        "What—You’re not serious. I mean she’s a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. She’ll drive us totally crazy.",
        "Hi roomie! (Hugs her and looks at Rachel.)",
        "Well we…we don’t have a garage.",
        "Y’know what? Maybe, Mrs. Green, it’s not absolutely vital that you live with us.",
        "I’m-I’m sure that’s not true.",
        "Well uh, y’know what? Even if she doesn’t know anything, I do! I have a son. And his mother and I didn’t live together, and whenever he was with me I took care of him all the time, by myself.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That’s a different issue. Uh, the point is, when the baby comes I will be there to…to feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want to do all those things.",
        "Yes! Yes, you’re gonna be so missed.",
        "Well you’re gonna be a wonderful grandma. (They hug.)",
        "Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way. You’ll—you’re gonna pick it up. (Rachel doesn’t believe that.) Hey! You will! Uh look, y’know when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddy’s credit card. Do you remember?",
        "Look at you! What—You’re-you’re this big executive! You are much more capable than you give yourself credit for. I-I have no doubt you’re gonna be an incredible mother.",
        "I’m telling you.",
        "Oh. (Rachel and he start to stand up.)",
        "You sure?",
        "All right then. (Gets up, in an announcer’s voice) Rachel Green! Let’s play Bamboozled! (Reading from a note card.) How do you test the temperature of the baby’s bath water?",
        "Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?",
        "That’s correct! This is an audio question, what do you do when the baby makes this sound? (Makes a sound like someone is choking a cat.)",
        "Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango card?",
        "Oh, I’m sorry you’ve been Bamboozled! You’re gonna be a terrible mother! (Rachel stares at him agape.) I’ve lost sight of why we’re doing this! (Rachel gets up and walks away.)",
        "Hey! What are you guys looking at?",
        "Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent!",
        "Now I cannot wait to see this.",
        "Uh sweetie, maybe you’d be more comfortable here? (Gets up from the green armchair.)",
        "Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do. I mean I wish I were a seahorse. (She glares at him) Because with seahorses it’s the male, they carry the babies. And then also umm, I’d be far away in the sea. (He sits back down.)",
        "(entering) Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctor’s appointment.",
        "Rach, we gotta go.",
        "People ask me why we’re not together, I just don’t know what to tell them.",
        "Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctor’s keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry…",
        "Really? You don’t think that’s a little inappropriate. (She’s wearing a tank top and has her belly sticking out.)",
        "Fine! Fine! Y’know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You’re the mommy.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Mmm?",
        "Wow!",
        "Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, you’ve been a little short with me lately. I’m not trying to irritate you.",
        "Y’know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don’t we not speak until then.",
        "Y’know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that’s half human and half pure evil!",
        "(to Rachel) Oh, you’re nice to her.",
        "Do them!!",
        "You’ve got to be kidding me!",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.",
        "It’s s*x.",
        "Monica!",
        "Monica, what is the matter with you?",
        "What?! While she’s been going through this hell, you’ve been making money?! You’re betting on your friend staying in this misery?! (Phoebe lowers her head and shakes it yes.)",
        "What?!",
        "Can I get some of that action?",
        "Come on, finish your enchilada.",
        "Okay here, have one of these peppers. Oh ha… Oh God! So…so hot! (Rubs his eyes.) Oh my—(Laughs.) By the way, you don’t want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye.",
        "Stop it.",
        "I’m sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, I’m dying.",
        "This is insane, I’m not gonna make love to you just so that you’ll go into labor.",
        "Always a great way to get in a man’s pants.",
        "I love when you talk dirty to me.",
        "Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen.",
        "Y’know what?",
        "Forget it.",
        "I’m getting that baby out of you!",
        "Oh, I know.",
        "I am good. Okay! Okay! Uh, I got the pillow! I got the bag! You got the keys?",
        "Hey!",
        "We’re having a baby.",
        "Not so much.",
        "Hey Joey. (To Rachel) Hey you.",
        "You’re weird today. (He turns to Rachel and Joey puts the ring back.) (To Rachel) Listen I uh, wanted to talk to you about something.",
        "Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?",
        "What?",
        "Hey, where’s uh, where’s mom?",
        "Uh Dad, Emma’s in the nursery. I’ll take you now. If you want, but (To Rachel) I really want to talk to you.",
        "What about Ben?",
        "Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room.",
        "Yeah right.",
        "What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?",
        "Dad seriously! Y’know you really should see someone about that!",
        "I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?",
        "(noticing something) Actually umm… (He turns Mr. Geller’s head to look at Emma.)",
        "Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I’ll guess just…I’ll come back. (Ross exits followed by Joey.)",
        "Dad, what are you doing?",
        "No!",
        "Y’know what? I don’t like you without mom. (To Joey) Come on. (Walks away.)",
        "Hi!",
        "What, that we had a baby? Come on let’s give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.",
        "What?",
        "Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn’t propose.",
        "(pause) I am a doctor! Y’know what? I’m just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.",
        "No! No, come on let her sleep! She’s so exhausted.",
        "What? (Motions for Phoebe to go outside with him.) Oh my God! She-she thinks we’re engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we’re engaged?!",
        "I didn’t give her that ring!",
        "No!",
        "It’s mine.",
        "Yes!",
        "No!",
        "No!!",
        "Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybe…kinda…wanted ah…start…things up again.",
        "Look, I didn’t want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didn’t want to either. But I don’t, I don’t understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?",
        "Well I didn’t! I didn’t propose! (Pause) Unless uh… (Pause) Did I? I haven’t slept in forty hours and…it does sound like something I would do.",
        "Hey.",
        "Listen, I um… I heard about the engagement.",
        "And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I um…I didn’t propose to you.",
        "I don’t think you do.",
        "Poor baby, you’re so tired. Rach, I didn’t propose to you, Joey didn’t propose to you, and Chandler didn’t propose to you.",
        "Joey proposed to you?",
        "Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?",
        "Wait! Whoa-whoa, you…you gave her the ring?",
        "Whoa! You were down on one knee?",
        "Then what did happen?",
        "Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!",
        "What?!",
        "Uhh… No.",
        "But I-I was going to see if y’know, maybe you uh, start dating again but that—I mean that-that was all, Rach.",
        "No, you didn’t!",
        "(To Joey) I can’t believe you told her I was going to propose!",
        "Hey, I’m not going to rush into anything!",
        "What?",
        "Thank you. (The nurse exits.)",
        "Good weird?",
        "We’re so lucky.",
        "Look, I-I know it’s not a proposal and I don’t know where you are, but with everything that’s been going on and with Emma and…I’ve been feeling…",
        "Yeah?",
        "Okay, well, that… Wow, okay, well, umm…then maybe, at least we can, we can talk about us again.",
        "Well good, okay. I-I, kind of think y’know if we…if… You’re wearing the ring.",
        "And you told Phoebe you were engaged.",
        "When you thought Joey proposed did…did you say yes?",
        "All right! (Checking his watch) Yes!! From home to the hospital in under seven minutes! We did it!!",
        "No, but come on, we’re off to a great start aren’t we? I knew I’d get you here fast, but this has got to be some kind of a record!",
        "Wait a minute! How-how the hell did you beat us here?",
        "N… No! We took a cab too, but I did test runs!",
        "Okay is there…some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?!",
        "Okay. Okay. (To the nurse behind the desk.) Umm hi, this is Rachel Green. I’m Ross Geller. We-we called from the car.",
        "Yeah?",
        "I really think they’re out of rooms.",
        "Well then we’d be in a lot of trouble, you don’t know where any countries are. (Rachel glares at him.) Okay. (He goes over to the desk followed by Rachel.) Uh, say would you umm… Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have (Handing her some money) opened up?",
        "What-what?",
        "Thank you.",
        "Yeah, guess so. Whew! Check these out! (He’s looking at the stirrups on the other bed in the room and Rachel groans. Ross then hops into the bed and puts his legs into the stirrups.) Never done this before.",
        "Hi! Hi, I’m uh Ross. I’m here to ruin this magical day for you.",
        "Hi Julie.",
        "This is Rachel. (Points at her.)",
        "Yeah.",
        "Umm say, I-I opened this earlier (The privacy screen) but let me give you guys some privacy.",
        "Oh, okay.",
        "What?",
        "Oh. Okay, just breathe.",
        "(simultaneously as Rachel) We’re not gonna do that.",
        "Uh yes! Thank you.",
        "Later.",
        "Oh uh, I’m sorry. (Runs out.)",
        "Hi! I’m so glad you’re here, but it’s gonna be a while. I-I wished you’d called first.",
        "Oh good.",
        "Okay, what’s up?",
        "Ma, you’re asking me to marry you?",
        "Mom no, come on! Thank you.",
        "N-no! Okay? We’ve been through this! We’re not gonna get married just because she’s pregnant, okay?",
        "Mom, y’know what? I-I can’t deal with this right now. I’m sorry…",
        "Gimmie! (Takes the ring and puts it in his coat pocket as Rachel enters the hallway.)",
        "…she came and dragged me out of the labor room to ask me why I’m not with Rachel.",
        "Are you kidding? Look, we’re not gonna be together just because we’re having a baby. Okay?",
        "Okay, stop it! I can’t deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby.",
        "(To Rachel) Hey. Who’s that?",
        "What happened to the Disgustingtons?",
        "Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?",
        "Yeah? Okay.",
        "Umm. Umm, I’m-I’m just gonna—(Closes the privacy screen.)",
        "No-no, I’m…I’m sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy. (He closes the screen and stares wide-eyed at Rachel.)",
        "Just ignore them.",
        "What? What?",
        "(to him) Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!",
        "The nurse said they’re bringing in another woman.",
        "That’s it. That’s it.",
        "Just three?! I’m dilated three!",
        "Actually it’s more like this. (Pushes her hands to less than an inch apart.)",
        "Uh Rach…",
        "And yet somehow it’s true!",
        "(To Rachel) Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby’s ears!",
        "(softly) Really?",
        "Oh there you go!",
        "No-no. We…",
        "Um uh…We’re-we’re just having this baby together but uh, uh that’s all.",
        "Uh well umm…we’re just not in that place, y’know? But we’re very excited about this.",
        "Sid you lucky deaf b*st*rd.",
        "Hey!",
        "Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything.",
        "Y’know what I think it is? I think you’ve made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn’t want to leave.",
        "Sweetie you’re doing great.",
        "What? You do? You do? (Looks) Oh my God!",
        "What is that?",
        "Oh thank God, I thought she had two heads.",
        "Go!",
        "Yes you can!",
        "Hey! Hey! Come on! You can! I know you can do this! Let’s go!",
        "No! Come on let’s—One more time! One final push! Ready? 1…2…3! (Rachel pushes so hard her head snaps up head-butting Ross and knocking him down.)",
        "(from the floor) Keep pushing!",
        "You have no idea how much this hurts. (All of the women in the room turn and glare at him.) Keep going! Keep going!",
        "Oh! Oh! She’s upside down but she’s coming! She’s coming!",
        "Oh! Oh my God oh! Oh my God she’s here.",
        "Oh she’s…she’s perfect.",
        "Oh it’s okay. They’re just-they’re just wrapping her up.",
        "Oh, come in.",
        "The doctor says it’s completely normal with all the hormones. Plus, you-you’re sleep deprived.",
        "Uh actually, we-we’ve narrowed it down to two names.",
        "Wow! Umm, okay uh…everyone…this…is Isabella. (Rachel starts crying.) What?",
        "Umm, Delilah.",
        "So I guess we’re back to uh, Baby Girl.",
        "Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going to be.",
        "(entering) Hey Janice!",
        "Who’s this little guy? (Gasps when he sees Aaron.)",
        "No-no. No.",
        "Okay.",
        "Man! Did you see the kid on that nose?",
        "Huh?",
        "Yeah. Yeah, it really was. But we…we gotta be careful. We…we can’t let that happen again, y’know?",
        "I mean we don’t want to go down that road do we?",
        "Oh my God! I’m sorry, I was talking to this nurse, completely forgot.",
        "Yeah. She’s putting her down now, that’s her. (Points to the nurse putting Emma now.)",
        "Look at Emma!",
        "Oh what are you kidding? She’s gorgeous, it’s all Rachel.",
        "It’s…it’s complicated okay?",
        "Look, we’ve been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby. (Pause) It’s just if-if we got together again and it didn’t work out…I could never do that to Emma. I mean she-she thinking everything—(Starts to cry.) Oh that’s…now me. What do they put something in the water in this place? Since Rachel and I we’re doing really, we’re doing really well right now.",
        "Yeah, exactly.",
        "You said you’d marry Joey?",
        "So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?",
        "So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend.",
        "Well, Chandler’s my oldest friend, but Joey’s my—No! Ah! (points at Rachel)",
        "Rachel said she’d marry you?!",
        "(enters from the bed room) Okay I put most of the stuff away.",
        "In the closet.",
        "Linen closet.",
        "In the hospital.",
        "No I left the diapers at the hospital! There’s some in the bag but I’ll run out and get some more.",
        "Sure what kind?",
        "Please take your time, it’s an important decision. Not like, say, I know! deciding to marry someone, this is about a muffin.",
        "Blueberry it is.",
        "Hey Gunther, can I get a couple of blueberry muffins to go? (He puts a bag with diapers in it on the counter.)",
        "Yep.",
        "Yep, can you believe it?",
        "Huh? Ooh (laughs) you mean like a… Huh?",
        "Ah actually we don’t. (Ross walks off)",
        "(turns back) What! (Angrily) You didn’t do anything wrong?!",
        "Okay let’s put aside that you (Makes quote marks with his fingers.) \"accidentally\" picked up my grandmothers ring and you (Does it again) \"accidentally\" proposed to Rachel.",
        "And I can even understand that you couldn’t tell Rachel, but why couldn’t you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didn’t.",
        "Not using it right, Joe.",
        "I’m gonna go.",
        "Give me the bag.",
        "Joey!",
        "I’m not gonna hit you.",
        "No I don’t.",
        "No.",
        "No!",
        "Give me the bag.",
        "Give me the bag.",
        "Joey, give me the bag.",
        "Joe I’m not kidding…",
        "No!",
        "You ducked!!",
        "Oh my god, this really hurts!!!",
        "What is the matter with you?!?",
        "Why don’t we talk about this on the way to the hospital?",
        "I broke my thumb.",
        "You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms. (Tries to hold the pen but can’t)",
        "Why, does it look like I’m having trouble with my misshapen claw? (He hands Joey the form)",
        "Just Ross!",
        "You know my birthday.",
        "October 18th.",
        "Actually I’m a palian… Dinosaurs is fine… the drawing is not.",
        "Ah, Rachel I guess.",
        "Just ah… just put roommate.",
        "I don’t think that we are.",
        "Well, I thought so too, but then she said she’d marry you.",
        "Yeah that’s what she said.",
        "So I don’t wanna be just anybody.",
        "You know what, it’s, it’s better this way anyway. I mean I don’t know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. It’s just much easier if we’re just friends who have a kid.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yes. I mean, it’s what we always planned. And if you have a plan, you should stick to it. That’s why they call them plans. Hello? (Pause) I’m fine.",
        "Hey there you go! (Smiles because Joey used it correctly)",
        "Hey.",
        "Ah I had a little thing with Joey, if you think this is bad you should see him.",
        "Okay.",
        "What, Rach?",
        "(smiles) Right.",
        "Well, that’s what I’m here for. (Emma starts crying again) Want me to get that?",
        "sure.",
        "people (shakes head, they sit) so why you all dressed up.",
        "oh yea now um how is that going, is it getting serious?",
        "you know I really admire your whole dating attitude, it's so healthy I'm always like is this moving to fast? Is this moving to slow? Where's this going?",
        "but you, your so much better off you just go from guy to guy having fun and never worrying that it terns into anything serious.",
        "There isn't that's what I'm saying. (All happy)",
        "I know and yet here you are all ready for the next date.",
        "no, no, no there's nothing wrong with you I mean you don't strike me as the type of person that wants to get married anyway.",
        "please don't cry because of me pheebs I don't know what I'm talking about, I've been divorced three times.",
        "I'm sorry I didn't catch.",
        "Oh Ross Geller",
        "do you have a compact in your purse?",
        "you look great.",
        "so how'd the date go?",
        "So he hasn't called?",
        "now I feel terrible this is all my fault.",
        "We are a rare breed.",
        "(He knocks at the door, Mike opens it) Hey Mike sorry to just drop by like this, can I come in?",
        "I'm Ross, Phoebe's friend from the coffeehouse.",
        "yeah I really, really need to talk to you about something.",

        "Damn super cuts!",
        "oh no yeah, no Phoebe is great, but umm I'm an idiot look right before you guys went out I accidentally got her all upset.",
        "yes, yeah I said something stupid about her never having had a serious relationship, but you should know she is so much fun, a wonderful person please don't blow her off.",
        "well then I didn't need to bother you or the four other Mike Hanagens I bothered.",
        "of course she has. if she'd never had a serious relationship I'd go round broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron.",
        "yes, yes I did. and I will also say what I'm about to say Vis-�-vis the following Phoebe has never had a serious relationship since her. super-serious relationship with. Vicrum.",
        "WHAT THAT'S A REAL NAME!",
        "Hey!",
        "YAY! (He continues the happiness with her by dancing around) quick thing, I went to talk to Mike.",
        "oh boy you got mad at that part. I went over there to tell him how great you are but you know me BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, and I ended up telling him that.",
        "umm. that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named Vicrum.",
        "well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in a serious relationship.",
        "well Phoebe, I think you'll feel better when you know a little bit about Vicrum, His a Kite designer (He makes a wow face) and he used to date Oprah. (He makes another wow face)",
        "Good yeah just be honest with him.",
        "I'll get it",
        "(They kiss and the phone rings and machine picks it up, its Ross putting on an accent pretending to be Vicrum) This is Vicrum.",
        "(Ross and Rachel enter)\nHi!\nRoss: Hey! So what's the big news you had us rush all the way over here for?\nChandler: Okay, our news. My company has asked me to head up our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated.\nRoss: Oh my God!\nPhoebe: What?!\nRachel: What?!\nRoss: Monday?!\nJoey: How long do you have to go for?\nChandler: They said it could be up to a year.\nJoey: A year?!\nRachel: (To Monica) Do you have to go?\nMonica: I kind of have to don't I? Because of this stupid thing (Points to her wedding ring.)\nChandler: There is nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh?\nJoey: Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot, but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week.\nChandler: I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it.\nJoey: We were gonna go see the Jets!\nRoss: You can't go, I mean you're the glue that holds this group together!\nChandler: Really?\nRoss: Not you.\nJoey: I can't believe you guys are moving.\nPhoebe: I call their apartment!!!\nEveryone: No!!! Ah!! Ahh!!!",
        "Here you are (Hands Rachel a cup of coffee)\nRachel: Thank you Joey. You know what? I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.\nRoss: I went thru this with Ben and Carol. One cup of coffee won't affect your milk.\nRachel: Yeah. Just to be sure I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.\nJoey: (Laughs)\nRachel: Every time? (She takes up her cell phone and starts dialing.)\nJoey: Uhuh.\nRoss: Rach, you don't have to call whenever you have a little question, okay? Trust me, I know this.\nRachel: All right, I trust you.

Person named Wiener, God that kills me. (Laughs)\nPhoebe: Look at you all grown up.\nJoey: Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship. You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot.\nPhoebe: You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you set me up with someone, and we double date!\nJoey: I can do that, yeah. How is Friday?\nPhoebe: Done. Oh good, really?\nJoey: Yeah!\nPhoebe: Let's see! (Opens her address book.) Oh, you know who's great? Sandy Poophack.\nJoey: (Laughs) Poophack...

Okay? I'm not insane!\nRoss: Well, what was it?\nRachel: Hiccups.\nRoss: Rach, I told you, you can't call him every time any little thing comes up.\nRachel: Yeah well, not anymore I can't. He fired us! What are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name?\nRoss: Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a good idea. In fact, I think he's dead.\nRachel: Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!\nRoss: Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well.\nRachel: What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well? What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had that shot.\nRoss: You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like!

        "Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do.\nMonica: You're right. (Pause) Maybe I shouldn't go.\nChandler: What?\nMonica: So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javo (sp?). It's just a little outside of Tulsa.\nChandler: How far outside?\nMonica: Manhattan.\nChandler: And you're thinking of taking it? (Pause) So before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now it's old job, (Raises his hand) me, (Raises his hand) new job.\nMonica: I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.\nChandler: What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?\nMonica: Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.\nChandler: I think you should take the job.\nMonica: Really?\nChandler: Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.\nMonica: That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!\n(Ross and Rachel enter with Emma.)\nRoss: Hey!\nMonica: How was the pediatrician?\nRachel: Oh, I really liked him. (Looks at Ross) Yeah, it was really, really, really good.\nRoss: You promised you wouldn't say anything.\nRachel: I know. (Pause) Ross still sees his pediatrician!!! (To Ross) I don't care!\nMonica: Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?\nRoss: He's a brilliant diagnostician!\nChandler: Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?\nRachel: Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.\nRoss: Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'\nChandler: Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?\nRoss: Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!\nChandler: That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!\nRoss: It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!",
        "Excuse me, I don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby with the rash came in after me.\nReceptionist: The doctor will be right with you sir.\nGirl: (Reading a book) Mommy, I can't find Waldo.\nRoss: With the circus? He's behind the elephant.\nWoman: Wow, so your child is a big fan of the Waldo books too?\nRoss: Yeah, that's how I know. I'm Ross by the way.\nSally: Hi, I'm Sally. So, no ring. Can I assume you are also a single parent?\nRoss: I am a single parent.\nSally: It's hard isn't it? There's almost no time for a social life. I mean, where are you gonna meet someone?\nRoss: Well, let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the pediatrician's office.\nNurse: (To Ross) Rossy, we're ready for you.\nRoss: Hmm, yeah. (To a random boy in the waiting room) Come on Ross jr. It's time to go in.\nBoy: Mommy (He walks over to Sally.)\nGirl: Mommy, what's wrong with that man?\nRoss: Hey, I helped you find Waldo!",
        "(Enters) Oh good, you haven't left yet.\nMonica: Where have you been?\nRoss: I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office. There was some guy that freaked everybody out.\nChandler: Well, you got here just in time. I really have to go buddy.

(They hug)\nChandler: (Tries to hug Joey but J. moves away) What's the matter Joe?\nJoey: I'm mad at you for leaving! You're nothing but a big leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.\nChandler: Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?\nJoey: Dude, you see right thru me!! (They hug) (Joey heads for the door and pushes Chandler's suitcase on the way out.)\nChandler: Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!\nPhoebe: Okay, bye-bye! (Pushes Chandler out the door.) Good trip! (Slams the door)\nMonica: (Runs out to the hallway) Chandler, wait. It goes: Old job, (Raises her hand) new job, (Raises her hand really high) you.

        "So, so, is Mike coming to dinner?",
        "Pheebs, I would make a reservation for five, because one of us has to stay home and watch Emma. (to Ross:) Which one of us should go to dinner?",
        "Actually, um, I was thinking maybe both of us could go.",
        "Thanks, I put a lot of extra thoughts on your gift.",
        "(laughs) Well, don't believe everything you hear, Ken.\n(both turning away to files) But yeah, that's true. Alright, let's\nget started, by take a look at last quarter's figures. (The female\nnext to Chandler starts smoking, towards heRoss:) Ah, Claudia, aren't\nyou supposed to blow smoke up the bosses' ass?",
        "Alright, we'll just, uh, see when you get here. Bye. (hangs up) Huh, that was my mom, she's stuck in terrible traffic.",
        "Oh, what were the other two?",
        "I know, it's the first time, we're leaving the baby and ... hey, I know how hard it is for you, but ... but Emma is gonna be fine. My mom is gonna be with her. She's great with kids.",
        "Ya.",
        "Hey, you only heard Monica's side of that. That little fatso was a terror.",
        "Rachel, I know that you can. And you should.",
        "Really, it would be good for you and in fact, why don't you, why don't you go ahead to the restaurant and I will wait for my mom and then I'll meet you there.",
        "No, no, really. You should go. Just go! Go! Go out! Really, the world is your oyster. Kick up the heels. Paint the town red. (Slang right?)",
        "I'm serious. C'mon, you should go. Here. (shoves her outside, while she tries to stay) No, uh-uh, just go.",
        "No! No, you know what? (closes the door) You [can't get in there] (?), the baby's fine, now scram. Yeah, [I told you a|Tell your] story walking. (?)",
        "Oh, (door is locked) holy moly are we in a pickle now.",
        "Okay, well the ??? is not home.",
        "Oh-oh, wait, my mother is gonna be here any minute. And she has the keys.",
        "I would, but I bruise like a peach. Besides, y...you know, everything is gonna be fine. The baby's sleeping.",
        "Can't hold her own head up, but yeah jumped.",
        "Rach you did not leave the water running. Please, just pull yourself together, okay?",
        "You never cooked since 1996. (Actually Rachel cooked in \"609 - TOW Ross Got High\", first aired 1999-11-25.)",
        "Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think you're right. I think .. listen, listen!",
        "A pigeon, a pigeon. (previously scared Rachel turns away) No,\nno wait, no-no, an eagle flew in. Landed on the stove and caught\nfire. The baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty\nbird's aid. The eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression\nand grabs the baby on its talon. Meanwhile the faucet fills the\napartment with water. Baby and bird still up lays (?) are locked in a\ndeath grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the apartment.",
        "Great. So let's get going?",
        "Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.",
        "I'm so sorry ...",
        "And then Rachel wasn't sure she could leave the baby.",
        "What?",
        "Thanks. Oh.",
        "Y'know this ??? is incredible.",
        "Okay, I'll have the fixed salad and the duck.",
        "Rach, c'mon, Emma is fine. You're turning into an obsessive mother. Okay, you need to stop.",
        "(childish) Huh-huh, they already know it.",
        "W-oa ... Mommy! (gestures to his not understanding mother)",
        "Well, ??? think that's us?",
        "You know, I think that's a good idea--our babysitter just pounded in another Chardonnay. (both get up) Bye, y'guys.",
        "And that's why, no matter what mommy says, we really were on a break.\n(baby talk) Yes we were! Yes we were! (picks Emma up) Come here gorgeous.\n(puts her on his knees and talks to her) Oh! Look at you! You are the cutest\nlittle baby ever! You're just a... a little bitty baby, you know that? But\nyou've got... (in a softer voice) You've got big beautiful eyes... Yes you\ndo... and a... and a big round belly. (emphasises the B's) Big baby butt! I\nlike big butts. (raps) I like big butts and I cannot lie / you other\nbrothers can't deny / when a girl walks in with an itty, bitty, waist / and\na round thing in your face you get...(Emma laughs) Oh my God, Emma... you're\nlaughing! Oh my God, you've never done that before, have you? You never done\nthat before... Daddy made you laugh, huh? Well, daddy and Sir Mix Alot...\nWhat? What? You... you wanna hear some more? Uhm...(raps) My anaconda don't\nwant none / unless you got buns hon... (Emma laughs again and Ross looks\nworried) I'm a terrible father!",
        "Hi.",
        "Guess what? I made Emma laugh today.",
        "Yeah, and it was uhm... it was like a real little person laugh too. It\nwas... it was like uhm... (Ross tries to impersonate Emma's laugh, but it\ncomes out very squeaky, very high pitched. He laughs about himself but then\nlooks at Rachel, realises that it sounded weird and straightens his face.)\nOnly... only not creepy.",
        "I uhm... Well, I sang... (Rachel gasps) well actually I rapped... Baby\nGot Back... (Rachel's face changes from excited to angry)",
        "But you know what, if you think about it, it actually promotes a\nhealthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm... juicy\ndoubles.",
        "Please don't take her away from me!",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh I know, isn't it? Ooh... what'd you do to get her to laugh?",
        "You sang Baby Got Back didn't you?",
        "She sweat, wet. got it going like a turbo 'vette.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Hell yeah!",
        "Shake it!",
        "Shake it!",
        "Baby got back (Then Ross turns around and sees their friends standing\nin the doorway)",
        "Rachel please! That is so inappropriate!",
        "Thank you.",
        "Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.",
        "Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews (They sit down and Rachel sighs) And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with.",
        "She was blonde? (he looks surprised for a while, but then gets a \"gotcha\" expression on his face... There's knocking at the door.) Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three years.",
        "And she's a little mannish...",
        "Are you gay? (Rachel turns to Ross in an embarrassed way)",
        "(skeptic) So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?",
        "(on a yeah, right tone) Okay.",
        "Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap. (In the other room Emma starts to cry.)",
        "Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!",
        "Because, it's weird!",
        "What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's like if a woman wanted to be...",
        "King?",
        "You gotta be at least bi...",
        "(very worried) Is everything allright?",
        "And I'm fine never having heard it... (Rachel looks at Ross in a \"why do you say that\" manner) Rach, can I... can I see you for a sec?",
        "Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in.",
        "(picks up a cookie) Okay, okay, see... that... that is the problem. He is too sensitive. (takes a bite from the cookie)",
        "(speaking with his mouth full) Yeah, I mean, all things that guy... (looks at the cookie) These are amazing!",
        "This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even... butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks. (takes a careful bite from the cookie)",
        "Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.",
        "Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?",
        "Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes Madeleines?",
        "(looks like in heaven) Lighter than air... (changes back to serious) But that's not the point. (Joey now also enters)",
        "Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.",
        "Thank you!",
        "...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?",
        "Wow!",
        "Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?",
        "Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny. (Joey makes a gesture and sound like \"Can you believe that?\")",
        "Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you! (He points at Chandler. Joey gestures to Ross \"What are you doing?)",
        "Yep! That's my thing...",
        "Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.",
        "(looks angrily at Joey and points at him) I swear to God...! (Joey is in shock)",
        "Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets?",
        "(shakes his head) Oh my God!",
        "Oh, I'm sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps for me.",
        "Well, you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can't... I can't go through with this.",
        "No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...",
        "Thank you!",
        "Here goes...",
        "Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. I'm afraid it's not working out.",
        "Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great... with Emma... uhm... We just feel...",
        "I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...",
        "Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings.",
        "No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's uhm... my issue.",
        "You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you.",
        "Why... I... I don't know. (Sandy tilts his head again) Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?",
        "I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now.",
        "I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.",
        "It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says... \"What are you doing with those things? What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like a... like a real boy?",
        "I know I am! (Ross now starts to cry) ...And when it's summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?",
        "Here come some more...",
        "A lot of people are thankful for those.\n< knock on door>",
        "Hey Amy.",
        "That was me.",
        "Sure, we don't live there but...",
        "I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD.",
        "Don't say that.",
        "Sure, you want to go upstairs?",
        "You know, I think thats a great idea. It'll be like the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.",
        "Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.",
        "Hi.",
        "Emma.",
        "Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want Monica and Chandler.",
        "well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma would go to my parents.",
        "Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.",
        "No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you're strongest when.. when you're together.",
        "Sure, Monica would have to give her up.",
        "Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.",
        "Emma.",
        "Oh whose side are you on? <back to Amy> I'm not giving you Emma because there is no way you could handle the responibility of a child.",
        "Forget the bubblewrap! There isn't time!",
        "Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma.",
        "So, so now do I get Joey?",
        "Wow! You look…er…hm……I mean, it’s just the…er…that, that dress! Er…",
        "No, no…they’re good. It’s just been so long since I’ve seen you like this. You clean up good!",
        "Oh, right! [Looking away]",
        "So, are you. Ah! Are you excited about your…er…first night away from Emma?",
        "Oh, it’s fine. Actually, I…I invited Mike over",
        "Yeah.",
        "We don’t. But, I thought that it would be nice to get to know him. You know? We have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.",
        "Well, but, you know, we have a lot in common, you know, erm…he plays the piano, I played keyboards in college, or, he’s been divorced, I have…some…experience in that area",
        "Rach, Rach, Rach: we’ll be fine. You go have fun.",
        "So, welcome!",
        "I’ve got bottled breast milk.",
        "Okay",
        "So, Phoebe tells me you, er, play the piano?",
        "You, you know? I used to play the keyboards in college.",
        "No",
        "Erm, you know, I’m divorced. Er, Phoebe said you’ve been divorced.",
        "[Lost for words] Yeah, er… that’s okay. We’ll talk about something else.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Ah!",
        "Well, he and I would probably have a lot to talk about.",
        "Shouldn’t the pizza be here by now? They said 30 minutes or less. How long has it been?",
        "I do. I do. Although it is actually a lager.",
        "I don’t know. We can look it up.",
        "So soon?",
        "Okay. Thanks, er, for the beer.",
        "Ah, yeah, good times.",
        "Ohh. [Relieved that Mike has gone]",
        "Hi!",
        "W-Why? [Blocking route of entry]",
        "[Exasperated] But, you left!",
        "[Looking bored] Maybe you should look up fascinating.",
        "I don’t understand what just happened here.",
        "You know, we just drank some beer…Mike played with the boundaries of normal social conduct…",
        "Rachel, lock the door, lock the door, seriously!",
        "Hello? Oh no, she’s not here right now. Can I take a message? Bill from the bar? Okay…Bill from the bar. I’ll make sure she gets your number.",
        "So, er, so how was it? Have you guys, you guys, had a good time?",
        "Ah, Rach?",
        "Never mind.",
        "Hey, you guys!",
        "Ah.",
        "You're really not coming back?",
        "I can't get *enough* dinosaurs!",
        "You got me a cola drink?",
        "Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you\nanother sweater.",
        "Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about\nthe Festival of Lights?",
        "Yeah!",
        "Years and years ago there were these people called the\nMaccabees...",
        "What are you doing here, Santa?",
        "I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent\nme here to give Ben some presents. Remember?",
        "(to Chandler) What are you doing?",
        "Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.",
        "Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and,\nand you're-you're wrecking it.",
        "I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.",
        "(in a low voice) Answer faster, answer faster!",
        "(in the same low voice) Answer better, answer better!",
        "Really? You're not gonna return it?",
        "Wow, it really is!",
        "Oh my god...",
        "What, you, you really quit your job?",
        "Oh, hey...",
        "(reading off his card) \"A donation has been made in your name\nto the New York City Ballet.\" -- How did you know?",
        "Hi guys.",
        "Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesn't she look cute?",
        "I think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? She's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts. Can I get a blue bow?",
        "Yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread.",
        "Good one, Rach.",
        "Rach we have a code brown situation.",
        "Alright, but you have to do one sometime.",
        "What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even...",
        "What about Emma? We don't have a nanny.",
        "Absolutely. Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.",
        "Fine, fine. (To Emma) We'll have fun, won't we? Yes, we will, yes we will. (Gives her a kiss, and the pink bow tapes itself to his head.)",
        "Huh?",
        "So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now?",
        "(Hugs Chandler) Good-bye.",
        "Yeah, and I was really hoping that I could hang out. What do you feel like doing?",
        "I don't feel like having s*x. Maybe we can watch a movie or something.",
        "Pants off Bing!",
        "Hey.",
        "You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.",
        "Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!",
        "You know what? I don't need a tie. I mean, it's better, open collar. You know, it's more casual (He leaves.)",
        "Hey you guys!",
        "Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly (points to Molly). Molly, Chandler, Joey.",
        "Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ....",
        "Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it.",
        "Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you - wovyou dovyou ...",
        "Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.",
        "What are you, a child?",
        "Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.",
        "Whazzup??",
        "Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?",
        "Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the \"hot nanny\".",
        "You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me?",
        "Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees. (pause)",
        "I am, yes.",
        "Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.",
        "We have to stop them before something happens!",
        "Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?",
        "Thanx.",
        "What do you think you're gonna do, have s*x with her right here on my couch?",
        "Yeah, come on in. Molly?",
        "Ok ... (they leave the room, long pause) Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have no problem.",
        "Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?",
        "OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?",
        "OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.",
        "Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,",
        "Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!",
        "No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but...at least she could have told me. You know",
        "I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.",
        "Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmental",
        "Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.",
        "That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?",
        "I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me",
        "No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.",
        "No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.",
        "You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there!",
        "You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? You...you break the",
        "Don't you have to be at work?",
        "Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in Europe? Here’s a question: \"Would you...",
        "Hi! I could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace",
        "Right, so that's a firm \"no\". I cannot believe this, I just keep striking out.",
        "This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.",
        "I know! (he stands)",
        "But, what’s great is that you don’t mind talking about it.",
        "Uh-ah!",
        "(pfew). Good choice Ross.",
        "Oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am.",
        "Oh, yeah, yeah that’s Michelle.",
        "Oh, just this woman I’ve been seeing.",
        "Yeah, didn’t I mention that? Yeah, I mean, we haven’t being going out for too long, but rather there is this",
        "How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that’s",
        "I told you about my daughter.",
        "I told you it wasn’t long, but there is an amazing connection between us.",
        "Are you kidding?",
        "We’ll see.",
        "I don’t know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?",
        "Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to sleep...",
        "When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a guy you know, for what? A week?",
        "Ok, Michelle, it’s time to go.",
        "Ok.",
        "You know, if it’s meant to be, I’ll guess it. Bye, bye.",
        "Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties on",
        "Oh, really!",
        "Oh, really!",
        "What about the guy from the bar?",
        "The guy you gave your number to.",
        "Because he called here looking for you. So don’t tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,",
        "What?",
        "Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you not look there?",
        "I never gave it to you.",
        "I don’t know.",
        "Who am I?",
        "I am the guy who’s taking care of our baby while you’re out at bars meeting guys!",
        "None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That’s not the point. Ok? The point is you...you are the one",
        "Uh, clearly.",
        "Yeah, maybe not. So what you wanna do?",
        "Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?",
        "Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Yeah, that'll do it.",
        "I'm, I'm okay. ",
        "Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce.",
        "No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people.",
        "Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me...",
        "Yeah? Any names come to mind?",
        "Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?",
        "Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.",
        "Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home alone.",
        "Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date.",
        "No! ",
        "Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be.",
        "Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to have s*x tonight.",
        "Just the crab cakes.",
        "What's - what's going on?",
        "What? You - you're making money off my misery?",
        "This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life. Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way.",
        "Hey, what's wrong?",
        "Oh. Crab cake?",
        "Well, what happened?",
        "Monica told me you had a blind date.",
        "I did, too.",
        "But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?",
        "Why does everyone keep saying that?",
        "That bad?",
        "Female body inspector? What size is that?",
        "The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters.",
        "Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's just stupid.",
        "I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the chances?",
        "So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?",
        "You know, if I didn't already have a job, I think, I would have been really good in advertising.",
        "Yes, I did, I did! (He turns to Joey, disappointed) I should have written it down!",
        "Oh, I can't. I've got a date with that waitress, Katy, yeah, I know we've been only going out like twice, but I have a really good feeling about her. ",
        "(taken aback) What?",
        "O-ok. Just relax, Phoene, just stay calm. (He searches his coat and freaks out). Oh my god, I can't find my wallet. ",
        "(still in a high-pitched voice) What do you mean \"no\"? I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay. ",
        "Yeah, a real pleasure.",
        "(shocked) Oh my god. Phoebe, you used to mug people? ",
        "Hey, you'll never guess what just happened… Phoebe and I got mugged!",
        "(sitting down) Yah, because Phoebe knew the mugger! ",
        "You wanna know how she knew him? (He points at Phoebe) Because Phoebe used to mug people. ",
        "Well, anyway, it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him, because (menacingly) I was about to do some serious damage! ",
        "Yeah, it was pretty traumatic. I was outside St. Marc's Comics… you know, I-I-I was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble got into that week- ",
        "Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen Linzer torts for someone… (He looks at Monica) … when outta nowhere this *** with a pipe jumps out and says: \"Gimme your money, punk!\"",
        "I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book: \"Science Boy\"",
        "A superhuman thirst for knowledge.",
        "Well, I-I better get to class (He stands up) Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way, Phoebe?",
        "Hey!",
        "No one ever asked me that, what's wrong? ",
        "Oh… (He looks positively surprised) Well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene…",
        "(disbelieving) Wh-What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.",
        "No, it wasn't.",
        "No, it wasn't. You don't think I would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old…",
        "(shocked) Oh my god, it was you! I can't believe it, you… you mugged me? ",
        "It's not the best!",
        "(indignant) There's nothing you can say. That was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me. ",
        "(interrupting) Hey, let's not do this! ",
        "Sure, go ahead. Whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead. (He raises his hands as if being mugged)",
        "(faking enthusiasm) Oh my god, crap from the street? (She smiles excitedly, but Ross just turns back to his newspaper) ",
        "Oh my god. (He sighs) I never thought I'd see this again. (He browses trough the pages) It's all here. What made you save it all these years? ",
        "You really thought \"Science Boy\" was worth saving! ",
        "Still… this is amazing… Oh my god, thank you, Phoebe. ",
        "You're welcome. ",
        "(entering) Hey, uhm, Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that…",
        "I see. You didn't happen to tell…",
        "Great. Thanks! (He leaves)",
        "Hi!",
        "I'd love to!",
        "Phoebe, what happened?",
        "Oh, don't worry about it! Just use your travel insurance.",
        "Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!",
        "Uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? I mean, two guys in a romantic inn...",
        "(browsing the brochure) I guess...It still seems a little...(enthusiastically) moonlight boat ride!!",
        "(in a strange voice and eating candies) The big apple!",
        "Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody.",
        "(high pitched voice) Check again please!",
        "Not there.",
        "(mumbling) She doesn't know what to say!",
        "Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves.",
        "Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm... I take six!",
        "C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!",
        "I think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple?",
        "(on the phone) Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? (pause) Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already? (pause) Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons.",
        "What did you get?",
        "Nice, put it with the others.",
        "We are four short of a bush-o (pause). God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!",
        "Oh, that's not cool.",
        "No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. (pause) Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt (he opens the salt shaker and pours the salt into his hand) I wish I'd thought this through.",
        "Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.",
        "No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!",
        "Let's celebrate with some maple candy!",
        "At least tell me where you hid it.",
        "Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game.",
        "Oh my god.",
        "There's something new in the bowl.",
        "No, but I want...I want the pinecones!",
        "It's not the same.",
        "(to the receptionist) Thank you for a delightful stay.",
        "Oh, my maple candy!",
        "(sounds excited) Hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...? (Looks around the room nervously) do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?",
        "Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!",
        "I can't believe you guys are moving in together. That's, that's great! I mean...I'm happy for you guys..",
        "Phoebe, I had no idea you were so conventional.",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for all hanging out but to come to my home!",
        "Why?",
        "Never?",
        "wow, are you still going to move in with him?",
        "Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.",
        "No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now but I can't help it. I love marriage.",
        "If you have to call me name, I prefer \"Ross the Divorcer\". It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I'm sorry.",
        "But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have so much fun and you love Mike.",
        "Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before, and you know what? You should be. It's a big deal!",
        "The Divorcer, to the rescue!",
        "Yeah I just hurt it.",
        "Hey! What do you guys think about this. \"Ross: The Divorce-Force\".",
        "Hey Pheebs, you know I'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the other day and I hope I was a little helpful.",
        "Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.",
        "Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?",
        "I don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so... normal.",
        "Hey hey, can I help?",
        "You know sometimes your words... they hurt.",
        "yeah thats a great idea!",
        "No thanks!",
        "(in a mocking voice)Uh...sure I do, and I also wanna be King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.",
        "The woman just vanished!",
        "No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.",
        "Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki.",
        "Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.",
        "(yelling to Monica)They're towing your car, they're towing your car!!",
        "(panting)They're towing a car. And I am seeing...spots.",
        "Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!",
        "(to Monica)Think he washed his hands?",
        "(mockingly)Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery!",
        "(mockingly)A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone else a chance!",
        "You know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp! (rubs lamp, stops because it's very hot) Ah!! That thing gets hot!!",
        "Uh, you're not gonna win.",
        "Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that.",
        "Why would I eat my own arm?",
        "Why?",
        "You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! Come here (they kiss and hug)",
        "I don't know, probably just invest it.",
        "Oh, I'm sorry, did I say \"invest it\"? I meant \"be cool and piss it all away\" (Joey and Chandler pleased)",
        "(to Rachel) Uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?",
        "Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel \"Mommy\" when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ...",
        "Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me \"Daddy\" too.",
        "I ... I was just talking about Rachel.",
        "(tries to be sexy too) Well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi .. (stops) no I can't.",
        "I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this together!",
        "3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ...",
        "Than I want mine, too (takes the bowl from Joey)! And if I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond.",
        "(trying to stop her) Hey, hey!!",
        "Monica!",
        "Go, go, go!!",
        "Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon...",
        "Oh yeah, it's a good idea!",
        "(on the phone) Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. And remember, you're daddy's little girl... (covering the phone, to Rachel) Phoebe's totally ruined that for me... (he passes the receiver to Rachel)",
        "Oh, we have one too!!",
        "(calling Rachel) Come on!!",
        "Oh yeah, no no no...that's great!",
        "Oh, Rach...oh...\"gleba\" is not a word.",
        "Okay, what does it mean?",
        "I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's first words (goes back to checking the tickets).",
        "Yes you did, gleba is a word!",
        "Ok, use it in a sentence.",
        "It's not a word!",
        "Oh, oh, ok, great. You know what, while you're at it she said another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look up: pbbqqt....",
        "She's gonna be a scientist! (kisses Rachel on the head, very moved)",
        "Me too. So much for my dinosaur/Amelia Earhart theme park.",
        "Seven.",
        "Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers.",
        "I guess if everybody else is...",
        "Oh yeah, let me just finish this.",
        "Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to.",
        "It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?",
        "Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident...",
        "No... I already e-mailed her.",
        "You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat.",
        "(he picks up the ball) What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes?? (he enters another room)",
        "(he comes back) Alright, let's go!",
        "I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!",
        "(yelling at Chandler) I have s*x with dinosaurs??",
        "That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long... (pause) It's not funny!!",
        "I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!",
        "You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.",
        "Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!",
        "(visibly upset) I'm dead?",
        "Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.",
        "Oh please, hit by a blimp?",
        "Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.",
        "You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay p0rn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.",
        "uhu uhu, check this out. (Chandler sits down and looks at laptop screen)",
        "Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little \"Ross is dead\" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead. (silence) Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?",
        "What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!",
        "I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy! (gets up from his sofa)",
        "You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.",
        "Exactly!! (sits back down at his laptop and starts typing)",
        "No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!",
        "oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...",
        "It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!",
        "Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner! (he hides in the bedroom and closes the door)",
        "Who is he?",
        "I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives. (they press their ears against the door)",
        "(coming in) I'm dead and no one cares?",
        "It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!",
        "Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?",
        "(sceptical) Yeah...",
        "(he bounds into the lounge room) But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!",
        "Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!",
        "(on the phone) No Mum, I'm not dead. I know it's not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's over, ok? (pause) Actually no, even if I had died, you would not be left childless. (pause) Monica?",
        "Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!",
        "Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did not kiss.",
        "Why do you care so much?",
        "Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils...",
        "Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with it...",
        "Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!",
        "I'm gonna get some more coffee.",
        "Ok. (they both go)",
        "Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people.",
        "Yeah, I know the type.",
        "Hi!",
        "(annoyed) Oh, do you, do you really?",
        "Look, if you don't know what the word \"acrimonious\" means, just don't use it!",
        "Get to the problem!",
        "(looking down) Are you wearing two belts?",
        "You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.",
        "You know, I really don't want to get involved in you guy's relationship.",
        "(after a short hesitation) Fine.",
        "Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!",
        "Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.",
        "Yeah, most of it it's a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!",
        "Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.",
        "But I'm not! (pause). You know what if you're in the mood for Thai food...",
        "Ok.",
        "Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.",
        "Now, do you have any idea what you just said?",
        "Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.",
        "Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time for this.",
        "Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!",
        "Wow. What does that mean?",
        "Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?",
        "Nah ah! Nah ah! (stops him form doing so) No no no! No ad-libbing and dude, you can't touch the paintings.",
        "No! (Slaps his hand)",
        "Haha! Got ya! Die, die, die!",
        "(recovers his composure and starts typing) Respectfully, professor R. Geller. (hits <return>, closes the laptop and joins Charlie on the sofa) Hey!",
        "Hey, how was the Met?",
        "Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?",
        "What do you mean?",
        "(perplexed for a moment) Wait a minute... when you guys walked into the Met, did you go to the right?",
        "(shaking head) Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together.",
        "What?",
        "What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.",
        "(slowly) Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.",
        "And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.",
        "That was going to be my next argument.",
        "Hey!",
        "Glad I could help man.",
        "Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett... (Ross starts snoring, faking to fall asleep)",
        "What? How come that you don't have to go!",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.",
        "(covering with his hand Chandler's face, like pretending he's not there) (to Monica) There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.",
        "It's I just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.",
        "(looking his elbow, where there's a patch) These aren't suede.",
        "Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller.",
        "Oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice.",
        "Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out.",
        "Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute.",
        "(hitting Monica with his suitcase) (to Charlie) We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover.",
        "I don't think so.",
        "Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is \"if you can't come on time, then don't come at all\". (pause) An option that many of my students use. (pause) Shall we?",
        "You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok?",
        "Oh, damn it!",
        "(very bored, he tries to avoid the conversation speaking to Charlie) So, where did you get your undergraduate degree?",
        "(to Charlie) Oh, it's not over!",
        "So basically all nuts?",
        "I've lost the will to live.",
        "What?",
        "Oh... ok, fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you, ehm... (aping Professor Spafford) When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll...",
        "(entering with Charlie) Oh, hey you guys! This is Charlie! Charlie, this is Phoebe and my sister, Monica.",
        "Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department.",
        "(to Phoebe) Ranion's theory of species variegation?",
        "Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny...",
        "Really? Wh-what's wrong?",
        "I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.",
        "(looking at them) Wh-what's going on?",
        "No, I arranged that...",
        "(to Charlie) So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?",
        "Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?",
        "You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?",
        "... And you called him Alby!? (laughs) I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...",
        "Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!",
        "(very interested) Oh! like what?! (Charlie looks at him confused, but smiling) Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch \"Access Hollywood\".",
        "Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?",
        "(a little suprised) Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart",
        "Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?",
        "Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?",
        "Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine? (takes the half-full glasses and goes to the counter)",
        "(sarcastically) Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.",
        "She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.",
        "Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!! (Rachel nods) Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God!",
        "Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians... (gestures with his hands and says in an impression voice?) \"Can we walk\"? (Phoebe starts laughing) Oh, you... you like that?",
        "What? (turns around to look at Rachel)",
        "Nice to meet you.",
        "Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology.",
        "Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.",
        "I'd lead with that.",
        "Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.",
        "It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize.",
        "Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.",
        "And sexy.",
        "Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her.",
        "Stop going through my stuff (walks away)!",
        "(to Rachel) Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?",
        "I'm smarter than him!",
        "(entering) Hey, you guys!",
        "Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?",
        "Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract (he and Charlie laugh, then Joey starts laughing too without any reason) Well, why are you laughing?",
        "Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today.",
        "Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him.",
        "Tsz... NO! (he goes to sit down, dropping a multicoloured silk streamer off his sleeve).",
        "Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.",
        "It's in Barbados.",
        "So-so what did the doctor say?",
        "How do you feel about all this?",
        "(puzzled) What?",
        "(looking astonished) What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!",
        "The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.",
        "(reading from a notepad) I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. (he throws the notepad in the waste bin) So-so what I am saying is - is is that (he picks the notepad back from the waste bin) is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!",
        "Oh, that's not what you want...",
        "Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?",
        "I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...",
        "It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!",
        "Barbados.",
        "What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.",
        "I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job!",
        "(To the still half asleep Professor) Oh my God! You really want me to be the keynote speaker? Thank you! (hugs him whilst still on his lap)",
        "... finally...",
        "God, you're amazing... I didn't even have to ask you to call me that.",
        "Weh...*sigh*",
        "Yeah, It's just... I don't think I can do this...",
        "No, NO! (they're moving to the side of the bed, where they sit down) Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it.",
        "Alright, I'm gonna go find them... (twitches a bit, looks down) I just need a... need a before I can... you know. (gestures standing up... they sit and wait for a while) Grandma... grandma... grandma... (he tries to concentrate...) Okay, I see you later.",
        "Hey, what are you guys doing?",
        "Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?",
        "Well, if you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him?",
        "Thanks! (walks out of the room and starts hugging the wall) Thank you! (closes the door)",
        "(knocks on door) Rach, you there? (Joey and Rachel both get up from the bed)",
        "(knocks) Rach?",
        "Is everything okay?",
        "Hey.",
        "You know where Joey is?",
        "Can I talk to you for a minute?",
        "And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.",
        "And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.",
        "Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?",
        "You know, I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace.",
        "Seriously... What is it?",
        "What's wrong?",
        "Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do that again... (and she/he moves in for another kiss. Joey, pushes her head away again...)",
        "Hey!",
        "You guys ready to go?",
        "Dude! You're not taking your Bible?",
        "Learn about Jesus...",
        "Hey!",
        "Uh, no... no. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.",
        "Stop it!",
        "You're filthy!",
        "Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.",
        "Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.",
        "You've never said that in your life, have you?",
        "I thought so.",
        "Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie.",
        "No, I'll do it. (he quickly grabs Joey's boarding pass and gives Joey his one.)",
        "Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says \"duty free\".",
        "Hey Rach...",
        "Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?",
        "Hey!",
        "So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.",
        "Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and..., well...",
        "Wha... (gasps) What? What would give you that idea?",
        "Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay.",
        "What?",
        "Are you serious?",
        "I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?",
        "No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous...",
        "You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...",
        "Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...",
        "Thanks!",
        "Hi!",
        "Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is... He is an amazing guy.",
        "Well, I'm so excited about this.",
        "Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...",
        "(gasps) Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God, I missed you. (kisses her) Oh Emma, I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle? (to Rachel)",
        "Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.",
        "(unpacking his bag) Okay, shoot!",
        "(gasps) OH NO!",
        "Oh, major shampoo explosion!",
        "Oh, it's all over everything. Why? Why me? (looks up)",
        "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?",
        "Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?",
        "Duh, you think? (enters the kitchen)",
        "Oh, that's right! (to Emma) Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right?",
        "(to Emma) Can you say Barbados?",
        "Ok, I gotta say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right! (he gives them their passes) This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.",
        "Oh, right, because he's a scientist!",
        "Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow.",
        "It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!",
        "(very excited) Look at all these paleontologists!!",
        "Wow! This is very flattering, uh...",
        "Uh, uh... Sure! Um... \"Dear...\" (he takes the notepad)",
        "\"... Sarah. I dig you\", Uh? \"Doctor Ross Geller\".",
        "Yeah, oh and Sarah... I'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, Professor Wheeler, a-and this is Joey Tribbiani.",
        "Dude, it's just \"Days of Our Lives\"... there's no the.",
        "Hey!",
        "(Excited) You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!",
        "Yeah, she never misses these conferences! (then to Charlie) No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!",
        "Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?",
        "(to Charlie) Ready to go?",
        "Yeah.",
        "(a little embarassed by their conversation) I'm good, I have dinner plans (moves away from them).",
        "Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?",
        "By using CT scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century.",
        "Oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. (Someone knocks on the door, Ross goes to open and it's Joey, Rachel and Chandler).",
        "The chocolates aren't here yet.",
        "If you want to check your email, just ask! (Chandler tries to look offended)",
        "Wha... what do you mean? (Goes to the laptop)",
        "What, oh my God. What did you do?",
        "Why, why would you open it?",
        "What did it say?",
        "What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler!",
        "NO! I don't!!",
        "Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!",
        "Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!",
        "Get out! (Chandler runs out)",
        "Well, what do you do?",
        "I can't believe this. I can't believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?",
        "I don't think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now, Joe!",
        "Wha... what you really think we can do that?",
        "Alright, ok, let's do it. (Ross sits down at the desk and they all gather around him) Um, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... um, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello! (Rachel and Joey look confused) And then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic.",
        "Yeah, that's it?",
        "Oh my God, we did it! (he sits beside her and skims through her notes excitedly)",
        "Yes, but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products. This is amazing, thank you, thank you so much. (he leans in, and they look at each other for a moment) That's a pretty necklace.",
        "Hey, what do you say we celebrate? Champagne? (he goes to get the champagne)",
        "Oh my God, I love you.",
        "That's Ben, my son from my first marriage.",
        "Yeah.",
        "No. (they clink glasses and drink)",
        "(embarassed) Oh, it was... it's complicated, you know? She... she was... eh... gay.",
        "Ok, odd thing to get excited about!",
        "Hey! High-five! (they high-five)",
        "My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. She didn't get any fitter.",
        "I know! It's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know? I mean, call, or leave a note: \"Hi, I just dropped by to say your wife's gay\"",
        "And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?",
        "(embarassed) Me neither.",
        "Yep, we got it, we got it. (To Charlie) Thank you so much.",
        "Good night.",
        "(from across the wall) Walls are pretty thin, guys!",
        "Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.",
        "Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus...",
        "And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.",
        "But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...",
        "... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...",
        "(concluding his speech)... in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century. (pauses) Thank you!",
        "Oh, thanks guys!",
        "Oh!",
        "(with a frozen smile on his face, realizing something's wrong with Jarvis) Ok... now... now we're just holding hands! (pulls his hand away)",
        "Oh, thank you so much!",
        "(puzzled) Ok!... All right, thanks! Thank you so much, you guys! (to Phoebe) Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!",
        "(skating over, embarrassed) Ok!... Uh... excuse me? Yeah?",
        "Hey! (she turns to him) Well...? (in expectation)",
        "Yeah?",
        "Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean... uh, did you know you were (giggles) mouthing the words along with me?",
        "No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!",
        "(joking) I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!",
        "(realizing his joke wasn't so good, but still giggling) Look, I took it too far!",
        "Ooh, well. Ah, I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that I wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man. (Mr. Oberblau giggles)",
        "Get Out!",
        "Yes, please! (they move and sit down on a sofa) So, what's going on?",
        "Oh my God, wh-what happened?",
        "I knew that was him!",
        "(holding her hand) Hey, you ok?",
        "Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here.",
        "(standing) Ok, gentlemen! Please! Aren't we a little old for this? I mean, we're scientists, right? We're academics. And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first. (he starts to run away with Charlie). GO, GO, GO! (the paleontologists starts chasing them)",
        "Hi.",
        "Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores. (pause) You know, we as a group are not the coolest.",
        "I don't think they saw us.",
        "(apparently unruffled) Oh. Can I... can I ask who?",
        "I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so...",
        "I'm sorry... we... we can't.",
        "I mean, you just went out with my best friend, and I just think it'd be a really really bad idea. (pause) Or-or not! (they kiss passionately)",
        "(looking at Monica's legs) WOW!",
        "I'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?",
        "Eh, you got a spray-on tan?",
        "(laughing) Why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?",
        "Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean, it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!",
        "So, do you get colours or just French tips?",
        "Thanks. (he takes the card) Hey, I know where this place is! It used to be an X-rated video... (pauses when he realizes what he is saying) florist. (he goes away)",
        "Well... I like how you look, what are you?",
        "Two, I think a two.",
        "Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.",
        "Well, I have a PhD, so... (assistant walk out, not impressed by this statement)\n(Ross takes his bathrobe off and he enters the tanning booth. He stands up in front of the red light and the sprayer starts and sprays his face and torso)",
        "One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis...(the sprayer starts again, spraying him in the face and torso again) WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've not finished counting!! (he leaves the booth) (the assistant enters the room)",
        "You sprayed my front twice!",
        "No, I barely even got to three Mississippi.",
        "Mississippilesly? (pause) Well, how bad is it?",
        "So, how dark is it gonna get?",
        "I'm a four?",
        "(sarcastically) Really!",
        "(annoyed) Ok!",
        "Wait, wait a minute, there's no light on the back wall! How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello? (he slowly turns and the spraying begins, on his face) Ah, oh, ah! (he turns, but then he turns again and is sprayed in the front again) Ah! (he spits and angrily goes out of the spray-on tan booth and the assistant enters the room) The same thing happened again!",
        "(hysterically) I'm an eight!",
        "I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.",
        "Oh! And it gets worse! (Turns his side to Chandler and Monica and pulls up his shirt. There's a distinct line across his body, where his belly is very tanned and his back is very pale.)",
        "(looks at her suspiciously) How do you count to five?",
        "(Yells) Damnit! (Goes to the door to leave. Rachel just enters, sees him and starts laughing)",
        "(Still yelling) I Know!",
        "I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them all on my back.",
        "Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?",
        "Which... which... which... Which one is it?",
        "OH! SON OF A BITCH!",
        "Go away! I don't want to see anybody.",
        "Really? Did you count Mississipily?",
        "Dude, you're not tanned.",
        "Yeah!",
        "No.",
        "C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.",
        "Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird s*x stuff to my little sister.",
        "(he enters) Hey guys!",
        "Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.",
        "Yeah!",
        "That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?",
        "Ah, and where is Joey?",
        "(taping Joey with the cam) Hey, there is uncle Joey!",
        "Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!",
        "Joey, NO!",
        "When they see this you'll be 52!",
        "(points the camcorder towards them to record their entrance) Hey!",
        "(pointing the camcorder at himself) There's something you didn't know about your dad!",
        "Oh, great!",
        "Thank you so much for that gift!",
        "Amazing... amazing.",
        "Sure.",
        "Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?",
        "I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.",
        "Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby’s face off the pen1s, so we can put it on the bunny. (pause). That is a weird sentence!",
        "Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.",
        "Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh? (takes the camcorder and points it at Monica and Chandler) Ok!",
        "You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?",
        "(Into receiver) Hello? (listens) Oh no! What happened? (listens some more) Ok ok, where are you? (Grabs a pen and starts writing). Ok, I'll be right there. (Puts the phone down)",
        "No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her.",
        "No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?",
        "Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves! (leaves)",
        "RACHEL!",
        "(sarcastically) I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else. (he opens the box)",
        "Rach, she's not going to remember this.",
        "(looks back at the cake) Hey!",
        "It's not bad.",
        "Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.",
        "Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.\n[ Scene: Rachel and Joey's apartment. Chandler, Monica and Emma are sitting on the floor, and Emma's stuffed animals are lined up in front of them.]",
        "Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.",
        "Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means...",
        "Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake.",
        "Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow out the candle. Come on Emma.",
        "What's wrong? Are you okay?",
        "Okay, you ready?",
        "A-a-and... record.",
        "Pheebs, what's wrong?",
        "So, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech prepared, or (in a tender way) did he cry? (the guys look at him) Yeah, big surprise, I like proposals!",
        "(to Charlie) Hey!",
        "Guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant! I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you.",
        "Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not that I'm keeping score or anything... five!",
        "Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there will be an article about me in the \"Paleontology Review\"! Yeah! That'll be the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious questions about my work!",
        "Yeah. Why?",
        "Your ex-boyfriend?",
        "So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!",
        "Well, if you think it would help.",
        "Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know, butter him up? Anything he really likes?",
        "We'll see how dinner goes.",
        "I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart. I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO?",
        "Well, I... I am having a good hair day.",
        "I'm ok.",
        "It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize, (he thumbs up) whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons I got into the field.",
        "No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... (laughs nervously)tzz-zzz, mmm.",
        "Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.",
        "See, there are still several areas that haven't been fully excavated.",
        "What?",
        "Did you just say \"break up with Charlie\"?",
        "Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?",
        "Are you serious?",
        "No!",
        "(Rolls his eyes) I guess!",
        "(shocked and confused by the question) What? I... I... (Benjamin looks at him as if to say \"What's wrong? Answer the question\")",
        "(annoyed) May 12th?",
        "(even more shocked) Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.",
        "Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my questions have anything to do with Paleontology.",
        "(annoyed) um... I've never heard of a \"Boscodictiasaur\".",
        "(stares at him angrily) Ok. (determined to spell it correctly) B - O - S ...",
        "Oh come on!!\n[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment. Chandler and Rachel are talking.]",
        "Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? (Now yelling) Aunt Margaret's pants size?",
        "(Sarcastic) No! Stop!",
        "(Skeptical) Really?",
        "I have to break up with Charlie?",
        "You're crazy.",
        "Crazy!",
        "(Yelling) Get out! (Benjamin leaves)\n[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment.]",
        "Your ex-boyfriend is insane.",
        "No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.",
        "Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't give you up.",
        "Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of \"Underdog\"?",
        "If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.",
        "Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?",
        "Damnit!\n[Scene: Benjamin's office. Ross and Charlie are entering.]",
        "I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the voice of Underdog!",
        "No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.",
        "Too little, too late, Benji!",
        "(indignant) No!",
        "What?",
        "or...",
        "Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable.",
        "Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!",
        "Hey...",
        "(surprised) Oh... (he pauses) (sounds disappointed) Ohh... I'd love to but I really have to grade these papers.",
        "(Writing on the papers) B, B, B, B, B!",
        "Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt.",
        "Damnit!",
        "(he opens the door) Hi Amy!",
        "Still sharp as a tack!",
        "(pause) Ross? I... I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving together last year... I had a baby with your sister!",
        "(gives up) Yes, yes, you did.",
        "Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!",
        "Ehm... Her name is Emma.",
        "What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!",
        "(to Joey) Oh my God!",
        "What... what you working on?",
        "Why don't you use your Thesaurus?",
        "Watch. (he takes the laptop) Here, you ehm... You highlight the word you want to change.\nGo under Tools and the Thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list of choices. You can pick the word that sounds smartest.",
        "Seriously?",
        "Well, do you wanna marry him?",
        "Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!",
        "No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting?",
        "I don't think that's what this is.",
        "(He interrupts her immediately, and drags her by her arm to the other side of the room) Well, can I talk to you for a sec.?",
        "Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child.",
        "Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!",
        "Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.",
        "(a little confused) Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby.",
        "I... I don't know..",
        "Hey guys. ",
        "Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see. (Wants to take the hat off, but Rachel tries to stop him).",
        "Why not?",
        "Come here (Removes Emma's hat) Oh! There she is! Hi!",
        "(sees how strangely Monica, Chandler and Rachel are looking at him) What?",
        "(Back to Emma) Hi! (Looks at her) What... (Moves the stroller away from him so he can get a better look at her. He looks at her confused. Finally he realizes the difference and gasps). Please tell me those are clip-ons.",
        "Did she (points at Amy) do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have left Emma with her!",
        "That's not a thing!",
        "(very angry) Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna...",
        "(pointing at Amy, shouting) No more falafel for you!",
        "So you two are..?",
        "And have you .. ed?",
        "But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?",
        "I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?",
        "Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you. (Squeaky.) I'm fine!",
        "Absolutely. (Very Squeaky.) I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really, (deep voice) I'm fine. I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. I mean, at first I was like.. (Screams.) But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this.",
        "It's all working out! Me & Charlie, and you two. You know what we should do?",
        "No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!!",
        "Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!! (Storms off.)",
        "I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie! (Kisses her.) Hi Joey. (Hugs him.) And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. (Laughs.) I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know. (He squeezes her hand.) Come, please come in. Come in.",
        "Oh! That is so thoughtful. (To Joey.) She's a keeper. And what did you bring me? (Grabs the bag that Charlie brought for Joey.)",
        "Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!",
        "What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?",
        "You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.",
        "The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.",
        "Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.",
        "I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness, no tension.",
        "We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?",
        "My fajitas!!",
        "Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!",
        "That is gonna hurt tomorrow!",
        "Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.",
        "And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is life without love?",
        "O is for \"oh, wow!\" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.",
        "Totally.",
        "No!",
        "Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!",
        "Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.",
        "Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good.",
        "I don't even know what that's for.",
        "Thanks. Did you stay here all night?",
        "So you took off my pants and shoes?",
        "What do you mean?",
        "Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!",
        "Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?",
        "This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?",
        "Joey.",
        "And she feels the same way?",
        "Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.",
        "No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?",
        "Yeah, I'm sure.",
        "Hey!",
        "Come on, she's gonna love you guys!",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Hey you guys, I need some fashion advice.",
        "(he takes a baby blue beret out of a shopping box and puts it on) How does this look?",
        "C'mon! This looks good!",
        "Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!",
        "Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress.",
        "You're wearing the same shirt.",
        "You know, we should just go, I’m not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!",
        "Rach, come on, I’m not gonna wear any of this! (he picks up a shirt) Nothing silver. (Rachel sighs). Ok? Nothing with hair! (Rachel sighs again) And nothing with padlocks on it! (Rachel heaves a long disappointing sigh).",
        "(feeling the fabric) Wow, this is really soft (he looks the price). Three hundred and fifty dollars?",
        "Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.",
        "Wow!",
        "Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah!(he turns and watches his back and there’s a sign on the back of the jacket, “boys will be boys”) Boys will be boys?",
        "All right, that’s it, I’m getting out of here.",
        "Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.",
        "Really?",
        "So, you’re saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?",
        "(to Joey) So? What do you think? (Shows himself - Joey observes him with a strange look on his face.)",
        "(not getting it) Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.",
        "Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?",
        "You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me (getting up and taking his coat) I have a date. (As he is walking out, everyone turns and stares at him) See? (To Joey) ALL eyes on ME!",
        "Oh! You are gonna love it! (The girl is looking in the other direction as Ross is taking off his own coat, revealing the pink and white ladies shirt) and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this.",
        "Here (gets behind her to help. When the coat comes off we see she is wearing the exact same shirt Ross is wearing. They look at each other, shocked. They abruptly put their coat back on) So this was fun! (They leave the room and head into opposite directions)",
        "Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.",
        "Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date?",
        "Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?",
        "Hey you guys!",
        "Hey, what are you doing?",
        "Yeah!",
        "There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.",
        "Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.",
        "I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!",
        "No, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset. [pause] But maybe the time after that!",
        "(he enters) Hi!",
        "Oh, good!",
        "Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.",
        "There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under a bridge!",
        "Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!",
        "Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire!",
        "Be-caaauuuse...",
        "Seriously?",
        "(sarcastic) And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie!",
        "Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and you'll see!",
        "Space is filled with orbiting children. (pause) Look, please, just come on, you know, when you’ll see the look on Emma’s face, I swear you won’t regret it.",
        "Good, you don’t want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you?",
        "Oh, yeah, that’s the same, I am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings!\n[Scene: Monica’s apartment. Somebody knocks the door]",
        "Ok.",
        "Rach, she’s got like three hairs!",
        "I promise you she’s safe! No watch how much she loves this.",
        "Here we go! (He starts pushing Emma)",
        "See, I told you!",
        "Oh, absolutely!",
        "Ok! (he takes the camera and walks backwards to take a shot) See? Scared of swings, I bet you feel pretty silly (a swinging boy knocks him down) Ow!",
        "SON OF A BITCH! (turns to his right to see three kids staring at him) (To the\nkids) Oh relax! I didn't say the 'F' word! (They go away)",
        "No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault and kind\nof that (point to the kid that kicked him) kids fault. Who is still laughing. Nice.",
        "No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing, okay? And\nyou'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of.",
        "Look, I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your silly\nfears.",
        "Good.",
        "(He freaks out and starts jumping around brushing his sweater) WHAT? WHERE? WHERE?",
        "I know. (Rachel bends down to Emma and Ross looks over his shoulder again,\nafraid)\n[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment. Chandler is still leaning against the door, keeping Joey out, who is still banging and shouting on the other side.]",
        "(nervously) Ok...",
        "(Gasps and speaks at a higher pitch) This feels perfectly normal. Ok, get on the swing!",
        "See?",
        "There you go! Good for you! And you know what, I'm actually getting used to this little guy. I don't really even feel him in here anymore.",
        "Well... (realizes, screaming like a little girl, trying to get rid of the spider) Whaa... aaah... aaahhh...",
        "Are you kidding?",
        "(skeptical) That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!",
        "She's putting words in your mouth!",
        "Hey! Hey, guess what Joey has!",
        "Dude, I wanted him to guess.",
        "Guess where they are?",
        "Did I do something to you?",
        "So?",
        "He's right, man.",
        "We're still going at the game, right?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh! What a game, huh?",
        "I can't believe Chandler is missing this!",
        "Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.",
        "I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice (Joey looks around worried hoping no one heard that) I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!",
        "Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal.",
        "One more fight!",
        "Okay.",
        "Forty-five minutes.",
        "(handing him his coat) Here!",
        "You may want to lose the foam finger!",
        "Hey!",
        "We're late too! (Rachel screams)",
        "So, nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us!",
        "Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy!",
        "You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee.",
        "Let me see this... (he takes the trophy from Rachel's hands) Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division.",
        "You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?",
        "I can't believe this, she's our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!",
        "So this is an annual thing?",
        "Yeah. What are we gonna do?",
        "Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged! You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged!",
        "(to Joey) HEY!",
        "I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.",
        "(sarcastic) That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.",
        "(Reading the note) We know you're out there. (Rachel gasps)",
        "Well, let's just go in there and face them.",
        "What is that?",
        "Wha...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're having s*x on the couch, its like: \"Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy\".",
        "Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down.",
        "(to Joey, who is wearing a blue, 3 foot hand) FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!! (takes it off his hand and throws it on the floor)",
        "How are we gonna decide who gets this?",
        "That's worse than no food.",
        "I don't know...",
        "(Staring back, and then breaks off) (To Phoebe and Rachel) Yeah, he can do it!",
        "I feel terrible.",
        "Really girls, not cool.",
        "It's a day to be thankful.",
        "Yeah! Let's go out.",
        "Okay.",
        "I gave them to Joey.",
        "(looking at Joey's butt) I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.",
        "Nice!",
        "I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.",
        "Food.",
        "Oh my God. It's like Sophie's Choice.",
        "I just can’t see Chandler cheating!",
        "I know, and with the baby coming?",
        "I don’t know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?",
        "No one, I’m just saying if... (Phoebe starts pinching him in his neck)",
        "(yelling in pain) I know nothing! Mike’s a great guy, it was hypothetical!",
        "Believe me, if I did see with someone, there’s no way I... (Phoebe starts pinching him again)",
        "We think Chandler might be having an affair.",
        "What's going on?",
        "Oh my God.",
        "(sarcastic) So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?",
        "You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.",
        "(to Joey) It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay (back to Mon and Chan), but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.",
        "What?",
        "You put an offer on a house?",
        "Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?",
        "You can see where he'd have trouble.",
        "That money is mine, Green!",
        "What was Monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?",
        "Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie…",
        "Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...",
        "Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?",
        "Two seconds...",
        "11, unbelievable, 11 is correct. (The guys celebrate.)",
        "(to the girls) Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl’s breast?",
        "No, 19.",
        "Joey had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?",
        "Correct, his profession was?",
        "Correct! What is Chandler Bing’s job?",
        "10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.",
        "Don’t blame the questions!",
        "Chandler!!! Chandler!!! (He opens the door to the apartment but is stopped by the chain; Chandler and Monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.) Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!",
        "What the hell are doing?!!",
        "(To Chandler) I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!",
        "(happily) My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. (He hugs them both.)",
        "And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.",
        "You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good. (Joey pats Ross on his back)",
        "Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window.",
        "Love you guys. (he kisses Monica, he, Rachel and Phoebe leave.)",
        "I love this. (he got a sweater)",
        "Seriously you guys, what's going on? What are these for?",
        "Really? Which one?",
        "Things you find in the ocean, (to Joey) You're gonna be on \"Pyramid\"!!",
        "Except for \"Match game\"...",
        "Oh, and Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing. I can't believe you get to meet Donny Osmond.",
        "(very excited) Yeah-uh!",
        "(singing) \"...and I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll\"!",
        "So weird to see all these people again... Oh my God, look, there's Geoffrey Cleric.",
        "He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff.",
        "Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her.",
        "Dude. You're married to my sister.",
        "Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I should ask her out?",
        "Yes please.",
        "Hey. Hey, check out the flyers for the band. I made 'em on a Macintosh in the computer room!",
        "Thanks to a little something called \"Helvetica Bold 24 point\"!",
        "Hey, Missy...",
        "Yeah, yeah. You should come check us out. We're called \"Way! No Way!\".",
        "Way!",
        "Boss!",
        "She's gone.",
        "Dude, I was gonna ask her out.",
        "Well, I thought it first, Holmes.",
        "Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want.",
        "Me too. I'm good at it.",
        "You got it.",
        "Those are the pacts!",
        "Oh, oh... maybe not you!",
        "Thank you. (they shake hands) All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?",
        "I know, and I can't stop sweating. (he walks towards Missy)",
        "So, Saturday night!",
        "Great!",
        "Oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly, but, do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?",
        "It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.",
        "That's ok. Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!",
        "Yeah, why?",
        "You did?",
        "(angrily) AND ON MY TURF?",
        "(To Chandler) You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that, after you promised me?",
        "You broke the pact!",
        "That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.",
        "I didn't.",
        "No.",
        "NO!",
        "Hey! Hey Adrienne. (They move away from her)",
        "I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.",
        "I don't know what... you're talking about.",
        "Listen Adrienne, you can't tell Chandler about this.",
        "Cool! (They start kissing again and Chandler looks shocked)",
        "I didn't know you knew about that.",
        "(looks disappointed in himself) Man... I... I'm sorry.",
        "So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even.",
        "We are even, right?",
        "(thinks about it for a few seconds) What did you do to my mom?",
        "Hey, where's Rachel?",
        "Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?",
        "Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.",
        "Well, it matters to me.",
        "Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.",
        "Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.",
        "Mine.",
        "No, she was definitely on my bed.",
        "Well, then who was on my bed?",
        "(realizing) NO! No, no!",
        "You were under the pile of coats?",
        "OH MY GOD!",
        "You were my first kiss with Rachel?",
        "Hi! (he kisses Phoebe)",
        "Oh, (he goes towards Mike in order to shake hands but Mike hugs him) hey, oh... I... I was-I was going for a hand shake.",
        "That is why!",
        "Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?",
        "I wanna say it's not looking good.",
        "What? (Ross and Chandler don't know what to say, so there's an embarrassing long pause)",
        "Oh, man!",
        "FOOTBALL!",
        "I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.",
        "And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it...",
        "Who cares, AND?",
        "I'll do it!",
        "No, Mike, no, no. You wanna pick me, I mean... watch! (he mimics the groommens way of walking down the aisle with a bridesmaid) Huh?",
        "(to Chandler) Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.",
        "Please, you're going down!",
        "Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?",
        "So, what did you decide?",
        "I'll do it! (Monica approaches)",
        "Hey!",
        "Where's Rach?",
        "I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! (he goes to Rachel's room, knocks the door and enters the room). (very fake gasp) Oh! My God! You're breathtaking!",
        "You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?",
        "I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!",
        "Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!",
        "(waving his fist in the air in triumph) YES, YES!",
        "(smiling to himself) Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.",
        "(barely containing himself at this point) Well, you have fun tonight.",
        "Oh, I will.",
        "Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you?",
        "I'm not supposed to tell you!",
        "Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again. (he winks at her and Rachel looks disgusted)",
        "What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose.",
        "(to Rachel) Haha! Looks like you're not going to be in the wedding either. (Looks at Phoebe) So sorry Pheebs.",
        "(To Phoebe and Mike) I can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today.",
        "I'll do it!",
        "No, but Chandler, hello... Aren't you scared of dogs?",
        "(takes Chappy from Mike) Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then. Ha haaa... (smells Chappy) He stinks!",
        "Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free.",
        "I'll...",
        "It's the dog.",
        "Uh Joey...",
        "Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.",
        "Come on Chappy, do your business. MAKE! MA-AKE! I did not sign on for this.",
        "Joey, you shouldn't lie on your résumé.",
        "(whispering) It was ok...",
        "(he enters) Hey.",
        "You guys know where Rachel is?",
        "So unbelievable. She was supposed to meet me half an hour ago with Emma. (he tries to take a cookie but Monica slaps his hand)",
        "Hey!",
        "What? She's gonna eat all those cookies?",
        "So, why is Erica coming to visit?",
        "(looking at Rachel entering with Emma) Oh, hi! Hi! Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!",
        "No, no, no, I'm sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barney's?",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Is-is he ok?",
        "Ok, ok. I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you, I mean, you can't be alone right now.",
        "Still-still, let me come... for me.",
        "I bet someone could use one of Monica's freshly baked cookies.",
        "Oh!",
        "And I'm Doctor Ross Geller.",
        "Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here, because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, I don't want to infect him.",
        "I'm not scared of him, I'm really sick!",
        "I'm feeling better.",
        "He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine!",
        "Did the TV wake you?",
        "Ouchy.",
        "Well, I came with Rachel, who should be back any second! (pause) So what's new?",
        "Right, is it painful?",
        "Nope, just the one. RACH!",
        "Hey!",
        "I was gonna make us some dinner but all I found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream. (pause) I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.",
        "Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great.",
        "Wow.",
        "Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room.",
        "Yeah, sure, right! Like I've ever been in Rachel Green's room.",
        "Sorry. (Rachel sits on her bed). You ok?",
        "You had a rough day, uh?",
        "But we do! (pause) It's gonna be ok, Rach!",
        "What? No, no! Hey, hey, hey look...",
        "They gave him a lot of medication, ok? He wouldn't even know if you were there. Look, we'll go see him first thing in the morning, ok?",
        "No, God! Hey, Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, ok? Right now you just need to get some rest.",
        "(he kisses her on her forehead) Good night.",
        "Sure!",
        "Oh, of course...",
        "Me too. Come here. (They hug)",
        "Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or...(There's one of those moments. They're staring at each other, no word uttered, and then she leans toward him in order to kiss him, but he ducks and avoids her more than once.) Oh, oh. (he then hugs her and when she tries to kiss him again, he stands up and she falls down on the bed). No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea.",
        "No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.",
        "Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go!",
        "I'll see you in the morning (he leaves).",
        "(outside her room, talking by himself) Haven't had s*x in four months, I should get a medal for that!",
        "Hey Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?",
        "You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?",
        "You sure you're alright?",
        "(knowing she's not alright) O-kay. Well, I'm gonna go grab us some breakfast. (He starts to leave)",
        "(knew this was coming) There it is... (he comes back)",
        "(half amused) Wait, wait, (looks around a little) You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.",
        "(acknowledging the last part of her sentence) Well...",
        "I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding.",
        "Hey, I was looking out for you.",
        "I gotta say, I have not had s*x a lot of times before, this is the worst ever.",
        "Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having s*x again.",
        "That's right, s*x is off the table. (The door starts to open behind him and Dr. Green emerges) I am never having s*x with you again. (Rachel stays quiet and after a few moments Ross realizes what has happened. He turns abruptly) Dr. Green, are you feeling better? (Rachel's dad glares at him with a deadly look)",
        "Emma's down for the night.",
        "So uh... I guess I wanna take off.",
        "Oh, no problem.",
        "Thank you. I'm glad you agree.",
        "Yeah... Yeah, that's true.",
        "Oh, ye-ah!",
        "...Valentine's day...",
        "Hmmm-mmmm.",
        "Not even once.",
        "Even if we want it really bad.",
        "Uhm, right!",
        "Yeah.",
        "...I hate waste.",
        "Yes?",
        "Damn it. It's never off the table. (he leaves the apartment)\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK",
        "Joey, you shouldn't lie on your résumé.",

        "Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...",
        "Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.",
        "No, no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?",
        "Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.",
        "Mhm, (he balance things) packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.",
        "What are you guys doing?",
        "You got it! (Monica leaves, Ross closes the door). All right, she's right, we gotta get serious. (He grabs a bag of styrofoam peanuts) Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!",

        "Great.",
        "Here she is!",

        "(to Phoebe) Hey. What was that all about?",
        "Are you kidding? Oh my God...",

        "(to Joey) Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing.",
        "Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.",
        "I don't think so.",

        "Yeah...",
        "Huh?",
        "What? I don't get a goodbye?",

        "I don't get a goodbye?",
        "(talking agitated and angry) Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things.",
        "Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... (makes choking noises) IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris. (He leaves the apartment. Rachel looks kind of desperate.)",
        "That's what it seemed like.",

        "Yeah, yeah! (they hug) You sure this is what you want?",
        "Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day. How can I be okay with this?",
        "Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it?",
        "I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off.",
        "I didn't say we were brothers.",
        "May I help you?\nRoss: Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.",
        "Close. Ron. (shakes hands)",
        "Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.",
        "Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll see if she wants to come back.",
        "Look, she loved her job here. And let's face it: you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isn't that true?",
        "(surprised) Huh, I took a shot there.",
        "I see... Thanks very much. (he gets up and walks to the door. On his way out he looks at the photographs Mr Zelner has near his door. He picks one up.) Is this your son?\nMr Zelner: Yeah, his name is Ross. (Ross looks very surprised) What?",
        "Oh, nothing, it’s just, it’s close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?",
        "How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. (Mr. Zellner looks shocked). I just heard it as you must have heard it and that’s not good. Let me start again. I’m a paleontologist, you’ll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones… fossils!",
        "You let Rachel come back, and it’s done.",
        "Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life.",

        "Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.",
        "Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.",
        "All right, Julie. What a manipulative bitch.",
        "Come on, they were not that huge.",
        "You don't have birds.",
        "All right, bye-bye.",
        "\"Oh, my, god.\"",
        "We won. We won!",
        "How did this happen?",
        "Ok, so let's talk money.",
        "Have you ever seen so much crap?",
        "Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.",
        "What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.",
        "Well, what about my stuff?",
        "You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?",
        "Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.",
        "Ok, while you \"mmm\" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.",
        "What?",
        "Monica, let it go.",
        "Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.",
        "I am. Let me just get my coat.",
        "Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?",
        "Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.",
        "Ok, you win.",
        "Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.",
        "She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.",
        "Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.",
        "You are ready to make a commitment!",
        "What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?",
        "Thank you.",
        "It's really not that big!",
        "[entering hurriedly] Did I miss it? Did I miss it?",
        "I'm sorry, what?",
        "That's great!",
        "What do you mean?",
        "Ok, who ordered what?",
        "Oh god.",
        "I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?",
        "Mom!",
        "Pretty much.",
        "This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.",
        "Oh Mom!",
        "Really?",
        "Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.",
        "I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?",
        "For...me.",
        "Well, what do you mean?",
        "Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.",
        "None.",
        "No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?",
        "I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.",
        "Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?",
        "These are from Halloween three years ago.",
        "No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.",
        "Actually, what I think you said was, \"don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen.\"",
        "Hey, Mon, you want some help?",
        "She's still with you?",
        "God!",
        "Oh! What's new in s*x?",
        "Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?",
        "You want me to talk you out of it?",
        "Then what? What do you want?",
        "Why on earth would I understand this?",
        "Oh.",
        "Hey, Mom? Having fun?",
        "There's more alcohol, right?",
        "I had a wedding.",
        "Ok.",
        "What's up?",
        "But what about Phoebe?",
        "Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.",
        "Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?",
        "Honey, I'm sorry.",
        "Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying \"Terry's a jerk!\" That's where that came from.",
        "Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look, look. Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything.< br>\nTERRY: I, I don't know. ",
        "Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine.",
        "Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will cleeeean it.",
        "Done.",
        "Yeah. Who's workin' for you babe?",
        "What?",
        "Oh, no, no no. I meant that he's gonna be paying that other woman beause she's a professional.",
        "Well, but Pheebs.",
        "Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--",
        "Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer.",
        "Hey.",
        "Here. I thought you might be cold.",
        "Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.",
        "Do you?",
        "Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!",
        "Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for \"Smelly Cat\".",
        "Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.",
        "Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying. This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing [a pigeon flies in the window and lands on the table] OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go. [hangs up] OK, that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gonna get a pot, it's not for you. [grabs a pot and lid] OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle comedy. [puts pot over the pigeon] Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, aaaaahh. [knock at the door] It's open you guys.",
        "Hi, hi can I help you?",
        "Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.",
        "What? [in surprise she forgets she has the pigeon in the pot and lets it get away]",
        "What!",
        "Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?",
        "[to Monica at the counter] Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.",
        "Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.",
        "Bye-bye Julie. [Julie leaves]",
        "Hey.",
        "Hey, c'mon, cut it out.",
        "What?",
        "Sure.",
        "What? C'mon, talk to me.",
        "Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having s*x?",
        "Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?",
        "No, no no no, don't need to know the details.",
        "No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think?",
        "I think it's sexy.",
        "Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have s*x.",
        "Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?",
        "I'd wait.",
        "Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more.",
        "Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have s*x with, with another man. That just means it's working.",
        "More than jewelry. [Rachel struts off, extremely pleased with herself]",
        "Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?",
        "What did, what did he say?",
        "Great, people having s*x, that's just what I need to see.",
        "Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.",
        "No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.",
        "Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?",
        "Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna hear everything.",
        "So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?",
        "OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?",
        "Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.",
        "Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?",
        "What?",
        "So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on. . .",
        "Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous?",
        "Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce?",
        "Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.",
        "Maybe you should put it off.",
        "I know, yeah, sorry.",
        "Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that.",
        "Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen.",
        "And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.",
        "Ohh, God.",
        "Hey.",
        "Uhh, the mailman, the super.",
        "What?",
        "Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.",
        "Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?",
        "Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.",
        "How have you never been on Oprah?",
        "Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.",
        "No, nothin'.",
        "Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent. [hands her a smashed box]",
        "Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . .",
        "OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair.",
        "Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross. [she walks off and Ross puts his hand to his hair]",
        "Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.",
        "Did you just break the radiator?",
        "I'll call the super.",
        "[on phone] Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes, somebody, uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here. Yes, it's, it's hot enough to bake cookies. Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6? Wha t, no, no, Tuesday, we can't wait until Tuesday, we're having a party tonight.",
        "[answers door] Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party. You can put your coats and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom.",

        "Nice seizing. . . gel boy.",
        "Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil.",
        "Huh-hoo, yeah, no, it's still basil.",
        "Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.",
        "(sarcastically) Hi, Julie.",
        "Yeah, whoosh!",
        "So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?",
        "Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?",
        "For Ross, Ross, Ross.",
        "Hey.",
        "What?",
        "Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet.",
        "Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.",
        "Ok, I will have the uh, (whispers) side salad.",
        "Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?",
        "Um, everyone?",
        "Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into this right now. I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable.",
        "That's 'cause you have it.",
        "Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.",
        "Ok.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.",
        "Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.",
        "Me neither.",
        "What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?",
        "Fine.",
        "Happy birthday.",
        "Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?",
        "Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?",
        "On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?",
        "What party?",
        "Who gave you that hickey?",
        "Oh!",
        "What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?",
        "Oh!",
        "Hi.",
        "Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see.",
        "What, what incident?",
        "What?",
        "What are you, what are you doin'?",
        "What?",
        "Saving, saving, saving me from the pleasant conversation with the interesting man, saving me?",
        "OK, Ross, listen to me, I am not yours to save.",
        "What?",
        "OK, you know what, are, are you being like, the blind date guy again?",
        "Ross, there is no us, OK.",
        "No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not worth it.",
        "NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that.",
        "No, no, ACC-cept that.",
        "[comes up from behind the bar and startles Chandler] Hey. I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found? [holds up Chandler's bracelet]",
        "Hi.",
        "Oh my God.",
        "They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum.",
        "Oh.",
        "Ahh, so do you, beautiful. [they hug]",
        "What?",
        "Oh, that's OK, it's just the shoulder, it's not my dress.",
        "Oh, thanks. So, uh, what are you gonna do this summer?",
        "[the shoulders of her dress keep falling off her shoulders] Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down, I can't. . .",
        "Oh, the guys are here.",
        "Oh my God, look there's Roy Gublik.",
        "Where's Chip, why isn't he here yet?",
        "I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.",
        "I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh.",
        "Hi you guys.",
        "Hey you.",
        "So, uh, how was your day?",
        "Really? Mine too.",

        "God, oh God Monica, I forgot. This is our first date.",
        "Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. See Phoebe, Phoebe.",
        "C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I'm just saying, you know, it was a little. . . hard to follow.",
        "I know, I just didn't want to wear my glasses on my first date.",
        "Monica.",
        "Honey, I'm just checking.",
        "Monica.",
        "Monica.",
        "I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry, it's just that when you moved your hands down to my butt, it was like woah, Ross's hands are on my butt. Sorry.",
        "Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing.",
        "OK. [start kissing again and Rachel starts lauging again]",
        "I know, I know, I know, I know. I was just thinking about when they were there the last time, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, OK, look, woah, I promise, I'm good, I'm not gonna laugh anymore. OK put your hands back there.",
        "Just one cheek.",
        "Alright, just put your hands out and I'll back up into them.",
        "C'mon touch it.",
        "Oh, come on squeeze it.",
        "Rub it.",

        "Ya know, Dr. Burke kissed me once.",
        "When I was um, 7, I crashed my bike right out in front of his house and to stop me from crying he kissed me right here. [points to the tip of her nose]",
        "I know.",
        "It's OK, it's fine.",
        "Oh.",
        "Yeah well, you know what, so is uh, Sorentino's.",

        "OK, that's dead right?",
        "What is this? What are we doing?",
        "Grape.",
        "Oh, God.",
        "Ah, so what are we looking at?",
        "Really?",
        "Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight. [they kiss]",
        "This time it's not so funny.",
        "Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.",
        "Oh, thank God.",
        "Hi you. I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.",

        "Hey, nice toilet.",
        "OK, here we go. Honey, I'm sorry, they were all out of apple pie, someone just got the last piece.",
        "Oh God. Ross, OK, if you care about me at all, you will get the pie out of the man's hood.",
        "Pie in the hood, pie in the hood. Go.",
        "What's goin' on?",
        "Well, you're not sixteen, you're both adults now.",
        "Or ya know, he's rubber and you're glue.",
        "[sarcastically] I've never wanted you more.",
        "Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too.",
        "It'll never last, he's just a rebound roommate.",
        "Pretty uhm, different huh?",
        "Would you guys stop.",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Now I'm mommy in this little play? Alright look, I refuse to get sucked into this like, weird little Geller dimension thing OK. So I'm gonna go and take a nice long hot bubble bath because you kids are driving me crazy. [goes in the bathroom]",

        "[sings] And you're no friend to those with noses.",
        "[enters from her room] OK, ready when you are.",
        "Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.",
        "Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?",
        "Well I. . .",
        "[reluctantly] Uh-huh.",

        "Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea.",
        "Really? You don't say, because mine was licked on by kittens.",
        "Oh.",
        "Is Ross here?",
        "Oh really, OK. [shows Monica her tattoo]",
        "What? You didn't get one.",
        "That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it.",
        "Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo. [she bends over and bears her tattoo right when Ross returns]",
        "Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world.",
        "Well?",
        "Really?",
        "I guess.",
        "Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?",
        "So what happens next?",
        "Great set tonight Phoebs.",
        "Phoebe's dead.",
        "Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.",
        "Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.",
        "Uhhhooo.",
        "Well, there's you.",
        "Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo.",
        "Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.",
        "Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal s*x. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.",
        "Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.",
        "God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...",
        "Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo.",
        "But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had.",
        "Oh, hi.",
        "Oh my God, honey that's great.",
        "Oh they're in the top drawer. Hurry.",
        "Ooooh yeah.",
        "Ok, I, I will do your laundry for one month.",
        "Ok, ok, ok, I will, I will, I, hey, I will clean the apartment for two months.",
        "Agghhh.",
        "Rock-paper-scissors?",
        "Yeesss.",
        "Honey.",
        "Chandler honey, I'm sorry. Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please? [they turn on the TV]",
        "So, he's on the show, he knows what happens.",
        "Oh good.",
        "Joey.",
        "Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you.",
        "Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.",
        "Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us.",
        "Ok honey, you really need a job.",
        "Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?",
        "Hey, how'd the interview go?",
        "So don't do it.",
        "What's the matter with you?",
        "Noo.",
        "Oohhh.",
        "Hi. [Ross turns to Rachel and they hug]",
        "What?",
        "Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the stock market.",
        "We love you, we're here for you.",
        "Ohh, what is in that?",
        "No no, 'cause mayo, that would make it gross.",
        "Run Phoebe run.",
        "Are you kidding me?",
        "Ok, here, I know what we can do. [grabs Joey's sadwich and throws it out the window]",
        "Ok, doggie get the- aahhh. Ok go get the sandwich, get the sandwich doggie. [dog ignores the sandwich] Good doggie get the sandwich, get the...ok, Joey, the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich, what does that say?",
        "What's the matter?",
        "Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.",
        "Time is money my friend?",
        "How did you make $17.",
        "What happened to uh, MEG.?",
        "Hey Phoebs. Oh hey, how's the dog?",
        "Oh, thank God.",
        "Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?",
        "She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.",
        "Why the voice.",
        "What?",
        "For what?",
        "Why, when did you get out of the game?",
        "Oh no.",
        "Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry.",
        "I, I don't have it.",
        "Nobody does honey.",
        "Look at her.",
        "Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left.",
        "You went out with a guy in the Navy?",
        "So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?",
        "Well I've had it.",
        "Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.",
        "You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.",
        "Oh, stop that, stop that right now.",
        "No sorry hon, Monica's orders.",
        "And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you.",
        "So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?",
        "Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.",
        "It was nice to meet you.",
        "So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "Ok.",
        "Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-... Hey sailor.",
        "I'll say.",
        "Well then uh, we better make this night count. [He starts to carry her out.] Oh wait, I forgot to turn off the cappucino machine. [He carries her over to turn it off.] Anchors away. Oh no no, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my pu rse. [He carries her to the counter to pick up her purse.] Oh, you know what. I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.",
        "Agh, it was the graduation from hell.",
        "Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.",
        "My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.",
        "Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner.",
        "Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you.",
        "Now I love you even more.",
        "Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great.",
        "Wow you, you. I had no idea.",
        "No, I knew.",
        "What?",
        "Why.",
        "Daddy.",
        "Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?",
        "I can't believe this is happening.",
        "I do.",
        "Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.",
        "What?",
        "Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while.",
        "Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok.",
        "Well those are very popular frames.",
        "Yeah, like a chimney.",
        "You want me to see a therapist?",
        "Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing.",
        "Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.",
        "This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?",
        "Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.",
        "It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...",
        "Oh ok.",
        "Ok.",
        "Ok, I've got one. [blows out the candles. Somebody calls out 'heads up' and the volleyball lands in the flan] Wow, those things almost never come true.",
        "What?",
        "That's not the end.",
        "Hey Phoebs, whatcha got there?",
        "Hey.",
        "Wow, he must like you the best.",
        "No luck huh?",
        "Oh, yeah sure, Ok. [she takes Ben and holds him at arms length]",
        "Uh, I'm holding Ben.",
        "Ok.",
        "This is how I would hold a football.",
        "Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I haven't been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one.",
        "Really?",
        "What?",
        "You think about stuff like that?",
        "Two, two babies?",
        "Then what's gonna happen?",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.",
        "I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this [hands back Ben] and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot. I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door? [leaves]",
        "[enters] Aghh.",
        "Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.",
        "I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.",
        "Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks.",
        "Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be.",
        "What was the book?",
        "Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.",
        "But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I didn't know that.",
        "Fine, I will.",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "Well I love you too.",
        "Yes it is.",
        "Well you better.",
        "Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter.",
        "Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben? Yes we can, yes we can. [finishes the diaper] There. I did it. I did it. Look at that, oh, stays on and everything. Hi.",
        "I'm sorry, what did you just say? Did you just say hi? Oh my God, Ross, Ross, Ben just said 'Hi'.",
        "Ben just said hi.",
        "Ye-, no, my Uncle Hi.",
        "Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just bring it out in him.",
        "Guess what. Ben just said his first word.",
        "You know, actually it's more like, hi.",
        "Hi.",
        "Hi.",
        "Hi.",
        "Take care.",
        "Did, did he just, did he, did he just say, he said bye. He said bye. You said, you said bye to me. You said bye to me.",
        "Hey. Whe-ell, look at you, finally got that time machine workin' huh?",
        "Hey.",
        "Woah, woah, woah, what book is this?",
        "Men just take out wind?",
        "Wow.",
        "Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit.",
        "Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so.",
        "Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.",
        "NO!",
        "No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?",
        "No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.",
        "Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?",
        "Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry.",
        "You're right, I don't have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit!",
        "Yeah you like totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power.",
        "Ok, ok, ok, moving on, moving on, next question. Ok number 29, have you ever betrayed another goddess for a lightning bearer? Ok, number 30.",
        "Not uh, not to my recollection.",
        "Only 'cause you took up half the circle.",
        "Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.",
        "Here are your cakes.",
        "No, I know, they're from me. Look you guys this is not good. I mean we have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking it from each other.",
        "You know.",
        "Thank you. So are we good?",
        "We're good?",
        "Ok, let me take these cakes back 'cause they're gonna take that out of my paycheck.",
        "Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?",
        "Yeah, right.",
        "I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.",
        "Because I promised Mindy I would.",
        "Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor. And besides you know what I just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.",
        "Nooo!",
        "Wow! What's that like?",
        "Afraid to ask him?",
        "Hey!",
        "Hi.",
        "Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.",
        "God I know, you're right.",
        "Okay, I'll see you after the thing.",
        "Thank you, Okay, Okay. ",
        "Why the hell didn't you tell me!",
        "Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.",
        "Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.",
        "Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.",
        "Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.",
        "Oh, hi!",
        "I know.",
        "Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.",
        "Yeah, I love that story. Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about?",
        "Insane!",
        "What?!",
        "What.",
        "Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?",
        "Oh dear God.",
        "(to Ross) She you in the parking lot.",
        "(after a pause with everyone staring at her, she goes up to the microphone) Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings (da-doom-chesh). See now, tonight, all I\nreally wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity. Well (laughing), I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen. There's nothing really left to say except....(starts singing) \"Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl. With yellow feathers (band joins in), feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there. She would...\"",
        "(singing) \"...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody..\"",
        "At the Copa, Copa Cabana (everyone joins in) The hottest spot north of Havana. At the Copa, Coo-pa Ca-ban-a, music and fashion were always the passion, at the Copa....",
        "Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.",
        "Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.",
        "What song was that, Pheebs?",
        "Hey Mon!",
        "No, it's been three nights in a row.",
        "What?!",
        "Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.",
        "Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute.",
        "Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?",
        "(she leans over and kisses him on the cheek) Honey, I was wondering....",
        "Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?",
        "Hmm.",
        "You remember not having s*x in high school, right?",
        "Well honey, what about you?",
        "I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?",
        "Come on you gotta have one!",
        "Ross, you know what...",
        "...if you tell me, I might do it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oooh!",
        "Really!",
        "Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?",
        "Really! That-that great huh?",
        "Hi you guys!",
        "Mon. Hi!",
        "Why aren't you at work?",
        "Why?",
        "You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.",
        "Hi.",
        "What?",
        "Oh, really, let me see, let me see.",
        "Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.",
        "Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?",
        "Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.",
        "Were both of those Joey?",
        "Not even with your best friend.",
        "That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.",
        "Pretty much.",
        "Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.",
        "Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What?",
        "Noo way, Kevin.",
        "Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with\n        his doll? (uses the Milk Master 2000 to pour milk into her\n        cereal)",
        "What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?",
        "Men are unbelievable.",
        "Amazingly, that makes sense.",
        "Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies\n        and pretend agents.",
        "Very nice touch.",
        "Unbelievable.",
        "Honey, this will help. (hands him a tub of ice cream)",
        "Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's\n        not so bad. How did you leave it?",
        "Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We\n        sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal\n        cases.",
        "Yeah, you do.",
        "This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself\n        reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get\n        your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to\n        start acting aloof.",
        "Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally\n        run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.",
        "Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.",
        "Oh.",
        "G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?",
        "Yeah, it is.",
        "Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yes, and grumpy.",
        "He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with\n        somebody else by now.",
        "What?!!",
        "Excuse me, there was no time!",
        "Does anybody need more coffee?",
        "(sitting at a table with some of her friends) (to waitress) Oh, um, no, no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I don’t think this is.",
        "That’s all right. (to her friends) I mean hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh?",
        "Ummm, I think it’s time to see the ring again. (holds her hand out and they all scream)",
        "Yeah, I know.",
        "Oh, I don’t know. Well maybe it’s just the idea of Barry for the rest of my life. I don’t know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling, y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system. (Chandler is listening in very intensely)",
        "I’m serious, I really, I think I need just to have some...meaningless, s*x y'know, with the next guy that I see.",
        "Yeah, so?",
        "Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think? (shows her, her ring)",
        "Yes, his name is Barry, he’s a doctor, thank you very much.",
        "Thank you. So how-how ‘bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?",
        "Oh, but that’s okay.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. (points at Chandler, who holds up the cue ball as a ‘Remember me?’ thing) Listen, can we please have lunch the next time I’m in the city?",
        "Okay!",
        "Bye!",
        "Don’t say anything. I don’t wanna speak, I don’t wanna think. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.",
        "What?",
        "Oh, sorry.",
        "Um, (shyly) Barry.",
        "(joining Phoebe outside) Hey Pheebs.",
        "Any sign of your brother?",
        "I thought you only met him once?",
        "Well relax, he’ll be here.",
        "Well, actually Gunther sent me. You’re not allowed to have cups out here, it’s a thing. (takes her cup and goes back inside)",
        "Now, you do realize that she’s a cartoon, and way out of your league?",
        "Oh, I don’t know, I guess, Chris O’Donnel, John F. Kennedy, Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson.",
        "Hardy Boy.",
        "What about you honey, who would be on your list?",
        "Hi!",
        "Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?",
        "Three of your five, what?",
        "Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.",
        "So?",
        "Yeah, ‘cause that’s why you won’t get Isabella Rosselini, geography.",
        "Well, it’s about time.",
        "All right let me see. (grabs the card) Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel?",
        "Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice.",
        "Oh!",
        "Come on!",
        "Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? (the guy nods) Okay, great. (she starts to walk away and under her breath) You freak.",
        "Oh-oh, you lie.",
        "Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.",
        "You know what honey, you go ahead, we’ll call her an alternate.",
        "Okay.",
        "Honey, he’s about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I’m just sorry we don’t got popcorn.",
        "I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he’s Alan Alda.",
        "‘Okay. (listens) Okay, daddy we’ll see you tomorrow night. (listens) Okay bye-bye.’ (hangs up)",
        "Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that’s okay.",
        "Ross, my father doesn’t hate you.",
        "But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do. (Ross looks at her) All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I’ll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Hi Daddy!",
        "You remember Ross.",
        "Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.",
        "Okay.",
        "Aw honey stop! It’s not that bad.",
        "Yeah. That’s Daddy.",
        "Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I’d be serving him sneezers.",
        "So. Ross, I’ve bugged him about this a million times, he’s not gonna change.",
        "Well um, I don’t.",
        "Yeah it is, it is. (to Ross) We really, really have to do something about that.",
        "Oh Daddy, no he didn’t mean anything by that, he really didn’t.",
        "You had to do it, didn’t you? You couldn’t just leave it alone.",
        "Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. (Ross groans and rubs his neck) Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.",
        "Um. yeah.",
        "All right, look, here’s the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I’ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.",
        "Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that’s why you have got to be the bigger man here.",
        "Okay, well can’t you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?",
        "Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don’t wanna have to have a separate room for you too!! (starts to cry)",
        "(opening the door) Hi Daddy.",
        "What? What? He’s interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here.",
        "What?!",
        "He’s got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...",
        "Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.",
        "Well that’s his last name.",
        "It’s Robert Bobby.",
        "And um, excuse me, he helps me.",
        "With my alignment. I’ve got one leg shorter than the other.",
        "What? It’s true, my right leg is two inches shorter.",
        "I’m sorry, let her?",
        "No.",
        "Yeah honey, I’m standing right there! Why didn’t you just tell him about the mole I haven’t got checked yet.",
        "What?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?",
        "(to Chandler) Eh, do you believe that?",
        "I’m gonna get back to retraining. (gets up)",
        "Gunther, Gunther, please, I’ve worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there. (points to the counter.)",
        "Huh. Well, y'know that’s actually a really good idea, because that way they’ll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.",
        "Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I’m, I’m sorry. (walks away)",
        "(sitting down next to Chandler) I’m training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.",
        "Well, yeah! I’m still pursuing that.",
        "Well, I’m also sending out.... good thoughts.",
        "The fear?",
        "Well then how come you’re still at a job that you hate, I mean why don’t you quit and get ‘the fear’?",
        "I don’t know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don’t want to be 30 and still work here.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Can’t I just look at the handles on them?",
        "Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I’m a terrible waitress? Because, I don’t care. I don’t care. I don’t care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don’t care where the tray spot is, I just don’t care, this is not what I want to do. So I don’t think I should do it anymore. I’m gonna give you my weeks notice.",
        "Gunther, I quit.",
        "(entering) Okay, stop what you’re doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....",
        "Hey-hey-hey that’s funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!",
        "I don’t know, I don’t know, weren’t you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!",
        "No, it’s not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don’t have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I’m just gonna, I’m just gonna call Gunther and I’m gonna tell him, I’m not quitting.",
        "You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....",
        "No.",
        "Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Oh, I blew it. I wouldn’t of even hired me.",
        "I can’t! It’s too late! Terry already hired that girl over there. (points to her) Look at her, she’s even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... (starts to cry) swans.",
        "(answering the phone) Hello? (listens) Yeah, this is she. (listens) Oh! You’re kidding! You’re kidding! (listens) Oh thank you! I love you!",
        "(hanging up the phone) I got the job!",
        "Here we go. I’m serving my last cup of coffee. (the gang starts humming the graduation theme) There you go. (hands it to Chandler) Enjoy. (they all cheer)",
        "Um, excuse me, everyone. Ah, this is my last night working here, and I ah, just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here, and ah, it’s just time to move on. (at the counter Gunther starts to cry and runs into the back room) Ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it feels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again.",
        "No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.",
        "Oh! That would be sooo much fun!",
        "Let’s do it! Ross?",
        "Do you wanna play football?",
        "Um, there was a Geller Cup?",
        "Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.",
        "(knocking it down instead of catching it) That almost hit me in the face.",
        "Monica, I’m your best friend.",
        "Ross!",
        "You don’t pick me! You’re stuck with me!",
        "(coming over to Ross, who is just getting up) Are you okay?",
        "Over here!",
        "(proud of her self) I almost caught that one!",
        "Wait, what am I gonna do?",
        "Wait, how long?",
        "Okay.",
        "Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it’s like all I’m doing is running back and forth from the huddle.",
        "Can I see that for second.",
        "Now, does it really matter?",
        "All right, so are we not having dinner at all?",
        "I went really long.",
        "I can not believe your trading me!!",
        "Are you gonna let me play?",
        "Yeah!!! Kill ‘um!!!",
        "No! Come on! Don’t make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.",
        "God, I’m not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.",
        "Thank you! Break!",
        "I’m so sorry! Are you okay?",
        "I’m sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn’t know what to do.",
        "(on the verge of tears) Okay.",
        "(in triumph) I got a touchdown! We did it!!",
        "We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there’s a like league we could join or something.",
        "Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.",
        "Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special\n        homemade brownies? ",
        "Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!",
        "And all these people actually died?",
        "Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just\n        go.",
        "I promise.",
        "Joey, you can’t keep this to yourself, if you know about this,\n        you have to tell him.",
        "Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?",
        "(holding Ben) Look Benny, spoon. (moves it back and\n        forth) Spoon. Come on! All right, y'know what I think he’s bored.",
        "Okay. Okay honey, he’s fine, he’s fine, let’s just put him\n        down. Come here, Ben. (sets him on the couch) See that’s a good\n        boy. (to Monica) How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me,\n        what is he going to say?!",
        "We’re not?!",
        "All right, I like that. ",
        "So we’re okay, we’re okay, we’re okay, (starts to exam\n        Ben) aren’t we? No, we’re not okay, we’re not okay, there’s a\n        bump, there’s a bump.",
        "I cannot push it in!",
        "Okay, okay, okay.",
        "Okay.",
        "Or. We could put a hat on his head.",
        "We need a hat..",
        "Oh, oh, oh, I’ll get ‘Rainy Day Bear’!! (runs to get him)",
        "Oh God, oh God, it’s sowed on though.",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh!!",
        "Oh, it’s just like a bloodbath in here today.",
        "Right.",
        "See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn’t I?",
        "Okay, I heard that.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "(goes over and hits her head on the post) Look at that!\n        (repeats) Look at that! (repeats) We all do it. (repeats) Okay,\n        I’m stopping now.",
        "Oh yeah! Y'know, if it’s not a headboard, it’s just not worth\n        it.",
        "Monica, number one, I don’t think Ben understands the\n        concept of bribery, and number two, I... (Joey starts laughing\n        in the background) (to Joey) What?!",
        "I also said number one.",
        "Hi!",
        "He’s perfect, he’s never been better.",
        "Well maybe he’s just taking a nap.",
        "Well, we have gotta find out if he’s alive.",
        "Are you, are you, are you sure it’s ah, a new bump? I mean,\n        no offense, I’ve always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed\n        child.",
        "(confidently) I did!",
        "I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his\n        head against that thing!",
        "I hope it’s still funny when you’re in hell.",
        "I’ll get the hat.",
        "Hey-hey, now he’s showing us his poking device.",
        "Wow.",
        "Noo, that’s our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.",
        "Good luck.",
        "(jumping up from reading her magazine) Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.",
        "I know!",
        "Op.",
        "Oh, you got me.",
        "Oh, that sounds great.",
        "Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.",
        "Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.",
        "Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it’s remotely related to the field they’re interested in.",
        "Oh honey, come on, I’m sorry, I didn’t.... I don’t mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.",
        "(to him) Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?",
        "It’s not funny, this is actually my job.",
        "Oh well then, so I’m just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.",
        "Yes?!",
        "(looks at Monica) (to him) Do you want my pickle?",
        "(entering, to Ross) The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.",
        "Hi! So I’m out having lunch at Monica’s and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale’s and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he’s gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!",
        "I know!",
        "Uh-huh!",
        "Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.",
        "What!?",
        "To be nice.",
        "I didn’t have to, because I was wearing my ‘I heart Ross’ sandwich board and ringing my bell.",
        "Well, I assume I’ll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that’s true of any job.",
        "I mean that’s unbelievable.",
        "Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.",
        "That’s all right.",
        "Hey. (they all walk away from Chandler)",
        "Did he call? Did Mark call?",
        "Oh. (we hear laughing from the upstairs apartment) Oh my God, is that Phoebe?",
        "Music. Very nice.",
        "So, how are you?",
        "Oh yeah, what’s it about?",
        "Yeah, I do. (they both run out)",
        "I can’t believe Mark didn’t call. It’s Sunday night, and he didn’t call.",
        "(to Ross) Yeah, right. Look at you, you’re practically giddy.",
        "Yeah, and you don’t mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.",
        "(on phone) Hello, Mark? Hi, it’s Rachel Green. (listens) Oh no, don’t you apologize. (listens) Yeah, I’ll hold. (to Monica and Ross) He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.",
        "(on phone) Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it’s perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! (hangs up phone) I got the interview!",
        "He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.",
        "I got to figure out what I’m going to wear.",
        "Yeah! Right! Okay, I’ll see you guys later. (starts to leave) Woo hoo!",
        "(getting of the elevator and noticing Ross) Hey!",
        "What are you doing here?",
        "Oh.",
        "Hi.",
        "Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn’t shut up.",
        "Me too!",
        "I know.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah. (turns around) Hi Mark!",
        "Oh, I did!",
        "(to Ross) Oh my God!! (she turns around and hugs Mark, not Ross)",
        "Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.",
        "Honey, I’m sorry.",
        "(running in from her bedroom, wearing only a towel) Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?",
        "(to Ross) Tell him.",
        "(running into the living room) Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.",
        "No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.",
        "Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.",
        "Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. (to Phoebe) Is this actually a lunchbox?",
        "Oh.",
        "Yeah. What kind of discount do we get?",
        "Oh!! I love this job! (her phone rings) Wow! My first call.",
        "Hi honey!",
        "Oh, he's just goofing around.",
        "Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants.",
        "Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?",
        "I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go. (to Mark) Mark, I need you!",
        "Ow! Ross!!",
        "Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm... (she picks up this bug and it starts to play the theme from Love Story)",
        "Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's just really romantic.",
        "Yes.",
        "All right Ross!! I get it!!",
        "You're hurt!",
        "Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!",
        "Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do.",
        "Ohhh! That is soo sweet! (gets up to get herself a cup of coffee)",
        "(now standing behind Ross) Ross!",
        "So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?",
        "Right.",
        "Hello.",
        "A big idiot.",
        "Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?",
        "Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous. (she kisses him)",
        "Where ya going?",
        "Ohh, with who?",
        "There was a woman at the... (realizes) The stripper?!",
        "You have a play date with a stripper?!",
        "Sure, is she married?",
        "Oh. (starts shaking the sugar down in a packet really hard.)",
        "Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?",
        "I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I...",
        "Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.",
        "(to Chandler) Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.",
        "(looking at her watch) Oh my God, I gotta go to work!",
        "Oh I don’t know honey. It’s gonna be really late.",
        "I know. I’m sorry. Look, I’ll make a deal with you all right? Okay?",
        "For every night that you’re asleep before I get home from work...",
        "I will wake you up in a way that’s proved very popular in the past.",
        "Right.",
        "Somebody got in late last night.",
        "When did this happen?",
        "Monica, what are you doing?",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "Do you have any ice?",
        "Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?",
        "Hmm. (she opens the freezer) Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?",
        "But ah, you’re safe from it if it’s in the freezer?",
        "How often do you read it?",
        "Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that’s a classic, what’s so great about The Shining?",
        "Okay. Ah, well we’ll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, (she tries to take the book away from him but he doesn’t want to let it go) and you will read Little Women.",
        "All right.",
        "Okay.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, Danny just went into room 217.",
        "Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you’re gonna ruin it!",
        "Joey! I can’t believe you just did that!",
        "All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she’s still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.",
        "Eh. Beth dies.",
        "Um-hmm.",
        "What?!",
        "No. She doesn’t die.",
        "Because, I wanted to hurt you.",
        "(gasps) Oh my....",
        "(screams and grabs a potato masher to defend herself) Sorry. I’m sorry.",
        "I’m sorry, I was just thinking you’re day could still pick up.",
        "What?",
        "Awwww.",
        "Joey?",
        "Do you want to put the book in the freezer?",
        "Okay.",
        "Hi, sweetie!",
        "I’ve got some bad news.",
        "I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.",
        "Nooo, he’s leaving for a better job.",
        "Well we’re gonna miss you around here.",
        "Yeah, you bet.",
        "Funny book?",
        "Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn’t mind.",
        "Oh, please tell me it’s not because I’m going with Mark.",
        "Oh my God!!! Ross!!",
        "Because, he’s my friend.",
        "Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?",
        "I don’t know, you thought ‘See you Saturday’ was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.",
        "Really!?",
        "Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. (Ross has a worried look on his face) What?",
        "Oh. (puts her hand over his mouth)",
        "Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father’s boat didn’t make that much noise when it hit rocks!",
        "Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he’s ‘Hey everybody! Remember that thing that’s been dead for a gazillion years. Well there’s this little bone we didn’t know it had!’",
        "Okay, see now, what I just heard: blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.",
        "Oh, that is so...",
        "Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn’t go with Mark?",
        "It’s not dumb. But, maybe it’s okay that you’re not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? (Ross looks confused) I mean it’s like, I-I-I like that you’re not involved in that part of my life.",
        "Honey see, it doesn’t mean that I don’t love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it’s-it’s for me y'know, I’m out there, on my own, and I’m doing it and it’s scary but I love it, because it’s mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?",
        "What?!!",
        "(answering her phone at work) Hello.",
        "Oh, hi.",
        "Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I’ve got to get this order in. Honey, I’m so sorry, but it looks like I’m gonna be here all night.",
        "No-no-no, no, honey please, I’ve got, I’ve just have so much to deal with.",
        "(on the phone) No, no, no, I’m looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And.... (listens) What does it matter, what I’m wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor? (listens) Thank you. (to Sophie) We’re holding.",
        "(startled) Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?",
        "Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.",
        "Honey, honey, I’m sorry, I know it’s our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don’t have time to stop.",
        "But I don’t, hmm... (on phone) Oh, who approved that order?! (listens) Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office. (to Sophie) Get me Mark on the phone!",
        "Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is not the number for (Ross starts making a lot of noise with a handheld pepper grinder) this store, 038 is Atlanta. And I...(stops and looks at Ross)",
        "(angrily) None for me.",
        "I’m sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I’m sorry but that’s... (notices a fire that Ross’s candle has started) Oh my God!!",
        "(on phone) Excuse me, I’m sorry, I’m gonna have to call you back, I’ve got a Schemp in my office. (hangs up) (to Ross) What are you doing?",
        "Ross you’re not listening to me, I don’t have time to stop.",
        "I don’t have ten minutes!!",
        "Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don’t!",
        "Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I’ve got a deadline, would you just go home, I’ll talk to you later. (storms out)",
        "Good bye!",
        "Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...",
        "(throws her stuff down) I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.",
        "You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody’s work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!",
        "But I told you, I didn’t have the time!",
        "Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?",
        "Just a job!",
        "Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I’m doing something that I’m actually good at. I mean. if you don’t get that...",
        "Well neither do I!",
        "(shocked) Oh my God.",
        "Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you’re, you’re, you’re making this too hard.",
        "I don’t know, I don’t know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.",
        "No. (Ross is standing in the doorway.) A break from us.",
        "(jumping up to answer the phone) Hello!",
        "(disappointed) Oh.",
        "No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!",
        "Yeah. Well, umm.....",
        "(on the verge of tears) Yeah, I’m fine.",
        "No! Really, no, please, please, that’s, that’s okay.",
        "Oh, yeah, I’m not, I’m not hungry.",
        "Oh. Okay, bye.",
        "Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don’t want to take a break.",
        "No. (grabs an eggroll) And then I called him, and he wasn’t there.",
        "Oh, thank you that’s very helpful, I’m glad you came over.",
        "Hello.",
        "Hi! Oh, I’m so glad you called.",
        "Nobody.",
        "Umm, honey, look he just came over to....",
        "(picks up the phone and calls Ross) Oh, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, you’re not home.",
        "You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you’ve got a girlfriend?",
        "(shocked) Oh my God.",
        "Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.",
        "No. A break from us.",
        "Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don’t want to take a break.",
        "Nobody.",
        "Umm, honey, look he just came over to....",
        "Hey.",
        "Well, we never actually got to dinner.",
        "No, we kinda broke up instead.",
        "(looking up at the ceiling) God, Monica it’s on the ceiling.",
        "Yeah, but it’s okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.",
        "No.",
        "No, no-no, it’s okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work.",
        "(on answering machine) Hi, it’s me. I’ve been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.",
        "Eh, I’m just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I don’t want to get back together over a machine.",
        "So, I love you.",
        "And y'know what, I’m gonna, I’m gonna go to bed now, but ah, on my way to work tomorrow morning, I’m gonna stop by around 8:30.",
        "Bye.",
        "Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.",
        "So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?",
        "I can’t talk to you. I can’t even look at you right now!",
        "Just get away from me!",
        "A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!",
        "Ross, you had s*x with another woman!",
        "(opening the door) Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!",
        "Just get out! Now!!",
        "Okay! All right! How was she?",
        "Was she good?",
        "Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let’s talk about it!! How was she?",
        "Good different?",
        "Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? (Ross can’t answer that) Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!",
        "And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!",
        "We were on a break!",
        "You think you’re gonna get out of this on a technicality?",
        "Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!",
        "God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!",
        "Oh, that is so sweet. I think I’m falling in love with you all over again.",
        "All right. Let’s say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?",
        "You’d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?",
        "You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....",
        "I’m thinking, I’m gonna order a pizza.",
        "Fine. (on phone) Hi! Yes, I’d like to order a large pizza.",
        "With ah, extra anchovies.",
        "Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?",
        "Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.",
        "That’s....",
        "That is neither here nor there.",
        "No Ross!! (stands up and moves away from him) Don’t! You can’t just kiss me and think you’re gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn’t work that way. It doesn’t just make it better. Okay?",
        "(softly) I think you should go.",
        "(softly) I really think you need to go now.",
        "Yeah, what the hell did I know!",
        "(crying) No. I can’t, you’re a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can’t stop picturing with her, I can’t, (Ross stands up and backs away) it doesn’t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It’s just changed, everything. Forever.",
        "Then how come it is?",
        "Hey!",
        "Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.",
        "Closer than here?",
        "Wait, I’m not just gonna drink somebody’s old coffee.",
        "(softly) Is he here?",
        "Oh. (smiles) Here’s your moisturiser. Hi!",
        "You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. (they’re all silent and look away) Okay, I said that out loud right?",
        "Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.",
        "Hm-mm.",
        "Ohh!",
        "Oh, it’s okay. (starts to leave)",
        "And heels.",
        "No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that’s only fair. (leaves)",
        "Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I’m asking you first, right?!. I mean I’m playing by the rules.",
        "Chandler! You’re smoking? What are you doing?!",
        "Okay.",
        "No. Thank you.",
        "Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is ‘no tissue, no tuschy.’ (Phoebe laughs and gets out.) Well, if everybody’s going. (She gets out and starts to close the door.)",
        "What?!",
        "What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra.",
        "No, I stuff outside the bra.",
        "(seeing him) Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.",
        "What, what’s it, what’s going on?",
        "So you know how to fix it?",
        "Great!",
        "Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.",
        "I don’t know, I’m sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.",
        "Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.",
        "No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!",
        "No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you’ll have to think of something else.",
        "(all excited) Op, op, car! Car!! (sees it’s Ross) Ugh!!!",
        "What is he doing here?!",
        "All right!! Fine! Fine.",
        "Ask me what?",
        "You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.",
        "Why would you even want to come Ross? You’re a horrible skier.",
        "All right, let’s go!",
        "Oh, I’m sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?",
        "Y'know Ross why don’t you put that on your answering machine!",
        "(to Monica) What?!",
        "Really Joey?",
        "No, I think it’s very obvious who’s wrong here.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Hey, Sophie!",
        "Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn’t have to walk me all the way back up here.",
        "Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don’t keep the women’s lingerie here in the office?",
        "Summer catalogue! (hands him the catalogue)",
        "(introduces them) Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing (to Chandler) Joanna.",
        "Bye, Chandler.",
        "Oh, nothing, he’s just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore.",
        "No!! No! He’s not married, or involved, with anyone!",
        "Well, I’ll ask him for you, if you want me too?",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "I need to talk to you!",
        "Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.",
        "Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...",
        "(looks at him) That was (pause) surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?",
        "Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she’s gonna love me.",
        "Wow!!",
        "What’s this?",
        "All right!",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Ooohhhh!!",
        "Ahhhh!!",
        "(to Chandler) O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.",
        "Hmm.",
        "What?!",
        "Oh, I....",
        "Oh, I know...",
        "Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you’re going to call her?",
        "You can’t just say, ‘Nice to meet you, good night?’",
        "Well, they always called.",
        "No. Sorry.",
        "Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.",
        "Well...",
        "No. I...",
        "(grabbing the magazine out of his hands) Call her! Call her now!",
        "Why hasn’t he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don’t understand. Why? He said he’ll call. Why? Why? Chandler I’m telling you she has flipped out, she’s gone crazy!",
        "Come on, this isn’t funny. She thinks it’s my fault that you haven’t called her. You have to call her!",
        "Well then you’re going to have to take her out again.",
        "I don’t care! I don’t care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it’s actually ended. And, I don’t care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!",
        "That’s fine!",
        "I know.",
        "Sophie’s desk.",
        "(whispering) Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!",
        "Chandler!!",
        "Okay, you are going to tell her and you’re going to tell her now. (She grabs his nipple and starts to twist it.)",
        "Well, I’m really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit. (hands him an audio cassette)",
        "Come on, it’s a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn’t smoked since.",
        "(to Ross) What’s your problem?",
        "Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.",
        "Oh right, ‘cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.",
        "Oh, y'know what, I didn’t want cinnamon on this.",
        "Oh my God!! Great!",
        "Well, that shouldn’t be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.",
        "(laughs) Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain’t a pretty picture in the morning, y’know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.",
        "I think you should definitely go out with this guy.",
        "Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker: Texas Ranger?",
        "All right.",
        "Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Thank you.",
        "Hey Mon, let’s give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.",
        "We use it!!",
        "Oh my God, Monica’s gonna go out with a millionaire.",
        "Oh my God, I can’t believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.",
        "Oh yeah, sure, that too.",
        "Oh my God! The millionaire’s here!",
        "Hi!!",
        "Just one drink?!",
        "Thank you.",
        "Hi! All right, let’s go shoppin’!!",
        "Oh, okay.",
        "Wow! Umm....",
        "I know.",
        "Well, I told him I would think about it, but I’m gonna tell him no.",
        "I mean I think I’d say no to anybody right now. (Hearing this Gunther swoops back to cleaning tables.) Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I’m standing there with this charming, cute guy, who’s asking me to go out with him, which I’m allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I’d be cheating on Ross or something.",
        "I don’t have any issues with my Father.",
        "Hi!",
        "Yeah. Ahh, here’s a box of your stuff. (hands him a box)",
        "Oh, y'know, it’s just like hats, and a shirt, and CD’s, just sort of stuff that you’ve left here.",
        "No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it’s time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don’t’ you think?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Good.",
        "Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.",
        "Okay, all right, give me the mug! I’ll keep the mug.",
        "You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!",
        "Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....",
        "Petty... (goes into her room)",
        "Petty...",
        "Small...",
        "You are so just doing this out of spite.",
        "Huh?",
        "You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn’t even fit you anymore!",
        "(imitating him) yeah-yeah-yeah!!",
        "Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, ‘Where’s number 27?!’",
        "Y'know what?",
        "I can’t do this.",
        "Well, oh, Mark, I’m doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I’m just doing it to get back at Ross. I’m sorry, it’s not very fair to you.",
        "Oh God. I’m sorry about this.",
        "You sure?",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn’t a chair.",
        "Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I’m just gonna throw it out, it’s probably just a bunch of shampoo and... (she opens the box and stops)",
        "(She takes the T-shirt out of the box and holds it to her chest and take a deep breath.) No. Nothing. (She smiles and goes into her room.)",
        "So who’s idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?",
        "What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?",
        "And you’re still not attracted to him at all?",
        "Yeah, but Mon that’s totally different. He was you’re health\n        teacher.",
        "Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me\n        yesterday.",
        "I know. ",
        "Ow!!",
        "(looking at the outfit) Got a job on a river boat?",
        "Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.",
        "Now that you’re on you’re own, you’re free to look as stupid\n        as you like.",
        "Yeah, come here!",
        "Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!",
        "(she reaches for the bottle) Oww! (She grabs the bottle, but\n        has trouble opening it. She pops the top off and aspirins fly\n        all over the place as Ross enters.)",
        "(She bends over to try and pick up the aspirin) Oww!",
        "I’m fine, I’m fine.",
        "Yes I am! ",
        "Look, I’m fine. Watch. (She picks up an aspirin between her\n        toes) Look at that. (She lifts her leg to grab the aspirin\n        with her hand and almost falls over.) Whoa-whoa!",
        "No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses\n        house. It’s a very big deal, there’s a lot of people there I\n        have to meet.",
        "Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it’ll still be\n        broken then.",
        "But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready.",
        "Look, either help me or go.",
        "(with a hurt expression on her face) Okay, but before you go,\n        could you help me first?",
        "(She drops the brush) Y'know what? I cannot do this with my\n        left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?",
        "(taking the brush back) Okay. Let’s use this brush. (Hands him\n        another one.)",
        "Yeah.",
        "Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across\n        the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.",
        "Oh-ho!",
        "Hey! That’s just poking me in the eye!",
        "Okay, just sweep it.",
        "Right.",
        "Okay, now make it even, ‘cause we don’t...",
        "We don’t want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.",
        "Since when, since when do you think I don’t wear enough of\n        this?",
        "Blow it.",
        "Sophisticated like a hooker?",
        "Sure.",
        "Sure, I’ll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing.",
        "Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?",
        "Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.",
        "I don’t want you to see me naked!",
        "Yeah, but that was different. Y’know? I mean, we were, we were\n        going out then, now I think it’s weird.",
        "What?",
        "Ross! Stop that!",
        "Come on! I don’t want you thinking of me like that any more!",
        "Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!",
        "Rosss...",
        "All right. (She starts to take off her robe) Fine.",
        "O-kay!! See what you did, I’m gonna be doing it by myself now.\n        Okay? ",
        "That’s it. (She crawls onto the bed) Ow!!! ",
        "Oh-ow!",
        "Ow!",
        "Ow!",
        "Ow!",
        "Ow! Ow!",
        "Okay, I do. ",
        "I really do.",
        "Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you’re not gonna come with me?",
        "Okay.",
        "Thank you. (She goes to take off her make-up and screams in\n        pain) Oww!!!! God!",
        "I’m sorry, I just can’t go to the hospital lookin’ like this.",
        "Okay, you’d tell me the truth. Right?",
        "Okay.",
        "What thing? What thing?",
        "What thing? What is this thing?",
        "Oh my God! ",
        "Ross, why didn’t you tell me that?",
        "I cannot believe you.",
        "That is the sweetest thing, I just....",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh, I’m sorry I spoiled you’re evening.",
        "Um-hmm, yeah.",
        "(After he closes the door) See ya.",
        "How’d it go with Pete?!",
        "So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?",
        "Why?! What is it?",
        "Yes!!",
        "Y'know I don’t, I don’t understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin’ her boob.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, ah with who?",
        "Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?",
        "Oh! (laughs) That’s fine.",
        "(to Phoebe) Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?",
        "This is Bonnie? (to Phoebe) This is Bonnie? (to Bonnie) You’re Bonnie?",
        "Oh no, I’m sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.",
        "Oh, that must be it.",
        "(to Phoebe) You said she was bald.",
        "How could you not tell me that she has hair?",
        "(looks in the window) Ohh, well, this is just perfect!",
        "Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!",
        "Why, does she have a bad personality?",
        "(seeing Ross and Bonnie inside Central Perk) Oh my God! Phoebe look, it’s Ross and that girl.",
        "Phoebe! (goes back to the window)",
        "Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that’s, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that’s what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...",
        "Ohh! (walking away from the window) Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he’s gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.",
        "You said she was bald!!",
        "Phoebe, we can’t, we just can’t just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!",
        "(quietly) Yes.",
        "Yes.",
        "I just y'know, I didn’t expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh! (sits down on the curb)",
        "What?",
        "Oh!",
        "Oh, I can’t watch this. (turns her eyes away)",
        "(entering, interrupting them) Hey guys! What's... (sees what they're doing and stops, the guys are stunned)",
        "Hi!",
        "Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?",
        "Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher.",
        "What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.",
        "Hi!",
        "And?",
        "Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?",
        "So Pheebs, pick one of them.",
        "(entering with Phoebe) This place is amazing.",
        "(standing up) Ahh... Chandler's on the couch!!",
        "Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!",
        "Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, “Look how much money we’ve got!” Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it’ll be dry, but people will like it.",
        "Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!",
        "OH MY GOD!!! (She holds her hands up in triumph and the gang all look at her.) Sorry, I was just imagining what it’d be like to catch the money bouquet.",
        "(entering) Hi! Okay, don’t be mad at me, but I couldn’t resist.",
        "Yes, and I know that you’d say no if he asked you, but I’m sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin. (shows her the picture.)",
        "Oh my God. (starting to cry)",
        "You didn’t break up with that fireman?",
        "Wow!",
        "Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold? I was supposed to call my Dad back like two hours ago.",
        "What’s Flimby’s?",
        "Okay. Hang up! That’s it! Come on!",
        "I had one.",
        "No. No, not at all, not at all. I actually was gonna bring someone myself, so…",
        "I meant, me plus one!",
        "Okay, bye-bye!",
        "Okay, I need a date! (runs to her bedroom)",
        "Oh, hi!",
        "How are you? (She goes to kiss him on the cheek, but stops because of the dates and pats him on the shoulder.)",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah, looks that way. First ones here! Wooo!!",
        "Oh! Tommy, this is Ross. Ross, Tommy.",
        "Okay, uhh, I think I’m going to run to the ladies room.",
        "Oh, hi!",
        "Hey. Gosh, you look soo familiar.",
        "We’re not actors.",
        "Hey!",
        "What time is it?",
        "Tommy’s supposed to be here soon, we’re going to lunch.",
        "You don’t?!",
        "Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.",
        "(not seeing Ross) What’s your favourite thing about summertime?",
        "Yeah…",
        "Tommyyyy! Say, what’s your favourite thing about summer?",
        "Ross, would you just stop it! It’s getting really old.",
        "Phoe-be!!",
        "(to Monica) I mean is that woman capable of talking about\n        anything else but s*x?",
        "That is so cool.",
        "(sarcastic) Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.",
        "(approaching) Hey! ",
        "Ross gave it to me.",
        "Ohh, thank you.",
        "Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell\n        you that hats are back.",
        "Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!",
        "(to Monica) Allll done!",
        "Okay, who’s next?! (She looks around the room, and stops when\n        she comes to Ross.)",
        "Come on, please?! I’m boredddd! You let me do it once before.",
        "Yes! (she starts creeping up on him)",
        "Just once! ",
        "Take it like a man, Ross!",
        "Oh, come on!",
        "Really?!",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "(reading a card) Okay, your band is playing at Arnold’s,\n        collect three cool points. Which means, I have five, and that\n        means I get Joey’s boxers!",
        "(getting up) All right, I’m gonna make more margaritas! (She\n        pours the rest of the pitcher into Ross’s glass.)",
        "I’m just making margaritas.",
        "What?! ",
        "Oh, come on!",
        "Monica, please?",
        "(pause) He is, isn’t he? I don’t know, I don’t know, I mean\n        maybe it’s just being here at the beach together or, I don’t\n        know. But it’s like something... (she’s interrupted by the\n        sound of Bonnie entering)",
        "(entering) Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?!",
        "Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn’t up yet. Did you guys\n        hear them last night?",
        "Oh, great.",
        "I’m going for a walk.",
        "Oh, ah nothin’. I just felt like hangin’ out here and reading.",
        "Ohhhh, sorry I missed that.",
        "Ohh-ha-ha!",
        "Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were\n        bald.",
        "Ohh!",
        "Really?!",
        "I mean you definitely should do that.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!",
        "Aww Pheebs, that sucks!",
        "Hi!",
        "That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge.",
        "Hey!",
        "Come on see, she doesn’t look that bad.",
        "I don’t know.",
        "All right! Ross, do you think it’s easy for me to see you with\n        somebody else?",
        "Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving\n        you!",
        "Noo.",
        "Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!",
        "Noo! Maybe! I, I don’t know. Ross, I still can’t forgive you\n        for what you did, I can’t, I just, but sometimes when I’m with\n        you I just, I feel so...",
        "I just, I feel, I-I just...",
        "I feel...",
        "Well! Good night. (to Ross) I’m going upstairs.",
        "Good! ‘Cause I’ve got a product report to read, it’s like eight pages, I hope I don’t fall asleep.",
        "(sees Chip’s phone number) Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?",
        "(interrupting) I bet he sensed that I was ready to have s*x with another guy.",
        "Okay. (picks up phone) Are you sure you wanna hear this?",
        "(on phone) Chip! Hi, it’s Rachel. (listens) Rachel Green. Yeah, umm, you left me a message. (listens) Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. (listens) Monica Geller. (listens) Ohh.",
        "Why? I love that thing.",
        "Oh no.",
        "Something to do with numbers?",
        "What?",
        "You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!",
        "Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you’re going out with Chip Matthews?",
        "Nooo! It’s not okay! I can’t believe you would want to after what he did to me!",
        "Monica! I couldn’t find him for two hours! He was having s*x with Amy Welch!",
        "I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!",
        "Okay, that doesn’t help me, because we went to the same high school.",
        "(shocked) They had to have that specially made?!",
        "(stunned) Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!",
        "Oh, you go out with him. (goes over and hugs her) ",
        "Yeah. Just, if it’s possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have s*x with another guy?",
        "I believe it.",
        "Yes, I do.",
        "Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.",
        "Jurassic Park could happen.",
        "(entering) You guys, you’re never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! (She’s holding a flyer.) Look kinda familiar?",
        "You guys, there’s a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!",
        "Do we have to tell her?",
        "I hate when Ross is right!",
        "Pheebs...",
        "All right!!",
        "Jeez!",
        "Hello, Chip.",
        "I’m great! I’m great. I’ve got a great job at Bloomingdale’s, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I’m not seeing anyone right now, I’ve never felt better about myself.",
        "She’ll be out in a second. So, Chip, how’s umm, Amy Welch?",
        "Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.",
        "(to Monica) So, how was your date?",
        "Um-hmm.",
        "Oh honey, I’m sorry.",
        "Ohh! That’s so great!",
        "I’m sorry, sweetie. (shows her the flyer)",
        "That’s a good call. Right.",
        "You could.... say you’re sorry to her mom.",
        "So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?",
        "I’ll go with you.",
        "What?",
        "Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.",
        "Well, I thought you liked doing it. (Rachel starts out the door and stops.)",
        "Right!",
        "Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.",
        "Ummm. Oh! I’m sorry. (She grabs the box and offers him a piece.) It’s a little old but…",
        "I’m sorry. I didn’t—I don’t come in here a lot.",
        "No.",
        "I didn’t… I never said that.",
        "(starting to cry) Okay, I’m sorry. (Runs out still carrying the pizza box.)",
        "Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.",
        "That’s easy for you to say, you weren’t almost just killed.",
        "Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?",
        "Oh! My hero! What happened?",
        "What?! You got us evicted!!",
        "That’s not true! (Starts to cry.)",
        "Go!!",
        "Well, why doesn’t he practice with a girl?",
        "Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that…garbage chute. (Starts to cry)",
        "Hey! So, did you quit?",
        "Oh, umm, I was just y’know working out and umm… Oh, that’s it.",
        "Where?!",
        "(laughing) What was that?",
        "You just did a little dancy thing.",
        "You are soo enjoying this.",
        "Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.",
        "What are you ever gonna use that for?!",
        "You got fired?!",
        "Sweety...",
        "Oh! Good thing Chandler’s not here, he always wins at this game.",
        "(entering) Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?",
        "My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must’ve been awkward.",
        "(laughs) You ah, you didn’t say ‘Yes’ to that did you?",
        "What is she doing here?",
        "I don’t understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a ‘big, dull dud.’",
        "Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!",
        "Chandler!! (He turns around quickly) Promise me, you will end it.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Oh yeah, I totally agree.",
        "That’s weird, she locked the door.",
        "Okay, swear you won’t tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna’s office. Do you wanna see the list?",
        "(answering it) (angrily) What?!",
        "You promised you would break up with her!",
        "And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!",
        "Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.",
        "Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! (Grabs the key) You never see Joanna again!",
        "You never come into this office again!",
        "You give me back my Walkman!",
        "Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!",
        "Does it hurt?",
        "Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?",
        "When she sees that you’re gone, she’s gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I’m gonna get fired!",
        "No, there’s nothing to make up, she’s gonna know that I have a key to her office, I’ve got to get you locked up back the way you were! (She tries to drag him over to the chair, but Chandler stops her.)",
        "Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she’s very private about her office. Now I know why.",
        "What if I clean your bathroom for a month?",
        "Foot rubs for a month!",
        "I’ll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!",
        "Sophie sit!!",
        "No! God, would you just calm down!",
        "I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.",
        "I ah… Oh! I’ll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!",
        "(happily) Yeah!!",
        "D’oh!! (pause) I’ve got it!",
        "I have so got it. There’s gonna be rumours about this, there’s no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.",
        "Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous (Holds her hands far apart) or very (In a high pitched voice) stingy.",
        "I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation’s Milton Berle.",
        "Ohh, not compared to you. (Chandler nods in agreement)",
        "So did you break up with Joanna?",
        "What?!",
        "It’s me! Good morning!",
        "Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn’t have poppy seed bagels, so I… (Enters Joanna’s office and sees her handcuffed to her chair wearing nothing but a slip) Oh my word!",
        "Oh, yeah! Yeah!",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh, you’re welcome a million.",
        "(softly) Oh my God.",
        "Whoa! What?! Why?!",
        "Here?! Now?!",
        "Well, can’t you tell her that you are not in the mood?",
        "(interrupting) Whoa-ho.",
        "I don’t know.",
        "Oh, making it worse!",
        "Oh, was it awful?",
        "I wrote you a letter.",
        "(handing him the letter) It’s just some things I’ve been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.",
        "Well, I’ll be waiting for you, just come up when you’re done.",
        "(coming down the stairs) Hey! (Ross jumps up, and quickly puts the letter back together, pretending like he has just finished it.) What happened to you? Why didn’t you come up?",
        "You just finished?",
        "So umm, does it?",
        "Does it?",
        "What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn’t, and if you have to even think about it...",
        "Are you sure?",
        "I know. (Hugs him more violently this time and pushes him back away from the letter.)",
        "How was the beach?",
        "Ooh, I have to go pack. (Gets up to do so.) It really does?",
        "All right, that’s it, you guys! What happened out there?",
        "Come on!",
        "Ewwww!!",
        "(turning to look at Joey) Ewwww!!",
        "Oh-hooo, I missed you.",
        "Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you’ve grown. Y'know?",
        "You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, “Once a cheater, always a cheater.”",
        "Ooh, I just wish we hadn’t lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...",
        "Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!",
        "What?!!",
        "You fell asleep?!",
        "Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!",
        "Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you’re at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!",
        "(to Monica) Sorry!! (to Ross) I just feel bad about all that sleep you’re gonna miss wishing you were with me!",
        "And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!",
        "Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?",
        "Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.",
        "Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!",
        "Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?",
        "Oh, honey, that's so sweet.",
        "Oh my God! What happened?",
        "Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.",
        "And not one of your coupons for an hour of \"Joey Love.\"",
        "No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.",
        "Hey, how'd it go?",
        "You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.",
        "And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?",
        "No....",
        "Yes! Rent!",
        "What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.",
        "What did you get her? (Joey opens up a rectangular black box and holds up a pen.)",
        "Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?",
        "Any luck?",
        "All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.",
        "Aw, honey, that's so sweet.",
        "Oh! Pathetic! (Grabs the crossword puzzle and starts writing.)",
        "I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to hug!",
        "Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!",
        "Thanks!",
        "Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go?",
        "Yeah?",
        "May fifth, why?",
        "Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her.",
        "Well, have fun!",
        "Yeah, she's...",
        "You love her.",
        "(entering, with a guy) Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross.",
        "Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.",
        "Okay. (He starts to leave, and Rachel grabs him and gives him a passionate kiss.) I'll miss you.",
        "I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum.",
        "Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?",
        "What was that?",
        "Oh. (She tries to walk away from Josh, by he keeps holding her) Stop it!",
        "Yeah! (Monica gives a sarcastic thumbs up) (Josh leaves) I am soo gonna marry that guy. (looking in her wallet) Ohhh!",
        "I think he's stealing from me.",
        "Because he's stealing from me!",
        "Ughh! (Storms out after him)",
        "Well where's Amanda?",
        "I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.",
        "Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.",
        "(laughing) Ohh, that is soo sad.",
        "Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it! (Shows her, her ring)",
        "Sorry.",
        "Y'know...",
        "Yeah.",
        "No!",
        "(confused) Okay.",
        "(really confused) Okay.",
        "So are things with you and Joey any better?",
        "Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?",
        "You shouldn’t.",
        "Well, I’m gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.",
        "I know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, I just… (goes into her bedroom.)",
        "(standing in her doorway) People are trying to sleep in here!",
        "Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.",
        "Ooh, so cute, that I’m thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.",
        "I know, it’s sick.",
        "Because it’s Richard’s son! It’s like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!",
        "Is he okay in there?",
        "So now, what exactly is the point of the box?",
        "(worried) Why?",
        "Okay. (She goes into her bedroom)",
        "(coming out of her bedroom with a necklace) Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.",
        "Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.",
        "Well isn’t it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?",
        "Credit.",
        "Ooh, I like those sunglasses.",
        "(Swears in Italian, it’s the same term used by Joey earlier and Joey nods his approval.)",
        "Fancy soap? I thought we were savin’ that for the Pope!",
        "(pouring the wine) Sick-sick-sick-sick.",
        "Ross, can you pass me the yams?",
        "Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!",
        "Okay, fine. (She gets up and walks into her bedroom)",
        "Don’t say that I have no sentiment! (Starts to show Ross what’s in the box.) This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! (Holds up a bone) This is from the museum from the first time we… were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!",
        "Joey, had reasons.",
        "What?!",
        "Oh, he sees her!",
        "Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!",
        "Oh, I can’t believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.",
        "Why not?",
        "Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.",
        "Yeah, Phoebe you’re… awful!",
        "I know, I remember that!",
        "Well, Chandler, you’re gonna have to tell him.",
        "Because you do.",
        "Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.",
        "What?",
        "No?",
        "Oh!",
        "Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There’s an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss…",
        "Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and…",
        "God, I am so glad you don’t have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn’t even consider applying.",
        "(interrupting) And that’s I’m so glad… there’s no problem.",
        "Ohh! That’s great!",
        "Really?!",
        "Well, I, umm…",
        "Thank you.",
        "Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.",
        "Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.",
        "I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.",
        "Yes, I realize that…",
        "I love working with designers!",
        "(entering Joanna’s office) Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.",
        "No! It didn’t! That’s what I want to talk to you about. (starts to break up) Now, just to brief you… (starts to cry) I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.",
        "There’s nobody here!",
        "Do you want me to quit?",
        "Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y’know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, (She goes over to get all of her belongings from the desk, which amount to a muffin and a pen) and I will be gone by the end of the day! (Realizes she has nothing.) Well, I guess there’s no use to me sticking around ‘til the end of the day! (Starts to leave.)",
        "What?",
        "My drinking?",
        "Said what? Exactly.",
        "Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I’m leaving! You are just a horrible person!",
        "Say more things like that.",
        "I’d need an expense account.",
        "And an assistant.",
        "Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?",
        "Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I’m soo happy!",
        "Ohh, you’ve waited soo long.",
        "Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.",
        "How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale’s?",
        "Yes!!!",
        "Ohh, it’s gonna be so great! I’m gonna get to help decide what we sell, I’m gonna have an office with walls and everything. (turns to Monica) I’m gonna have walls!",
        "I’m an assistant buyer!!",
        "Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?",
        "Heard what?",
        "Oh my God! How?!",
        "Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!",
        "Oh, God. Oh, God. (gets worried) Oh God.",
        "Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before… it happened.",
        "Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she’d still be with us—nothing about an assistant buyer?",
        "Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn’t hear about Joanna…",
        "Hey, y’know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it’ll be Valentine’s Day, then my birthday, then bang!—before you know it, they’re lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! (hearing this, Gunther moves in) Y’know, I want a man!! (Gunther leaves depressed) I mean, it doesn’t even have to be a big relationship, y’know, just like a fling would be great.",
        "Well, believe me, it’s been a long time since I’ve been flung.",
        "Yeah! Wait a minute, it’s been a long time that I’ve been single. How come you never offered this before?",
        "Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don’t like guys with boring jobs.",
        "Hey, honey! What’s the matter? (Monica shows her, her hat.) Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!",
        "Well, wait a minute, you’re the boss! Why don’t you just yell at them? Or, fire them?",
        "Pheebs, that’s great!",
        "But y’know umm, Rachel doesn’t rhyme with draddle.",
        "Oh yeah!",
        "Really?!",
        "So, will I like any of these guys?",
        "Chandler!",
        "Ohh, I like swimmer’s bodies!",
        "Op, I like credit cards!",
        "Well, so what does he do?",
        "Your company has a fine foods division?",
        "(entering) Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!",
        "Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.",
        "Well, y'know, possibly. (pause) You didn’t tell him that, though? Right?",
        "You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don’t tell the guy that!",
        "Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date—oh, he’s so gonna get the wrong idea.",
        "Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?",
        "You idiot!!",
        "You don’t tell a guy that you’re looking for a serious relationship! You don’t tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!",
        "Y’know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!",
        "Oh! See just I’m right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks! (She sits down heavily in one of the new chairs)",
        "Really?",
        "No.",
        "Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.",
        "Well that sounds fun too. (They hug.)",
        "What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!",
        "Well you said *black*. Why would he want his blue blazer black?",
        "Don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?",
        "[nodding appreciatively] Nice, all right, yeah!",
        "Honey, this is really an incredible thing to do for them but there are things to think about.",
        "Wow, I don't know if I could ever do that. You know, I always figured the first time I had a baby, it would be with someone I love and that baby would be like, a keeper.",
        "Why don't you talk to someone who's had a baby. Like your mom.",
        "I am so jealous. You guys are just, really, right *there*, aren't you?",
        "Chandler, that is so nice.",
        "Why, just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, you should.",
        "Yeah, when we're in the audience, he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave.",
        "Yeah, not for girls anyway. Guys agree [snaps her fingers] like that.",
        "Let me see that. [looks at the drawing] Oh yeah.",
        "Well, you know, sometimes that helps.",
        "Well, if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Matterhorn.",
        "Oh, TOES!! [raises hands in air. They both look at her.] Yeah, for some people.",
        "[sadly] Oh.",
        "[looking away] Oh, I can't watch this. It's like \"Sophie's Choice.\"",
        "Oh, it was only okay.",
        "Depends who asked.",
        "Oh, Mon. Sure.",
        "Yes.",
        "You're not asking me, are you?",
        "Yes, totally.",
        "Bloomingdale’s eliminated my department. (Phoebe gasps)",
        "No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "(on the phone) Monica, I’m quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn’t even buy it! (Pause) I’m telling you I’m quitting! That’s it! I’m talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes I am! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. (Hangs up as her boss, Mr. Waltham, walks in.) Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you.",
        "Hi!",
        "Hi, I’m Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?",
        "Oh, I’m so sorry.",
        "Well, at least that’s a great suit.",
        "Okay.",
        "No-no, that wasn’t me! (To Joshua) Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. (Joshua turns at that) The selection of underwear we carry.",
        "Oh-oh, sorry, it’s this way, it’s this way. (Motions to the correct way.)",
        "I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!",
        "Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.",
        "Hi-e!!",
        "Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.",
        "It’s Joshua.",
        "Why? Honey, what is the big deal?",
        "Yeah, that’s true.",
        "Chandler, what did she say?",
        "Beefsteak Charlie’s?",
        "Whoops. (Starts to go into Chandler and Joey’s.) Oh, hey, do you need help with that?",
        "Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum. (She goes into Chandler and Joey’s.)",
        "Hi!",
        "So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It’s just so frustrating!",
        "Really? It doesn’t seem desperate?",
        "Hmm-mmm.",
        "Yeah but, I’ve never asked a guy out before.",
        "No. Have you?",
        "I don’t even know how I would go about it.",
        "You know what, I’m gonna do that, I’m gonna call him up, and I’m gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. (Practising) How you doin’? (Calls him) Hi! Joshua? It’s Rachel Green from Bloomingdale’s. (Listens) Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and we—(Listens) the license? Well, that is a good idea! Uh, well, let’s see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I’ll see you tomorrow. Bye. (Hangs up) (to Phoebe) You’ve done that a thousand times?",
        "Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.",
        "Really?! You think that will work?",
        "Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? (Tries again.) You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too… (Tries again.) Umm, who likes the Knicks—(Joshua comes in from the dressing room.)",
        "Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!",
        "Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. (She puts her arm in his and checks how they would look as a couple.) Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. (Pause) Umm, so you like it?",
        "Great.",
        "Sure.",
        "Yeah-eah-ha!",
        "Oh well, you don’t want to do that now?!",
        "Okay.",
        "Basketball!",
        "I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you’re interested, just as a thank you for this week.",
        "Really?",
        "I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.",
        "He didn’t turn me down! He’s at the game isn’t he? I got the date, I’m just not on it!",
        "Wow! Monica!",
        "Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.",
        "Really?",
        "Yes! I will! Absolutely! (She takes out his license and her license and holds them face to face with each other. She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in Spaceballs, and mimic a conversation between the two of them.) Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I’m glad. Rachel, I’d like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin’?",
        "What the hell is that?!! (to Monica) What the hell is that? Is that you? (Monica nods her head no, and Rachel realizes what is making that sound.) Ohhhhhhh! (storms over to Chandler and Joey’s with Monica in trail.)",
        "(angrily) BACK OFF!!! (She starts banging on their door.) Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!",
        "What is that noise?",
        "Well, I’ve been up since six. Thanks to somebody’s dumb-ass rooster.",
        "Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around…",
        "What?",
        "I’m so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.",
        "How many guesses do you get?",
        "No! There’s no orange juice in there! We win!!",
        "Okay, well, we won that one.",
        "Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.",
        "Fine! We’ll ask Phoebe.",
        "I know! I know, it’s such a huge, life-altering thing.",
        "Tails!",
        "We’ll take Literature!!",
        "Chandler gets it! It’s Chandler Bing!",
        "(shouting) It’s All Relative!!",
        "(shouting) I’m sorry!",
        "Monica, I don’t want to lose 200 dollars.",
        "Monica?!",
        "Okay, so let’s play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!",
        "Oooohh that’s interesting.",
        "Throw in the duck too!",
        "Well, he gets the other one all riled up.",
        "Monica, betting the apartment, I don’t know about this.",
        "Why? Do you have the answers written on there?",
        "All right, let’s do it.",
        "Okay. (They go into the living room.)",
        "All right!",
        "14?",
        "Space cowboy!",
        "Oh gosh, it has something to do with numbers.",
        "He carries a briefcase.",
        "Oh-oh-oh, he’s a transponce—transpondster!",
        "Oh my God.",
        "(entering from Chandler’s bedroom, I guess, and sees the foosball table.) Oh my God! I can’t believe you guys are actually think you’re moving in here!",
        "Well I-I-I’m not moving.",
        "No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!",
        "Noooo.",
        "What?!",
        "I don’t care, I’m not going anywhere.",
        "No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment and I like it! This is a girl’s apartment! That is a boy’s apartment, it’s dirty and it smells. This is pretty. It’s-it’s so pretty! And look, and it’s-it’s purple! And I’m telling you, you with the steady hand, I am not moving, and now I have got the steady hand. (She holds out her hand, which is shaking uncontrollably.)",
        "That’s right! You do what the hand says!",
        "How did it go?",
        "Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!",
        "That is not true. She did! She forced me!",
        "Well it stupid, unfair question!",
        "Will you stop calling it your apartment!",
        "No it’s not!",
        "Oh, I think I saw some in here.",
        "I don’t know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it’ll die.",
        "How does going to a strip club help him better?",
        "Um-hmm. (Joshua turns to look in the mirror and leaves Rachel staring at his ass.) There we go. There it is.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Oh, okay. Uhh, well let’s see. (Grabs his hand.) You’re about—well uh, this one is large. And this one—(Grabs the other hand.)",
        "Yeah! Okay, two larges coming right up!",
        "Yes.",
        "Sure. You got it. Great!",
        "Me, Fladermouse, great. I really—(motions to Joshua.)",
        "So? (She puts her hands in his, totally forgetting about the gloves, and hoping for something more intimate.)",
        "Ohh! Right! Right, sorry, I’ll be right back!",
        "Oh.",
        "No! Nothing!",
        "Yeah! That would be great!",
        "(shocked) Well, I-I guess—I…",
        "Yeah, great, you betcha!",
        "What?",
        "Oh. Oh, right.",
        "Oh yay!",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Hey, Monica!",
        "Ohh, it’s Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So… What are you gonna do?",
        "No! Help me!",
        "Phoebe?",
        "Ugh!",
        "Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is—I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y’know the \"Wouldn’t it be great if she was my wife\" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?",
        "Ohh! (Realises that Ross is in the room.) Hi!",
        "So….",
        "Ohhhh, come on!!!",
        "No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!",
        "I’ll be right there! (to Ross) Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we’ve gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?",
        "Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! (Monica opens the door.) Emily?",
        "I’m Rachel Green.",
        "There’s been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I’m not free tonight. So…",
        "Oh well, no I…",
        "I’ll get her.",
        "Hey—whoa, slow down. (Gets a whiff of him) No, keep moving. (Joey runs off.) Wow!",
        "Well, I didn’t see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face.",
        "The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.",
        "No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, \"I’m Rachel Greep! I’m Rachel Greep!\" and he let her right in.",
        "No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can’t believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.",
        "Honey, that’s you’re name.",
        "What? Who the hell is Emily—(realises) noooo!!",
        "They’re in Vermont!! How could this happen?! (She waves her arms franticly and hits Chandler.)",
        "How—how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?! (She hits Chandler again.)",
        "I don’t get this! She was horrible! (She hits Chandler, yet again.)",
        "I don’t care! All right, y’know what I’m just upset that I’m getting nowhere with Joshua that—y’know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!",
        "Oh, y’know, would you just for once, not remember every…little…thing!! (Storms out.)",
        "(joining them) Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn’t call. I mean you’d think he’d be worried about me not showing up at his club. Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!",
        "(entering) I can’t believe it! He still hasn’t called.",
        "It’s Joshua.",
        "No, I don’t.",
        "Yeah, come on! What’s going in on in there? (Pats his chest.)",
        "See, I don’t know, for me it would have to Chantal.",
        "Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh…",
        "Well, are we all together? Like in a group?",
        "Oh, hey!",
        "What?",
        "Oh, hmm.",
        "Joshua.",
        "Yeah, I…",
        "Oh, thank goodness!",
        "Oh, no problem. I’m so glad I could help. Happy for you. (She playfully punches him.)",
        "No, happy for you! (Hits him harder.)",
        "No-no-no, that’ not Joshua.",
        "Chandler, there’s a guy right over there. (Points to the counter)",
        "Chandler, don’t worry! This doesn’t make you less of a guy! (Chandler starts blowing on his fingernails like women do.) That does! (Chandler stops blowing.) What am I sitting on? (She looks and finds a huge nail.) I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Well, here’s another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?",
        "Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?",
        "Guess who we ran into today?!",
        "You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.",
        "(entering, with Joey) Hey!",
        "Y’know, you-you also could’ve used uh, lamps and then followed the light.",
        "It’s coming from Joey!",
        "Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.",
        "(starts laughing, Ross stares at her) I’m sorry. I’m sorry. You’re right, you are a tough guy. You’re the toughest palaeontologist I know.",
        "Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin’ at him.",
        "You…are…not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?",
        "No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.",
        "(refers to the table) What are these?",
        "Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?",
        "Wow! If only more people knew.",
        "Hey!",
        "(noticing a bunch of pictures around the door that weren’t there originally.) What-what are-what are these?",
        "Oh my God! Look at this!",
        "I don’t care! The wires have come loose in your head!",
        "And did you?!",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.",
        "Thank God.",
        "Well, Joshua’s coming in tomorrow and since I don’t have the guts to ask him out, I’m going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.",
        "Oh, here’s that trench-coat that you wanted.",
        "Yeah?",
        "(stopping him) Oh no-no, no-no, they don’t want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.",
        "Well, that’s because of a lot of…(She imitates someone picking their nose and placing the treasure found in the pockets.)",
        "I know!",
        "Oh?",
        "Well, congratulations, so do you love her?",
        "Huh. Well, uh, that’s uh, that’s interesting. (She goes over and retrieves her note.)",
        "Oh, it’s just an anti-theft device.",
        "You need that, you need that too ‘cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up. (Rips up the note.)",
        "Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.",
        "We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it’s actually for Joshua. (Starts handing out party hats.) Look, he said he’s not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him! (Hands Ross a party hat.)",
        "Surprise!!!",
        "Well, it was all Ross’s idea.",
        "Uhh, because I’m trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he’s looking over here, say something funny.",
        "Okay, y’know what, y’know what? This playing hard to get thing is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. (Chandler does so.) Okay. Okay. (She does a little sexy walk over to where Joshua is standing.) Hi!",
        "Care for a cherry?",
        "No? Y’know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.",
        "Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?",
        "Up!",
        "Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.",
        "Ohh, God! Look at him, he’s so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?",
        "What?",
        "It’s not Christmas!",
        "He’s not 11!",
        "What? You’re leaving?!",
        "No! You guys can’t leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!",
        "(spinning the bottle) So, Spin the Bottle works like this: I spin the bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. (She crawls over to where Gunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on Gunther’s face and decides not to kiss him.) All right. Who wants to go first?",
        "Yay! Emily!",
        "Okay, my turn!!",
        "It’s okay! It’s okay! It kicked once, it’ll kick again!",
        "All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.",
        "Just a bug.",
        "No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn’t working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.",
        "Hi!",
        "Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye cheer. So okay! (Runs into the living room) Ready! Okay! Gimme an ‘E!’",
        "Gimme an ‘M!’",
        "Gimme an ‘I!’",
        "Gimme an ‘L!’",
        "Gimme a ‘Y!’",
        "What do you get? (She throws her pom-poms to Joey and Phoebe and performs a cartwheel.) Emily!! (Tries to do another one.) Emil—Whoa!! (She falls in Chandler’s room.) Okay! So that’s me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum! (Gunther’s the only one that claps.)",
        "I’m fine! I’m fine! I’m just losing a tooth, it’s no big deal. I have a dentist! Y’know. I’m gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. (She goes over to the ice and Joey and Monica follow her.) What do I do now? What do I do now?",
        "All right, come on, let’s go get your coat.",
        "Oh, yeah! Real fun. (She makes a decision.) Y’know, this bra… Really, bothers me. (She starts taking off her bra.) Y’know, this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could talk, y’know what they’d say? Wanna hear some memories? (She is now violently pulling on her bra in order to remove it, but it isn’t co-operating.)",
        "Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.",
        "Ughhhh!! Forget it! (Sits down heavily on the bed.) This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.",
        "Can you not look at me when I say this? (He turns around) I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.",
        "Well, I’m sorry, I thought you needed them!",
        "Why?!",
        "You like me?",
        "Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can’t believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!",
        "Oh no-no-no don’t say but! No-no, but’s never good! Let’s just leave it at, you like me and I like you.",
        "Oh, now see that’s a fancy but.",
        "But….",
        "Okay.",
        "Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua’s gone so you and Emily are free to go.",
        "Oh, Ross, I’m sorry. I completely ruined your evening.",
        "Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.",
        "Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?",
        "I’m so sorry.",
        "Well, maybe you didn’t want it to end?",
        "You seem to really like her.",
        "Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.",
        "Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I don’t know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.",
        "Hey.",
        "You’re a pathetic loser, right?",
        "Sit!",
        "Oh my gosh, Joshua!",
        "They’re not true?",
        "Oh.",
        "Oh! Oh, I love that but.",
        "You wanna go inside and have some coffee?",
        "Okay. (Joshua goes inside and to Chandler.) Every time.",
        "All right, y’know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat? (She makes a move for the remote.)",
        "Honey, what are you doing? That’s too heavy.",
        "Give it here. (She takes the table.) Oh, God. (And gives it to Monica right away.)",
        "Is that the heartbeat?",
        "Oh wow! This is so cool.",
        "Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!",
        "What’s that song? It has been in my head all day long.",
        "Y’know who doesn’t even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.",
        "No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.",
        "Yes!",
        "I’m going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny. (As she exits, Phoebe enters.) Hey, Pheebs!",
        "Hey!",
        "Well, so, why don’t you just turn it off?",
        "Well, what-what ‘cha got there?",
        "Honey, you’re not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.",
        "Hey!",
        "Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised…",
        "Okay.",
        "(interrupting) Relaxi-Taxi!",
        "Well, well I can up with it!",
        "Well, I…",
        "Okay, it’s not Relaxi Cab. It’s Relaxicab, like taxicab.",
        "Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing. (She’s holding two frilly, lace nighties.)",
        "Sorry. I’m so exited! I’ve been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I’m making him a very fancy meal.",
        "What am I making him by the way?",
        "I thought I was making him filet mignon?",
        "Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.",
        "Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. (They kiss.) Ahh. So, dig in!",
        "(taking a bite) Hmmm!",
        "Oh I know, my God, this is so—this rice is so—I am so good.",
        "(sees the chick and the duck) Oh, yeah, I’m sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.",
        "Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.",
        "All gone! So, farm birds, huh?",
        "Oh.",
        "Okay. So, can I serve you a little of—What? What? What? (She sees that Joshua isn’t relaxed.)",
        "But, they’re across the hall! I mean that’s two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.",
        "Okay, y’know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y’know go to your apartment.",
        "Your parents’?",
        "Ohh.",
        "Yeah that works.",
        "Wow! This place is fabulous!",
        "Whoa-whoa, there’s two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must’ve been a real babe magnet.",
        "Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?",
        "That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?",
        "Ah.",
        "Hi you!",
        "I know, I can do more than cook.",
        "Ohh! It’s so nice to meet you. (She goes over and shakes their hands.) Hello.",
        "Hello.",
        "What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not—that’s-that’s not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. It’s-it’s, they’re-they’re wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale’s, so… And obviously in uh, in-in this case, (She grabs a pen and paper) I am going to report back, \"USA not ready.\"",
        "Yes!",
        "Well, we were going to do that after—I mean umm, next.",
        "Oh, yeah, well… Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin’ around the house.",
        "Yes.",
        "Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.",
        "No, it’s all right. I got nice boobs. (Phoebe and Monica nod there heads in agreement.)",
        "So?",
        "Huh.",
        "She’s totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.",
        "Absolutely! Absolutely!",
        "What—yeah—what, y’know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.",
        "Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!",
        "Oh! It’s you. (She stops doing the dishes.) Hi.",
        "Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so…",
        "Oh.",
        "Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but I’m okay.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, that’s sweet.",
        "(breaking the hug) Uhh, hang in there?",
        "I mean maybe you didn’t hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?",
        "Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has—yeah. Oh no, those were four great dates.",
        "Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean y’know, emotionally, mentally, physically…",
        "I know isn’t it? It’s like I’m right there with Joshua.",
        "You are right there with Emily. And it’s y’know, it’s kinda like…. it’s a tie! Well, I gotta get, I gotta get back to the dishes.",
        "Oh yeah? Fine.",
        "Oh yeah, no, what’s that?",
        "That would be great!",
        "(to the closed door) Hang in there. You hang in there. (Gives him the raspberry.)",
        "No, just singing. (Does a little song.)",
        "(entering) Hi!",
        "Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There’s nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn’t for me and Joshua. Y’know, they’re not gonna get married anyway!",
        "Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it’s ridiculous! I mean, they’re gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they’ve done and they’re call the whole thing off. I’m telling ya, you’re gonna be dancing at my wedding before you’re dancing at there’s.",
        "Why not?",
        "Nothing.",
        "In a month?",
        "You mean, you mean 30 days?",
        "From now?",
        "Well, that’s great.",
        "Hi!",
        "Ohh, nothing, I just wanted to see you. See you and hug you. (Hugs him) See you.",
        "Yeah! (She sits down) Sit!",
        "I’m more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?",
        "‘Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are, I think we are so on the right track! Y’know? I mean, I think we are working, I think we are clicking. Y’know?",
        "Yeah-yeah, y’know if-if there was just like one little area where I—that I think we need—we would need to work on; I-I would think it was we’re just not crazy enough!",
        "Well, yeah, right, y’know what? Yeah, you’re right, I mean, we no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if (Grunts uncomprehensively)……I mean, I mean like craaaazy! Y’know? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound y’know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married?",
        "Oh, I know, I know, it’s-it’s so, it’s so totally like, \"Whoa! Can we do this?\" Y’know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right! Don’t you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don’t you think?",
        "(entering from her bedroom) Well, I just called Joshua…",
        "Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married—I’m just going through a hard time.",
        "Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue.",
        "Yeah, maybe, but I don’t think I even care. I don’t think he’s the one I’m sad about. Y’know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don’t think I’m handling it all that well.",
        "And I-I am just trying to figure out why.",
        "Well, yeah, y’know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.",
        "Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.",
        "Three people. Joshua’s not gonna be there.",
        "Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.",
        "Well, apparently he scares easy.",
        "It’s okay. Sometimes, things don’t work out the way you’d thought they would.",
        "(breaking the hug) Oh, hey, don’t you have to go pick up Emily?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah! I got my girls.",
        "Ugh. (She goes over and lays her head on Phoebe’s lap.)",
        "What?",
        "Y’know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.",
        "Oh, okay! (She goes to answer the door.)",
        "I’m not gonna marry Chandler!",
        "Okay, you guys, just relax. (She goes over to open the door, and as she does, she says.) I doooo. (Sees that it’s Joshua, not Chandler that knocked on the door.)",
        "Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! (Pause) (Comes back inside) Yeah, well, that oughta do it.",
        "HEY!! Do you have to do that? It’s Saturday!",
        "I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!",
        "Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.",
        "Monica, you don’t even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!",
        "I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "So—Hey, Pheebs! So, how are the elves?",
        "Yeah, my mom got my dad’s season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Do you guys want these?",
        "Ohh, well you got ‘em.",
        "Just give us our apartment back!",
        "Oh, come on! We know what these are worth.",
        "You’re bachelor pad?!",
        "Or I’ll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.",
        "All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?",
        "Let me finish.",
        "I’m talking about a bet, winner takes all.",
        "Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she’s the only who’s impartial, and she’s so pretty.",
        "What? Shut up! We’re winning!",
        "Okay.",
        "All right, cut, let’s pick again, pick again.",
        "Come on apartment! Come on apartment! (Picks a card.) Oh! I know queen is high!",
        "We took our apartment back!! (Slams the door shut.)",
        "All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.",
        "Let us keep the apartment and…",
        "Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, I-I heard. (Pause, everyone looks at each other, waiting for Rachel’s reaction.) I think it’s great! (Hugs Ross.) Ohh, I’m so happy for you!",
        "So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?",
        "Whoa! Hey-hey, you planning on inviting us?",
        "Hormones!",
        "Nooo!",
        "All right fine! You’re not invited to the party we’re gonna have either.",
        "Well umm…",
        "Little village people.",
        "Oh, that is so sweet!",
        "Huh. Except, Phoebe’s not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.",
        "Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!",
        "Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she’s always wanted!",
        "Hi! Phoebe. (Both Monica and her try to move out of Phoebe’s way.)",
        "No we…",
        "…hormones, yeah.",
        "Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross’s wedding.",
        "It just might be too hard, given the history and all that…",
        "Well, h-how is this like that?",
        "(starting to cry) I’m-I’m sorry, I just thought that…",
        "Good.",
        "What?! She made the tea! (Points to Monica.)",
        "You what?",
        "Okay. It’s okay. We’re gonna be okay. Y’know what? It’s okay. I’m gonna, I’m gonna, I’m gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!",
        "Okay! (Runs and grabs a book and hands it to Monica.) Okay! Here!",
        "I don’t know!",
        "I still don’t get how you know when it’s false labour.",
        "Well, isn’t that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.",
        "No, really. Really, Pheebs, you’re not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they’re bad, y’know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won’t calm down. Y’know?",
        "And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!",
        "And y’know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you.",
        "Oh!",
        "What?!",
        "What?!",
        "(To the woman sitting in front of her) He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?",
        "Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.",
        "Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can’t pretend that didn’t happen can I?",
        "Monica, what should I do?",
        "What?",
        "Whoa, wait, listen, I think I’m just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.",
        "Okay, you’re right. You’re right. You can’t help me.",
        "Oh, hi!",
        "Hi. Sorry, things aren’t working out so well.",
        "Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she’s gonna get over this, y’know? I mean, so you said my name! Y’know you just said it ‘cause you saw me there, if you’d have seen a circus freak, you would’ve said, \"I take thee circus freak.\" Y’know, it didn’t mean anything, it’s just a mistake. It didn’t mean anything. Right?",
        "Right…",
        "(laughs) Y’know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.",
        "Get the hell out of there, y’know?",
        "Well, look at that, same thing.",
        "Ross said my name. Okay? My name. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me! (They both just stare at her.) Okay, don’t believe me, I know I’m right—do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?",
        "Okay.",
        "Hello? Oh, Pheebs! (To them) It’s Phoebe!",
        "Hi!",
        "Well, Ross said my name.",
        "Okay, Pheebs, y’know what, let’s look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then…",
        "(entering, carrying an armful of those little soaps.) Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there’s a whole cart outside… (Sees the Walthams and stops.)",
        "(she stops and turns) Hi!",
        "Well, I-I-I’ve been on Standby for a flight home for hours.",
        "Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?",
        "So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?",
        "Yeah. I’m sorry.",
        "No, you’re not an idiot, Ross. You’re a guy very much in love.",
        "No, you know what, I think you should go.",
        "Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it’d be really good.",
        "Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Good!",
        "Right!",
        "Right!",
        "Okay, I’ll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.",
        "What? Wait, what?",
        "Well-well, I don’t know Ross—really?",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!",
        "Okay!",
        "All right!",
        "Oh, okay, we’re going. Yeah.",
        "Oh, wait-wait-wait…",
        "Okay. Wait! Wait!",
        "Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot and uh, (points to Ross’s seat.) he will have a white wine spritzer. Woo! (Looks out the window.) Hey, look at that, the airport’s moving. (Realizes that that’s not how it works.) Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the captain know that we’re moving? (Sits back in defeat.) Oh my God. Oh, my gosh.",
        "Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!",
        "Hi, sure!",
        "I knew.",
        "I did.",
        "Yeah, maybe...",
        "Really?",
        "Oh Ross, you're so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up]",
        "OK.",
        "Ohhh!!!! [looking at something behind Ross]",
        "Oh, look at the little cat! [a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross] Look at it!",
        "All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!",
        "[to Ross] Yes! Did you see that?",
        "I could not have done this without you.",
        "[hurt] What?",
        "Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?",
        "Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.",
        "'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.",
        "Good. [Ross leaves]",
        "Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I’m doing something that I’m actually good at. I mean. if you don’t get that...",
        "Well neither do I!",
        "(shocked) Oh my God.",
        "Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you’re, you’re, you’re making this too hard.",
        "I don’t know, I don’t know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.",
        "No. (Ross is standing in the doorway.) A break from us.",
        "Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.",
        "So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?",
        "(opening the door) Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here! ",
        "Just get out! Now!!",
        "Okay! All right! How was she?",
        "Was she good?",
        "Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let’s talk about it!! How was she?",
        "Good different?",
        " ...the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you’ve grown. Y'know?  I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, “Once a cheater, always a cheater.”  Ooh, I just wish we hadn’t lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...",
        "You seem to really like her.",
        "Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.",
        "Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.",
        "Yeah.",
        "(entering) Hey guys! What’s up?",
        "What’s this? Is this Ross’s wedding invitation?",
        "Oh, no! No you guys! Come on, you don’t have to do that! I’m happy for him! I am! I really—I’m-I’m happ—I’ll work on it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, honey, I don’t know. I…",
        "No, I’ll think about it. Yeah.",
        "Who's this from?",
        "Oh... [opens it]... [sees it is a pin] Oh my God. He remembered.",
        "It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!",
        "What did you just say?",
        "Oh.... my God.",
        " (seeing Ross come off the plane with another woman.) Oh my God.",
        "Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?",
        " She didn't hang up either...",
        "[on phone] Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat...(cut)...I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure. [hangs up and tosses phone in the ice bucket]",
        "Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . . [jumps the couch and lands on Ross's back, finally getting the phone from him. Ross has a confused expression on his face.]",
        "Ohhhhhhhh God. [climbs off his back]",
        "Ohh, ohh.",
        "Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.",
        "Really?",
        "Oh, god.",
        "Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight.",
        "Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.",
        "Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!",
        "Noo.",
        "Noo! Maybe! I, I don’t know.",
        "I just, I feel, I-I just...",
        "Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!",
        "And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Oh.",
        "I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.",
        "Yeah. It’s just gonna be too hard. Y’know? I mean, it’s Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y’know it’s just, it’s for the best, y’know it is, it’s… Y’know, plus, somebody’s got to stay here with Phoebe! Y’know she’s gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.",
        "I know. (Starts to cry) Yeah, see, there’s so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.",
        "Who are you saying \"check\" too?",
        "Have fun!",
        "Oh, I know.",
        "What?!",
        "Yeah, well, I gotta work, I’m sorry.",
        "Because, I can’t! Ross, I told you, no. I can’t.",
        "Oh, honey! Don’t get up! What do you need?",
        "Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.",
        "Okay, that is all you.",
        "Oh, I don’t know. I guess we have to eat.",
        "I’m just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn’t have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.",
        "(interrupting) Still in love with?!",
        "I’m not in love with Ross!",
        "Phoebe, I’m going to Ross’s wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I’m still in love with him! I mean, hey, y’know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y’know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don’t mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn’t mean that-that I’m still in love with him. Y’know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him—Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my—why didn’t you tell me?!!",
        "We?!",
        "You all know? Does Ross know?",
        "Oh, I can not believe you didn’t tell me!",
        "(depressed) Hi.",
        "Manhattan does not have enough stores.",
        "You can?",
        "Um-hmm.",
        "Okay.",
        "Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?",
        "I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.",
        "I don’t know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y’know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.",
        "Okay.",
        "All right.",
        "Okay.",
        "Ow!",
        "Well, I like you less!",
        "Pheebs?",
        "Do you remember where the duck food is?",
        "(enters with a bag packed) Because I’m going to London.",
        "Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you don’t have those babies until I get back. (Kisses her stomach.)",
        "Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.",
        "Ohh—Do you think he will?!",
        "Y’know what? No. It’s not over until someone says, \"I do.\" (Exits)",
        "(Running to the ticket counter) Ooh, ooh, ooh,ooh,ooh. (Slightly out of breath) Hi.",
        "(Faking cheerfulness.) Hello. Umm, when is your next flight to London?",
        "Ohh, good.",
        "Ohh, thank you, thank you, thank you.",
        "(looking through her wallet.) Ohh, I just don’t think I have enough left on my credit card.",
        "Ohh, okay, how about five. (She hands her all the credit cards.) Ohh, thank you.",
        "(Looking through her purse.) Okay, you know what? I don’t have it, but I can tell you exactly where it is on my night stand, and...okay. But you know what? I have my drivers license and I have a twenty. (She slides it across the counter.)",
        "(Running to her room.) Hi, Pheebs.",
        "(Running back out the door with her passport.) Bye, Pheebs.",
        "Hi, I’m back. Listen, I need to...",
        "Hello. I need to get on the 11 o'clock flight.",
        "Okay, you know what/ You’re going to have to call that plane and tell them to swing around and come and pick me up.",
        "Sure, you know what? Come on, we’ll just tell them that there was like a problem with like the \"engine\".",
        "Look, If I don’t get to London!! He is going to marry that other girl!!!",
        "All right, you know what? I am not leaving here, until you call that plane back!! (She pounds her hand on the counter twice. The ticket agent counters by placing the closed sign on the counter and tapping it twice.)",
        "Ohhh.(she rhythmically taps her hands on the magazine on her lap.)",
        "Yeah?",
        "Oh. I’m sorry. I’m very sorry. Sorry. (She hums and sighs happily.) It’s just, I’m ahh, I’m kinda excited. I’m, ahh, going to London to ahh, tell this guy that I love him and... (He puts his headphones on to ignore her.)",
        "...And so then I realized. All this stuff I had been doing. proposing to Joshua, lying to Ross about why I couldn’t come to the wedding. Was all just a way of...",
        "Ehh, pardon me?",
        "But he has to know how I feel!",
        "(Sighing) Well I-I think your wrong.",
        "Well I just came...(She touches him near his heart. She’s almost in tears.) I just needed to tell you...(Looking into his eyes. She takes a deep breath.) Congratulations. (He hugs her. She can barely hold back the tears.)",
        "(entering) Hi!",
        "Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do.",
        "Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel. (Goes and puts her luggage away.)",
        "Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.",
        "Oh no, you're the best.",
        "What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, \"Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?\" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.",
        "Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.",
        "Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.",
        "That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.",
        "Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't--I still can't believe it. (Rachel grabs the picture from Monica)",
        "I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it (She grabs the rest of the pictures)…",
        "…I mean it's my fault.",
        "Oh my God! (She licks the top picture and hands them back.)",
        "Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda…",
        "Oh, I don't know. I don't know.",
        "All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.",
        "Hey!",
        "Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.",
        "Well…",
        "That's not European!",
        "Oh God, I really had a good time!",
        "Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?",
        "Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this. Umm, okay, just hold on a second.",
        "Umm, hi!",
        "Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.",
        "What's that? (Points to the box.)",
        "Oh, honey that's awful.",
        "But, it's not raining.",
        "Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All right? (She goes out to talk to Dave) Hey, Dave!",
        "Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye! (She goes back in to talk to Ross.) Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now.",
        "Yeah. (She goes out to join her in the hall and starts looking for the dropped socks.)",
        "Ohh! You did not drop any socks!",
        "Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted…tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him.",
        "Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!",
        "Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.",
        "Well… (At a loss for words, she grabs some of Monica's laundry and throws it on the floor as a diversion to allow Rachel to run back inside and close the door. Monica chases her to find that Rachel had locked the door.)",
        "No.",
        "Well, then talk!",
        "Yes!",
        "I'm gonna do it.",
        "But I…",
        "All right, fine.",
        "(stopping him) Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just--y'know--stop it!",
        "Phoebe, woo!",
        "Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.",
        "Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.",
        "Yeah, I-I don't care.",
        "What 'cha readin'?",
        "Yeah, what's it about?",
        "Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.",
        "Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.",
        "Okay.",
        "Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh, (pause) I'm still in love with you Ross.",
        "(Laughing) I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.",
        "Because (laughs), because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know? And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel (laughs) was like, \"You are such an idiot!\"",
        "(laughs) I'm sorry, that's not funny.",
        "Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?",
        "The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.",
        "Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?",
        "That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice. (They hug.)",
        "High-five, the babies are coming! (They all high-five.)",
        "I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!",
        "You-you're not wearing a jacket.",
        "Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.",
        "Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.",
        "(entering) Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.",
        "They're male nurses.",
        "Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?",
        "What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.",
        "What?",
        "Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.",
        "Joey, how do you make that dirty?",
        "Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!",
        "Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!",
        "Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!",
        "Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane.",
        "Me?!",
        "No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!!",
        "No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.",
        "Y'know who I always liked? Mork.",
        "Yeah, but umm… Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't hurt, right?",
        "Hi!",
        "Monica, this is Dan (points to him), one of the guys that we're gonna be going out with on Saturday. (Mouths \"He's yours.\" to her.) Uh Dan, Monica.",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh, honey, don’t worry. She's gonna make it on time.",
        "Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh?",
        "Yeah, fair enough.",
        "Oh, how does he look? How does he look?",
        "(entering) Hi. (To Phoebe) Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to tell you that they're still outside making phone calls.",
        "Yeah, umm, no honey.",
        "So does it really hurt as bad as they say?",
        "Hi! I just wanna-(sees Monica)-Ahhh!!! Oh my God! (She runs out in horror.) Oh my God!",
        "Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!",
        "(Gasps) That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?",
        "Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. (There's a knock on the door.) Maybe that's him. (Goes to answer the door.)",
        "Why aren't you guys at the movie?",
        "So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?",
        "So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?",
        "I don’t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best s*x she ever had!",
        "What-what-what are you gonna do?",
        "Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.",
        "Chandler! (Pause) Is he?",
        "(entering) Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!",
        "For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.",
        "Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!",
        "Like what?",
        "Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.",
        "Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to… Hi!",
        "Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. (The phone starts ringing.) I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. (The phone keeps ringing.) Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!",
        "(entering) Hi, guys!",
        "What's going on?",
        "Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?",
        "(going through the mail) Oh look! A letter from my mom.",
        "Oh yeah! I know.",
        "(interrupting) Oh my God! My dog died!",
        "Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!",
        "Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine-(turns over the note)-teen blocks. Oh. (They all come out from Monica's bedroom) Oh my God.",
        "It's Le Poo.",
        "Oh yeah! (Turns to face him.)",
        "What?",
        "Oh God. (He hands her some tissues.) No! Oh not again! (Wiping her nose.) This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry. (She puts her head back.) Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?",
        "Sorry. Sorry.",
        "Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.",
        "Hi!",
        "Okay, what's up?",
        "Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.",
        "Yeah?",
        "That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? (Pause) (Realizes) Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?",
        "Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!",
        "Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.",
        "Storming out!",
        "Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!",
        "(entering) Hi!",
        "Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?",
        "That's not Ross!",
        "Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.",
        "(To Joey) Do you even know who Kip is?",
        "See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!",
        "Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. (To Chandler) He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.",
        "Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out.",
        "Phoebe? (She turns her head further away.) I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing. (Moves over next to her.) You gotta come with me!",
        "Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.",
        "Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?",
        "Oh, Ross…",
        "No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.",
        "Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!",
        "I know.",
        "I know that too.",
        "Yeah, it's in there. (Points to the bathroom.)",
        "Uh-huh!",
        "Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?",
        "I want the little round waffles.",
        "Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!",
        "Arghhhh!!!!!!",
        "You guys! You guys!",
        "It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!",
        "(proud of herself) Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?",
        "Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.",
        "Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.",
        "Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.",
        "Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.",
        "Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!",
        "Really?",
        "Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!",
        "What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!",
        "Hi!",
        "What? Yeti—I mean Danny?",
        "Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so…. Y'know.",
        "(shocked) What?",
        "What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!",
        "So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!",
        "Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.",
        "And stop saying that! I hate that!",
        "Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?",
        "What?!",
        "Okay. Okay.",
        "(entering) Hi!",
        "Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.",
        "That yeti is one smooth talker.",
        "Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.",
        "Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really… I don't mind.",
        "Ross, I…",
        "Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.",
        "I haven't seen him in so long!",
        "Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?",
        "Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.",
        "Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.",
        "Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?",
        "I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.",
        "What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!",
        "Not for me. Chip and I broke up!",
        "Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was going to come over…",
        "Okay, Monica, can you just call it s*x?! It really creeps me out when you call it that! Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his tenderness. Believe me! (Walks into the living room and greets Monica's parents.) Hi!",
        "Happy Thanksgiving!",
        "Oh! No, not really.",
        "Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!",
        "Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly. (Ross is overhearing this.) Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!",
        "Guess what?! All that stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut was all a rumor so Chip dumped her and he wants to come over to my house tonight!",
        "I know!",
        "Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.",
        "I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!",
        "Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.",
        "No, it wasn't. It was actually the…",
        "Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology building.",
        "Oh hi!",
        "No, God! Please, let me! (Runs out.)",
        "Hey!",
        "(entering) Oh-ho, my God! That was so awesome! You totally got him back for calling you fat! He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great!",
        "What?!",
        "Okay, that we may be able to do.",
        "Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have s*x.",
        "Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have s*x with him! You're just gonna make him think that you are.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Then, you will definitely get him back!",
        "Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.",
        "Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel! (She grabs it and starts rubbing it on her cheek.) Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.",
        "Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. (To Chandler) Hey, what's up? (She leaves and closes the door behind her.)",
        "You brought a carrot?!",
        "Thank you. (To Monica) Mon?",
        "How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.",
        "Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.",
        "I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.",
        "Hi Danny! (Notices his box of liquor he's carrying.) Wow! Thirsty huh?",
        "Ohh, great!",
        "Yeah.",
        "(laughs) Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.",
        "That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?",
        "No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?",
        "Exactly.",
        "Oh, hi Danny.",
        "Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy.",
        "Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.",
        "It's a uh, regatta gala.",
        "No-no, but I support it.",
        "Okay. (Closes the door.) Walked right into that one didn't he?",
        "Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, \"No!\" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.",
        "Ball? There is no ball.",
        "Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.",
        "What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!",
        "Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!",
        "No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy.",
        "Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party.",
        "Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.",
        "Yeah, sure. (To Monica) All right, whose court is the ball in now?",
        "Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!",
        "Oh, go on! You telling people about me?",
        "(laughs) Yeah, okay, at ease solider!",
        "No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros!",
        "Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, \"Nice try.\"",
        "Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!",
        "Yeah!",
        "All right! Who's are they? Who's are they?",
        "Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?",
        "(waving them in his face) Take 'em! (Joey makes a noise and jumps out of the way.) Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear.",
        "Hey, Pheebs!",
        "What are you reading?",
        "Honey that sounds like fun.",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh, I read that in high school.",
        "(To Phoebe) Sorry I'm late, but I left late.",
        "So Pheebs, what is the book about?",
        "Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway—umm, what is this book about?",
        "Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.",
        "Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.",
        "Well, honey that was pretty obvious.",
        "Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!",
        "Joey, is what she just said umm—Oh my God. (Looks around the room.) You were actually gonna… (Chandler picks this moment to return to the living room.) (Rachel stares in shock.)",
        "And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?",
        "Hi!",
        "(sitting down) So umm, what's this book about?",
        "Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.",
        "Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.",
        "Come on Phoebe! Don’t be such a goodie-goodie!",
        "A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!",
        "Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.",
        "Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.",
        "(entering, angrily) Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!",
        "That was not funny!",
        "Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!",
        "Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?",
        "(sees the picture) Oh my God! That's Monica!!",
        "You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!",
        "Joey has got a secret peephole!",
        "Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them!",
        "Look! (Shows Ross the picture.)",
        "Well, what is the truth?",
        "Monica, is this true?",
        "Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?",
        "And the video camera?",
        "Oh my god. Ok you guys, there’s Danny. Watch. Just watch this. (He walks past the couch to the counter.) See?! Still pretending he’s not interested. Ohh, he’s coming over. Just pretend like we don’t know him. We’ve forgotten who he is.",
        "Thanks, Mon.",
        "Monica!!!",
        "(Somewhat angrily) Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don’t answer me. (Giggling) I have a date with Danny.",
        "I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.",
        "Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!",
        "No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!",
        "She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.",
        "So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.",
        "You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? (Danny nods, \"Yes.\") Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch!",
        "Hi!",
        "(not sure what to do) Uh, it was very nice meeting you. (They continue to ignore her.)",
        "(entering from her room) Hey!",
        "Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?",
        "Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?",
        "Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.",
        "Yeah, they were very y'know…wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?",
        "Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks. (She leaves them to wrestle.)",
        "Oh, great!",
        "Okay, see? I told you!",
        "Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.",
        "Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and…",
        "Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's…",
        "No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.",
        "No-no, they're not very nice people.",
        "Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of…",
        "Yeah, okay, I'll see you later. (Gets up and runs from the apartment.)",
        "I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!",
        "Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!",
        "I'm not reading this!",
        "Come on Joey!!!",
        "I can't believe you would say that!",
        "No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! (She sits next to him on the couch.) Fine I want—I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?",
        "Is he romantic with her?",
        "Are they in love?",
        "You don't know anything.",
        "What?",
        "Pheebs, I don’t think anyone's mad about that.",
        "Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.",
        "(To Monica) Hey!",
        "What's up?!",
        "Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?",
        "Oh y'know what, we don’t have to talk about work. We can talk about anything!",
        "Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!",
        "Nothing! You go!",
        "Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, (checks watch) y'know what though Mon, I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if—are you sure there's just not anything else?",
        "No! (Gets up to leave.) (Under her breath.) If there was I wouldn't tell you.",
        "Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.",
        "There he is!",
        "Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!",
        "You walked around all night in the city by yourself?",
        "Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.",
        "Ross! Janice?!",
        "(entering) Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!",
        "Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.",
        "I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, \"I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours.\" And he said, \"Laundry? Is that my new nickname?\" And you said, \"No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big.\"",
        "Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.",
        "What?!",
        "All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.",
        "Sure! Why?",
        "What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!",
        "Hey! Hi!",
        "Well, I was actually—I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.",
        "That's good enough. Right? (Pause.) Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my books!",
        "Okay.",
        "'Kay. (Pause.) Congratulations on your new job. (She goes and hugs Monica and is almost in tears.)",
        "Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.",
        "Sure! (Pause) God, please take those off!",
        "What?",
        "Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?",
        "Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?",
        "Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay. (Goes and grabs a bag, that looks like a purse, and shows it to Joey.)",
        "It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.",
        "No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. (Shows him.) See look, men, carrying the bag.",
        "Exactly! Unisex!",
        "No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.",
        "(entering) Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow.",
        "Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.",
        "All right, then you owe me $350.",
        "(glaring at him) Joey…",
        "Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.",
        "Hi sweetie!",
        "Why?! Why not?!",
        "Okay.",
        "Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.",
        "Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?",
        "What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!",
        "Honey wait, Joey, I’m sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it… (Looks for help.)",
        "…I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.",
        "Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn’t have a bag, I just—it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, (Pause) controversial.",
        "What?!",
        "So?",
        "Oh, good point.",
        "(To Joey) Happy New Year, Joey!",
        "But your divorce isn't even final yet.",
        "Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about.",
        "I don't gossip!",
        "Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?",
        "What? They were like this!",
        "I didn’t! Even when I found out…umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it. (Goes into her room.)",
        "I think they're very nice.",
        "Awful, absolutely awful. (Plus other negative comments from Phoebe and Monica.)",
        "(entering, singing) \"Baddest man in the whole damn town.\"",
        "Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around wondering what to do.)",
        "(entering) Joey, do you have a minute?",
        "Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!",
        "Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!",
        "Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.",
        "Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!",
        "What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?",
        "I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone… (Joey in a childish attempt to not hear what Rachel is about to say, puts his fingers in his ears and starts to scream loudly. Rachel turns and walks out upon seeing that Joey's not gonna listen, and as she exits Chandler walks in and sees Joey in his current state.)",
        "That really is something; that's really cool.",
        "Good luck, honey!",
        "Hey, uh, Joey?",
        "Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?",
        "I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?",
        "(quietly) Yeah. Well. (Pause.) Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?",
        "Yeah!",
        "Do you know something?",
        "I might know something too.",
        "Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know.",
        "Well then I can't tell you what I know.",
        "All right, how about I go over there and I will walk into Chandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually the thing that I think that I know! (Note: Kudos to Ms. Aniston on the delivery of that line. She said it very quickly and didn't screw up a word. Try it yourself, it ain't that easy.)",
        "AND YOU KNOW!!!",
        "Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you known?",
        "Hey!",
        "Ohhh, yeah, me too.",
        "I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.",
        "Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.",
        "Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.",
        "Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom. (Does so.)",
        "What?!",
        "Oh my God!",
        "OH MY GOD!!!",
        "Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!",
        "I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!",
        "Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!",
        "Ohhh!!!",
        "(trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down) HI!! Hi!",
        "Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!",
        "Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.",
        "Joey! Come here! Come here!",
        "Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.",
        "No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. (Joey gasps) Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.",
        "Wh-what do you mean?",
        "Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!",
        "Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.",
        "You don't have any secrets!",
        "(To Phoebe) So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?",
        "Okay.",
        "Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?",
        "Oh.",
        "Okay great, hold on a sec! (She runs to her room and returns carrying a huge bag of laundry.) Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!",
        "Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?",
        "Oh.",
        "What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?",
        "All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.",
        "Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!",
        "Y'know what you should do?",
        "You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.",
        "(To Ross) See?",
        "Yeah, he broke those too.",
        "Hello! (Listens) Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! (To Phoebe) It's Chandler.",
        "Are you kidding?!",
        "I can not believe he would do that to Mon—Whoa! (She stops suddenly and slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey, do they know that we know?",
        "Joey!",
        "Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!",
        "All right. Be sexy.",
        "Oh yeah! (She gasps.) Oh my God! That is our friend! (Monica covers her face.) It's Naked Ross! (Monica turns and buries her face in Chandler's shoulder.)",
        "Show time!",
        "Okay! (She runs to get some.)",
        "(handing her the wine) Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from right here!",
        "Okay? Whoa, wait! (She undoes one button on Phoebe's dress.)",
        "Yeah, oh wait! (She goes for another one.)",
        "Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.",
        "Okay!",
        "(running from the guy's apartment with Joey in tow) Hey, what's-what's going on?!",
        "Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.",
        "Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.",
        "Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.",
        "Okay.",
        "She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!",
        "Aww, Joey, come here. (She takes his hand.) Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?",
        "Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.",
        "Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.",
        "And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.",
        "Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.",
        "Well, because she loves you and because you love her.",
        "Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.",
        "No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.",
        "Not unless different means the same.",
        "Hi! Wow! You look, you look…big.",
        "Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.",
        "Hey! Hey, cute jacket!",
        "Oh! Ow! (Joey motions, \"You see what I mean?!\")",
        "Whoa! (Laughs) Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much. (She punches Katie back.)",
        "Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend! (She retaliates.)",
        "Ohh, you're so sweet! (She kicks Katie in the shin.)",
        "Ohhhh, I cannot look at it! (She doesn't move.)",
        "Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?",
        "(entering from her room) Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!",
        "Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day…",
        "Okay guys, way to wish me luck!",
        "Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric (On the other one.) Sorry.",
        "(laughing nervously) Oh, what a fun office.",
        "Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories…(stops and tries to change directions)…about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.",
        "…and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!",
        "I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!",
        "I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?",
        "Yeah, I can do that.",
        "I would love to!",
        "Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.",
        "Oh great!",
        "Oh that's okay.",
        "Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? (He holds up his pack.) Y'know what, actually… (She takes the one he's smoking and heads over to where Nancy and Kim are standing and laughing.) Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?",
        "Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, \"Wow, those guys are crazy!\" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.",
        "Oh, me too.",
        "(Laughs) Oh, me too.",
        "Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said, y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.",
        "Thanks!",
        "Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.",
        "I did not!",
        "All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!",
        "No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.",
        "I am so on board! (She throws away her recently lit cigarette.)",
        "Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know? (Laughs) Good luck, Rach.",
        "Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!",
        "Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!",
        "Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it! (She grabs their cigarettes and lighters and throws them in the trash.)",
        "Okay then! (She starts rummaging through the trash to find Kim's lighter.)",
        "Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!",
        "Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!",
        "Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?",
        "Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.",
        "Okay. (Starts to walk away.)",
        "(hearing that) Oh man!",
        "What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!",
        "Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean Chandler's birthday is even before mine!",
        "Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.",
        "Oh, okay, not so weird.",
        "(looking at the bill) Uhh, we still need a tip.",
        "A couple of bucks.",
        "Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.",
        "Hey Joey!",
        "(disgusted at Ross's antics) Ugh!",
        "What?! You say that to kids?!!",
        "Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.",
        "Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!",
        "Yeah! (She puts on her coat and turns around and sees Ross is expecting her to help.) (Laughing.) Are you kiddin'?",
        "(Disgustedly she goes and tries to pick up the couch. Much to her amazement, she is successful.) Oh. Oh! I can do it!",
        "Ross!",
        "Ross!",
        "Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.",
        "(To Ross) Fine! (To the salesman) We went out.",
        "Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!",
        "Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?",
        "Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh-oh!",
        "Any chance you think the couch looks good there?",
        "(entering) Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?",
        "(noticing him) What's up Joey?",
        "Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?",
        "Thanks!",
        "I know.",
        "What's up Joe?",
        "Yeah?",
        "(laughing) What are you saying?",
        "Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.",
        "(laughs and pushes the chair back in) Yeah, well, y'know umm… No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!",
        "Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.",
        "(entering) Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.",
        "Well, I brought the next best thing.",
        "Whoa-oh, what's-what's that? (Points.)",
        "Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.",
        "Okay!",
        "Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.",
        "You think?!",
        "I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!",
        "Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?",
        "What?! Why?!",
        "Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!",
        "Good, you guys are all here!",
        "Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!",
        "I know!",
        "Wh-what?!",
        "Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!",
        "Yeah.",
        "O-okay!",
        "Hi.",
        "Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!",
        "No!",
        "Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, \"Well, yeah! If you've got enough life jackets!\" (She starts laughing; Chandler and Joey are not amused.) Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!",
        "(We see a flashback as Rachel describes what happened.) All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me… Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh… (The flashback shows that she kissed him on the cheek.)",
        "Well, I didn't know what else to do!",
        "Thanks Chandler.",
        "I can't believe it! I got a second interview!",
        "What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?",
        "I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause \"Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!\"",
        "Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?",
        "Maybe. I-I don't know—Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!",
        "Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.",
        "Hi!",
        "Thank you.",
        "What?",
        "Excuse me?",
        "(stopping him) Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I (He tries to interrupt and tell her about the ink), hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand s*x from me. I do not want, this job that bad. Good day, sir. (She storms out of his office.)",
        "(entering) Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me!",
        "Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?",
        "Oh. (Realizes.) Ohhhhhhhhh….",
        "Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.",
        "(looks around for the camera) Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.",
        "Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, (She puts her hands on his desk blotter and he moves it. Rachel then doesn't know where to put her hands.) who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted s*x in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. (Suddenly realizes that she said courage twice.) Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against.  So she didn't want to sue him.   Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got (counts them off with her fingers) courage, you got integrity, you got (Pause) courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr…",
        "Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it.",
        "(gasps) Oh! You are?",
        "Really? Oh thank you! Oh… Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?",
        "Okay, well then how about a handshake? (She goes to shake his hand but misses and touches his groin.) Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to touch that—I mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so—Hey! I'll see you Monday! (Exits.)",
        "(laughs) I cannot believe Ross is buying this!",
        "Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.",
        "I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!",
        "No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.",
        "What's going on?",
        "Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.",
        "Hm-mmm.",
        "Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.",
        "Big night!",
        "Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back. (Goes to her room.)",
        "(She enters and hands Phoebe the earring) Here you go. Thank you!",
        "Oh what, you-you want both of them?",
        "Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.",
        "Tell her to wear her own earrings.",
        "Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!",
        "Because I lose her stuff!",
        "Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!",
        "Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!",
        "Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.",
        "But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.",
        "Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!",
        "Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?",
        "Okay that is the one we already have!",
        "(smiling) What?!",
        "(smiling) Yeah.",
        "(smiling) Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.",
        "It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Okay! (Goes to the door.)",
        "Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?",
        "(entering) (To Phoebe) (whispering) Hey!",
        "The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've been looking for these since like last summer. (Puts 'em on.)",
        "Okay, calm down, here they are. (Gives back the sunglasses.)",
        "I don't know, I don't know.",
        "Oh gosh, she's going to kill me.",
        "Ohh that'd be great!",
        "Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too. (Holds out her arms for a hug.)",
        "Your sunglasses?!",
        "Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to… (Ross interrupts and shushes her.)",
        "I'm sorry.",
        "Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes. (She grabs a couple of the old pizza boxes and exits.)",
        "Hey! Hey! (Stops Caitlin) Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?",
        "No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person.",
        "Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.",
        "Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?",
        "(entering) Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.",
        "Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number. (Hands him the slip of paper with the phone number on it.)",
        "Yeah!",
        "I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.",
        "Yay!",
        "Hey!",
        "Ohh, thank God! Finally!",
        "Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.",
        "Great! Thanks!",
        "Okay.",
        "Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?",
        "Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?",
        "No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.",
        "Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?",
        "What?!",
        "Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! (She picks up the 2 pieces and looks at the stand.) Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?! (Looks for a place to hide it and finds a wall sconce and drops the pieces into it and heads into the kitchen as the phone rings.)",
        "Hey! What's up?!",
        "So all we have is ice?",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh. Oh! (Takes a slug of tequila.)",
        "(does Monica's) I know!",
        "What?! We can't do that!",
        "Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn’t give us the right to erase his message!",
        "I don't think he's the one who needs help.",
        "Ugh!",
        "Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen! (She hits a button on the machine.)",
        "Noooooooo!",
        "No, wait. Wait.",
        "No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!",
        "Yeah well unless we tell him.",
        "Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.",
        "Right?",
        "Hey! Hi!",
        "Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!",
        "Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?",
        "What?! What? What happened?!",
        "Yeah!",
        "(gasps) Really?!",
        "Because a car backfired?",
        "Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole \"seizing\" thing but um, Emily called you today.",
        "No, she left a message. (He starts for the machine.) (Stopping him.) But it-it kinda got erased. There's just (Pause) something wrong with your machine.",
        "Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.",
        "Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?",
        "Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because—I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me—not important. The point is, I was right. You're decision. Okay? I was right. (She starts for the door.) (Stops) You're decision.",
        "Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?",
        "Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!",
        "Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.",
        "I mean, look-look today you escaped (Pause) (Not believing it) death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?",
        "Well, there you go!",
        "(laughing) Close call day.",
        "Ohh, honey no problem. Okay. (Gets up.)",
        "Oh?",
        "No. (She heads for the door again.)",
        "Yeah.",
        "(going out the door) Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?",
        "Well, my eye is a little itchy.",
        "Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!",
        "Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor!",
        "(flinches) Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?",
        "(flinches again) Monica! Come on!",
        "(freaks) Ross! Stop it! Come on!",
        "Chandler!",
        "Just stop it! Come on!",
        "(entering from her bedroom) All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh! (She walks by the table and notices that no one is looking and accidentally on purpose knocks over the open cereal box.) Ohhh! No! Look what I did! (She starts walking through the mess. {Also, notice the continuity error in this scene. Note the position of the box and dispersal pattern of the cereal before and after the camera cut.}) Oh, I mean, look at this mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have to reschedule!",
        "Oh my God! What does that thing do?",
        "All right, I'm outta here!",
        "Hey!",
        "So were done then!",
        "Okay.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Okay.",
        "(jerks back from the tester) What?!",
        "All right.",
        "I'm sorry. All right, I'll just stay in here this time. (Puts her head back.) Okay.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay. Okay!",
        "(really excited) Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow! Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy! (He took out that thing they use to look at people's retinas and looked at Rachel's when she was shaking his hand causing her to flinch and scream at him.)",
        "Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.",
        "Great!",
        "Okay, just give me the damn drops! (Grabs them and storms out.)",
        "Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.",
        "Damn!",
        "Bye you guys!",
        "Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the puss.",
        "Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing! (Runs after him.)",
        "Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.",
        "Eh! Stop it!",
        "Okay. (She tilts her head back and squeezes the eyedropper. The only problem is, it's not over her eye.)",
        "Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!",
        "All right!",
        "All right.",
        "Yes!",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay, they are. (No they're not.)",
        "(thinks) Four.",
        "Really?!",
        "Okay!",
        "Great!",
        "Okay.",
        "Well, well, you said it was practice!",
        "Because I knew you were lying!",
        "(as she's being dragged) What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it! (Monica drags her totally onto the floor and on her back.)",
        "Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!",
        "Monica! Stop it!",
        "Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune! (Monica is straddling Rachel and holding her arms down. In a rather risqué pose, at least for primetime TV.)",
        "Yep!",
        "What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!",
        "Oh! (She's trying to recover while still on the floor.)",
        "Well, hello, Mr. Rachel! (Throws some more rice.)",
        "Wait! (Gets her bearings) Okay!",
        "Ohhh! (Looks in the mirror and sees that she still has her mustache and groans.)",
        "I don’t know. Do-do you have any clothes on?",
        "Really?!",
        "Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.",
        "Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I’m just glad we didn’t do anything stupid.",
        "(To Ross) I don’t know. (To the gang.) What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.",
        "(gasps) Who got married?! (Ross is as surprised to hear this as she is.)",
        "No, we didn’t get married! That’s ridiculous!",
        "Oh my God.",
        "No!",
        "Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer? (Looks at Ross.)",
        "Hey, hubby!",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Okay! So, we’ll just stay married.",
        "And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!",
        "Okay, see now I’m scared because I don’t actually think you’re kidding.",
        "What-wh-what so we’ll just stay married forever?!",
        "Ohh, okay, I’m sorry. You’re right. Y’know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you’re asking of me.",
        "You are asking me to be your wife!",
        "Hey!",
        "(thinks about it for a second) No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.",
        "Oh b-b-but it is!",
        "Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world’s worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!",
        "Thank you. (He goes to leave.) Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?",
        "Huh, that’s funny. You look like you’re gonna be the…",
        "All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful. (Exits.)",
        "Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?",
        "Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?",
        "Pheebs?",
        "Okay, umm, I’m gonna get my sweater. (Walks away.)",
        "Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?",
        "No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here.",
        "(under her breath) Sucker!",
        "(entering with Ross) Hi!",
        "Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.",
        "Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.",
        "That sounds great.",
        "Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.",
        "No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.",
        "No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn’t mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.",
        "(takes off her robe) Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} (In her head.) Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen…naked! I'm picking up an orange. (Does so) I'm naked! (Goes into the living room) Lighting the candles, naked, and carefully. (She backs anything that might have a point like a candle on her body away.)",
        "(singing) Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow! (There's a knock on the door, she turns off the music, puts on her robe, and goes to answer the door.) Love to love ya, baby! (There's another knock.) Darnit! (Looks through the peephole and turns on the lights.) Ugh. (She opens the door to Ross who's leaning against the door jam.)",
        "Uh, yeah, if you want too.",
        "Yeah, sure?",
        "And um, what-what is that Ross?",
        "(laughs) What?! Are you crazy?",
        "(gasps) Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!",
        "Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have s*x with you?!",
        "Ohh wow! I’m sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!",
        "Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.",
        "Yes.",
        "Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of \"us?\"",
        "(taking off her sweater) Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.",
        "I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.",
        "No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.",
        "Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.",
        "No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?",
        "Ross! What are you… I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.",
        "(to the flight attendant who appears in record time. It was only seconds after Rachel pushed the call button was she there. Once again, more proof that TV isn't real, IRL she would've been waiting for the rest of the flight and by then Ross's pants would be dry.) Hi!",
        "Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident.",
        "Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent. (Disembarks)",
        "Ahh.",
        "Hello! (She makes a face and the kid laughs harder. Finally, his parents drag him off.) Ohh, kids love me.",
        "Hi! (Hugs Phoebe)",
        "Pancho Vila?",
        "What are you talking about Pheebs? (Takes out her compact) I don't… (She gasps when she looks in the mirror and sees her face.) (To Ross) Oh my God, you drew on me?!",
        "Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! I can—you have so crossed a line. (Heads for the bathroom)",
        "(returning with her purse covering her face) All right, it won't come off!",
        "It won't come off!",
        "No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.",
        "Hi!!",
        "Hi. (She hugs Joey.)",
        "What?! What else did he say?",
        "Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!",
        "Ross, I am a human doodle!!",
        "Okay, I need a, I need a drink! (Makes a beeline for the mini-bar.)",
        "(she's finished reliving the fridge of its entire alcohol content.) Macadamia nut?",
        "Hm-mmm! (Opens the container)",
        "Nope! (She puts one in her mouth and spits it out, then does it again in another direction.)",
        "Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel.",
        "Hit me!",
        "I bet 20.",
        "Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (He does so.) Hit me. (She slows down with each one.)",
        "Yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. Hold on a second. (Gets up but stumbles a little bit.) Whup, okay. (She makes it to the phone and picks it up, without dialing.) Hello! Vegas? Yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? We would like some more beers. Hello? Ohh, I forgot to dial!",
        "Ohh, I love Joey! Joey lives with a duck! (Goes and hugs Joey.)",
        "Hey!",
        "I'm doin' good, baby. How you doin'?",
        "Ohhh!!",
        "Oops! All right, so what do you want to do now?",
        "Okay, y'know what? There's only one way I'm leaving this hotel room.",
        "Good luck to ya!",
        "Wow!",
        "(bowing) Hello!",
        "(bowing) Hello!",
        "Well, hello, Mr. Rachel! (Throws some more rice.)",
        "Wait! (Gets her bearings) Okay!",
        "(entering) Hey, you guys…",
        "Is Monica here?",
        "All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.",
        "Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?",
        "Okay! (She goes and gets her surprise and when she returns with it, Ross stares in shock.) Check it out!",
        "It's a, it's a cat!",
        "Yes it is!",
        "Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!",
        "Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.",
        "A thousand bucks.",
        "All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!",
        "Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. (They both glare at her.) Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Well, it's my cat.",
        "Oh yeah, I got a cat.",
        "You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, \"Rachel!\"",
        "Well, I was gonna let you play with it.",
        "(she's wearing an oven mitt to protect her hand) I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!",
        "I tried! They won't take her back.",
        "Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?",
        "No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand! (Storms out.)",
        "Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat! (A woman approaches.)",
        "It's not a baby! It's a cat!",
        "Oh no! No! It's actually—it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! (Goes to pet it and it hisses at her.) Yeah, do you want it?",
        "Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!",
        "Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?",
        "Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.",
        "Okay, a thousand.",
        "Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.",
        "(makes some unintelligible sound to stop her from leaving) Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! (Covers her eyes) Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away! (Uncovers her eyes and sees that the woman has fled) Damnit! (To the cat) Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! (The cat hisses at her again, it sounds like Rachel) Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?",
        "It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. (Pause) Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson.",
        "Yeah, 15 hundred dollars.",
        "Oh yeah, there you go. (Hands over the pillow.)",
        "Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind. (Turns and walks away.)",
        "Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?",
        "Phoebe, are you okay?",
        "Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?",
        "Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.",
        "No, I meant with the dropper over here. (Points at Chandler.)",
        "Hey, so did everything go okay with the annulment?",
        "Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?",
        "Okay, umm, I’m gonna get my sweater. (Walks away.)",
        "Oh? Yeah! Sure!",
        "Oh but Phoebe, we’re gonna be late for the movie.",
        "Yeah, we’re, we’re actually just gonna walk ‘cause it’s right up there at the Angelica.",
        "(to the driver) Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!",
        "What was that?!",
        "I haven’t seen it yet!",
        "Noooooooo!!",
        "Hey!",
        "Ugh, the worse day! Y’know, you think you’re making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.",
        "I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!",
        "What?",
        "Oh my God! That’s so great! I’m so happy for you guys!",
        "And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!",
        "And Chandler, you’re gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can’t be late.",
        "Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God… (Gasps and starts to sing) Come and knock on my door…",
        "(entering) Hey roomie!",
        "(gasps) Are you pregnant?!",
        "Um-hmm.",
        "(laughs) Oh my God! Oh, that’s funny, I can’t believe I did that.",
        "Okay. (Sits back and resumes her reading.)",
        "Sure? (Monica hands her one.) Thanks.",
        "Monica, where did you get these?!",
        "Ooh, good God, they’re so yummy! (She re-ingests the previously expelled cookie matter from the tissue.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Okay!",
        "Okay.",
        "(grabbing the star) What the hell is that?",
        "Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!",
        "Mon, honey you’re not dying. I’m just moving out. Y’know, I mean we’re gonna see each other all the time.",
        "Are you okay? You’re not blinking.",
        "Oh, all right. But y’know I gotta say, I don’t, I don’t think six years counts as an era.",
        "What is the matter with you?!",
        "All right, fine, but don’t get mad at me. It’s-it’s just a little hard to believe.",
        "Well y’know, it’s you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y’know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I’m not upset because I don’t see you guys going through with it. I’m sorry.",
        "But I…",
        "It is? Really?",
        "(starting to lose her composure) I mean we’re not, we’re not gonna live together anymore?",
        "What? Oh my God! I’m gonna miss you so much! (Starts to cry.)",
        "I mean it’s the end of an era!",
        "Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I cannot believe that you didn’t tell me that we are still married!!",
        "When?! After the birth of our first secret child?! (To All) Ross didn’t get the annulment; we are still married.",
        "So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross’s, and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.",
        "Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.",
        "Well there’s an idea!!",
        "That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?",
        "December 26th, huh maybe she’s Santa Clause.",
        "(deadpan) Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.",
        "Well sure, if you say you’re gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! (Grabs them from him.) All right, now I’m gonna do this my way and I don’t want to hear a peep out of you!",
        "Op! You’re peeping!",
        "Ross! Y’know what, I just got—why? Why did you do this?!",
        "I don’t wanna hear \"Three failed marriages!\"",
        "Well, y’know what? Thanks to you I’m half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross, I don’t think I have ever been this angry!",
        "Ugh! (Stares at him.)",
        "Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.",
        "Uh yes, heroin and crack.",
        "Well, you would know.",
        "(starts to cry) Ross, please, I found the magazines!",
        "Ugh!",
        "Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! (To the stenographer) And could you strike \"Consummated like bunnies\" from the record?",
        "Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.",
        "(stands up as well) What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!",
        "(to the judge) Okay, do you see, do you see what you’re keeping me married too?!",
        "All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!",
        "And thank you for your time. (They both beat a hasty retreat.)",
        "This is totally your fault!",
        "Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter’s machine!!",
        "Don’t call us that! (Storms away)",
        "(deadpan) Oh honey thank God you’re home, I was getting worried.",
        "Oh, little ‘X’s! Great! That makes up for everything!",
        "Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!",
        "Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!",
        "Nothing. (Sits down.)",
        "Uh-hmm. (Just as Rachel finishes signing her name, Ross yanks each page out of the way.)",
        "Okay Ross, we’re—wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession.",
        "Well, y’know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.",
        "Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?",
        "And uh, yeah, I didn’t really, I didn’t want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then (Ross joins in) to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.",
        "Yeah, don’t push it though.",
        "I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn’t be a secret, and we wouldn’t have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut. (They both laugh.)",
        "No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.",
        "Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.",
        "I’m gonna need a copy of those.",
        "(entering from her room) Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.",
        "Well since I’m movin’ out and-and you’re so beautiful…",
        "…how about I move in with you?",
        "You have a roommate?!",
        "Oh, that’s true.",
        "Yeah, yeah I think I’m gonna find my own place.",
        "Pheebs, I have to ask you…",
        "You’re just staring into space.",
        "This one? (Picks it up.)",
        "Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; (Points to one and starts to read it.) \"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly.\" It’s just, there is nothing! The city’s full!",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah! Why?",
        "That sounds great! I’d love to live at Warren’s!! I love Warren! Thank you!",
        "Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! (Jumps up.) Oh, thank you!",
        "(returning from calling Warren) Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I’m never gonna find anything.",
        "What?!",
        "Oh my God! Are you serious?!",
        "I would love to live with you Ross; that’s-that’s great! Thank you!",
        "Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You’re my hero!",
        "Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has! (Kisses him on the cheek and exits.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica’s and she and Chandler had a big fight and they’re not moving in.",
        "No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.",
        "Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I’m also really psyched ‘cause I don’t have to move in here!",
        "No-no, I’m staying put.",
        "Why, where are you going?",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh wow.",
        "Yeah. Y’know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don’t you think it’s gonna be weird?",
        "Well, because of us! Because of our history.",
        "No?",
        "No! Not at all!",
        "Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.",
        "Yeah! I’m gonna have a boyfriend, you’re gonna have a girlfriend…",
        "But y’know what, if you think it’s gonna be okay we’ll just work out a system. Y’know, it’ll be like college, I’ll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, \"Come back later, I’m gettin’ lucky.\" (Laughs.)",
        "Umm, well let’s see Monica and Chandler are occupied.",
        "No, the other thing. I really think it’s great they work things out.",
        "Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?",
        "Thank you. (Gets up) Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there’s no turning back.",
        "All right, well the place was closed. I’ll just copy it later.",
        "Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you’re thinking about Naked Wednesday’s.",
        "(entering from her room) Pheebs, I was wondering…",
        "Well and clearly not a minute sooner.",
        "Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.",
        "Yeah, yeah, I know.",
        "Surprise!!",
        "No, no don’t get mad because look—this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, \"What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!\" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!\nMonica: (grabs a bag of those Styrofoam peanuts) I’ll be coordinator! Oh my God! I’m so sorry, I didn’t get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can’t you Phoebe?",
        "Ohhhhhh, look it’s the roller blades.",
        "You remember when we got these?",
        "I guess you weren’t there. (They hug.)",
        "I’m sorry Pheebs, I guess I’m just really said that I’m leaving.",
        "I have one.",
        "Uh well, I guess I’m not gonna miss the fact that you’re never allowed to move the phone pen. (Laughs. Monica lags behind the laugh a little bit.)",
        "You get your messages!",
        "So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?",
        "Ooh, your brother. Score!",
        "You know what else I’m not gonna miss? \"I’m Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!\"",
        "\"I’m Monica, I don’t get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!\"",
        "\"Oh my God, I can’t find a boyfriend! So I guess I’ll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!\"",
        "I’m unpacking!",
        "I’m not moving! (She re-hangs a picture, crookedly.) Is that picture straight?",
        "Hey, y’know what? You’re the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!",
        "Well it’s mine too! What else you got?!",
        "Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!! (She knocks over Monica, grabs a box, and runs into the kitchen.)",
        "Great! Monica’s moving!",
        "Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?! (Monica starts chasing Rachel around the table.)",
        "Yeah, I’m just mad!",
        "Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.",
        "What?!",
        "Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.",
        "Oh really? Like what Monica?",
        "Oh yeah, good start Mon.",
        "Yeah and you stretch ‘em out with your big old clown feet.",
        "Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.",
        "Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.",
        "Oh, it’s gonna be fine.",
        "But honey, I think she’s moving in with Chandler.",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh! I have your key. Here you go. (Hands it to Monica.)",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh God! This is silly, I’m gonna see you in a couple of hours! (They hug again.)",
        "Bye house!",
        "Bye Mon.",
        "So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?",
        "And?",
        "Look at that!",
        "What?!",
        "No-no, I bought those.",
        "Yeah. (Rachel walks away.)",
        "Well, who wouldn’t?!",
        "And Mrs.?!",
        "What?!!",
        "Ohh! Oh God! (Laughs her way into the living room.)",
        "Yeah honey you don’t believe her do you?",
        "Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?",
        "Some uh, some visual aides.",
        "Hey Pheebs, you’re still alive! How are you doing?",
        "Pheebs, what-what are you doing?",
        "Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we’d lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?",
        "Monica!",
        "Did-did you take these back?",
        "Oh yeah, they’re really great! Aren’t they?",
        "Yeah. (Monica walks away) Nice try! (Rachel puts them in a box.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Wow, that’s great Ross, I’m sorry we weren’t more supportive before.",
        "Well, we’re a little early, the lecture doesn’t end for 15 minutes.",
        "Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There’s some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. (to them) Hey sisters! (They ignore her.) (To Monica) Wow, we really are bitches.",
        "Yeah, and not a very good one.",
        "(in an Indian accent) Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.",
        "No! They are mine!",
        "You stole them from me!!",
        "Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.",
        "Well…",
        "Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’re probably not even listening!",
        "Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you.",
        "Really? Really?!",
        "Okay! (Picks up the phone and starts dialing.) (In an Irish accent) \"Hello Ross, this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University, we’d like you to come on board with us full time! (Hangs up.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Really?! How do you know?",
        "Oh, I’m sorry.",
        "(answering it) Hello?",
        "Uh no, he’s not. Can I take a message?",
        "Ross got married again—Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!",
        "Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!",
        "Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, sure, but they might think it’s kinda weird considering I don’t work there anymore.",
        "I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren.",
        "Yeah. (chuckling) A year ago..",
        "But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn’t see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn’t like me very much.",
        "Sure.",
        "Oh my God. Did you talk to him?",
        "What? What!?! You kissed him?",
        "(Gasps) Phoebe are you serious?",
        "Phoebe, I mean, you do know he’s married?",
        "Phoebe…",
        "Oh, Kim, Hi. (Kim doesn’t even look up from her report.)",
        "So you know, I…I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.",
        "Ahh….So…Wow…The spring line, it’s really going to be great this year, huh?",
        "So I hear the Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room. (Kim stops the elevator and turns to Rachel.)",
        "Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside. (Sitting down on the couch.) You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.",
        "Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just…made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she’d heard all year.",
        "That-that is your make out buddy. Don’t you recognize him? (Holding up the magazine in front of her face.) Oh wait. Ohh, Phoebe I love you. Kiss me please.",
        "What?",
        "Oh My God, Phoebe, that’s not Ralph Lauren. That’s Kenny the copy guy.",
        "Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!",
        "To get you to make out with him!!!",
        "Ohh, hi, Kim.",
        "Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn’t happen.",
        "Okay, two things didn’t happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that’s not true.",
        "No.",
        "Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.",
        "I-I don’t want your job. I-I don’t. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don’t even know how to use my keycard. (The elevator stops. Ralph steps on.)",
        "Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.",
        "I did but she doesn’t think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.",
        "You were with Kenny today, weren’t you?",
        "Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?",
        "I’m not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn’t.",
        "That wouldn’t help me.",
        "Kim, hi.",
        "Okay..Okay.. Look. I’m sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.",
        "(Faking crying.) Yeah, he dumped me. He said, \"Rachel, I can’t do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. I can’t do this. I’m married and I’m sorry.\" And then I don’t know why but he said, \"and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine.\"",
        "Of course it’s true and it hurts so bad.",
        "You and Ralph?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hi...",
        "Rachel...",
        "Phoebe’s...",
        "leave...",
        "Wait, I-I just said \"leave.\"",
        "Phoebe, come on that's silly.",
        "No, I have all of the good words. OK, fine, fine, we can switch.",
        "Okay.",
        "Everybody…",
        "Rachel…",
        "Phoebe’s…",
        "What?",
        "Phoebe, come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go running before it gets dark. Oh! Why don't you come with me?!",
        "Yeah, it'll be fun. We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first y’know roommate bonding thing.",
        "Yeah and there's really cute guys there.",
        "OK!",
        "Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!",
        "Okay. (Runs off.)",
        "You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.",
        "Oh! I used to do that too!",
        "Aw, Mon...(Kisses her on the cheek)",
        "Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.",
        "You're right, you're right. I should just tell her the truth.",
        "Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!",
        "Ankle.",
        "No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!",
        "No, wait Phoebe.",
        "Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?",
        "Okay, um, I...(Phoebe walks into her room.) All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.",
        "Well, I-I should've told you the truth.",
        "Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...(Starts flapping her arms)",
        "Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.",
        "Because they're people.",
        "Yes, but still. They're people…with eyes.",
        "I-I am not uptight—Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.",
        "(Runs into Phoebe.) Hey!",
        "Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!",
        "Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. (Turns and bumps into a mounted policeman and falls) Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry! (Runs off.)",
        "Yeah. Don’t do this to yourself.",
        "I know.",
        "Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! (Grabs the aforementioned catalog and holds the rest back out to Chandler.) You can throw the rest away.",
        "Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered. (Shows her the picture.)",
        "Yeah! It’s an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?",
        "Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!",
        "Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.",
        "Okay fine! I’ll-I’ll just tell her it’s an antique apothecary table, she doesn’t have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.",
        "Hey!",
        "Guess!",
        "Ha! See, I knew, I knew you’d get it on the first guess. Isn’t it cool! It’s an apothecary table.",
        "Ohh, yes.",
        "Almost.",
        "It was only 500 bucks.",
        "Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was new, y’know like back then.",
        "Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y’know, it was like a dollar.",
        "And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Uh, it’s from yore. Like the days of yore. Y’know?",
        "Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.",
        "Hey! We’re here!",
        "(seeing his new table) Ohh! Oh my God!",
        "Oh no!",
        "Ross! Phoebe’s gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!",
        "I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she’s gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.",
        "Because she hates Pottery Barn.",
        "I know! I know, she says it’s all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. (Ross looks at his table.) So come on, she’s gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?",
        "Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!",
        "Ross, get over it! It’s not like she hates you.",
        "Ross, she’s not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.",
        "Hey!",
        "Ooh, Phoebe’s here! Okay, let’s turn out all the lights and we’ll just watch the movie!",
        "He got it a flea market!",
        "That’s funny. (Phoebe puts her feet up on Ross’s table.)",
        "Ohh!!",
        "Noooooo!! (Phoebe lifts up the sheet to discover the exact same apothecary table they have.)",
        "Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!",
        "Oh yes.",
        "…see I can’t decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.",
        "I know, I know. I went a little crazy.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.",
        "Well there’s yore. And uh, y’know, yesteryear.",
        "Oh honey he doesn’t need my help.",
        "(not sure of what to do) Y’know what? I don’t, I don’t think Phoebe really wants to come.",
        "Oh, she does want to.",
        "Pheebs, I don’t know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, y’know what? Don’t look at it. (Realizes the display is their living room) Seriously, don’t look at it. (Tries to pull Phoebe away.)",
        "Ugh, those bastards! Let’s go.",
        "No! No! No! No it’s not! No it’s not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don’t have the… (Looks desperately for something different.) We don’t have the…that lamp! And-and that screen is y’know, on the other side.",
        "Okay! Okay-okay look—no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just… Come on don’t be mad.",
        "Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.",
        "What?! No! I’m not gonna move out!",
        "(gets it) Oh. Yes! I would so move out!",
        "That’s right!",
        "That’s a good story, Grandpa.",
        "So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.",
        "Well, I used to date him, but you’re still going out with her!",
        "Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I’m sorry, but I don’t think that was a romantic thing.",
        "Well, that’s a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.",
        "Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.",
        "We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.",
        "Don’t worry, we’re just gonna search here for an hour, them we’re gonna go over to Joey’s and search, OK?",
        "Chandler, aren’t you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?",
        "Chandler, that’s not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you’ve just gotten her one great present? I mean that’s just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?",
        "That’s right!",
        "Oh, it’s a Macy’s bag!",
        "(Reading) Dear losers, do you really think I’d hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they’d break you.",
        "We are so gonna find them this year.",
        "Yeah.",
        "No, we never do that",
        "Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.",
        "Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?",
        "Ha!",
        "Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!",
        "Hey, this is hollow.",
        "This bench, it’s hollow! I can’t believe I never knew that! (She pushes all the pillows off it and opens it up) Oh, the presents!!!",
        "Oh, this one’s for me!",
        "Ooh, let’s open them!",
        "Why?",
        "Whatever Linus, I’m opening mine.",
        "Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?",
        "‘Cos I was gonna say there’s no way you could’ve done the end the way you guys did it back then!",
        "Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to make a traditional English trifle!",
        "(worried) Nothing?",
        "So, if-if I mess this up, there’s nothing else for dessert?",
        "Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter’s done?",
        "Her dancer friends?",
        "Really?!",
        "I dunno. Y’know to me he’ll always be “Jack Geller, walks in while you’re changing.”",
        "(looking at her trifle) Look at it, isn’t it beautiful?",
        "It’s a trifle. It’s got all of these layers. First there’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something’s wrong.] then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!",
        "The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y’know, I thought “well, there’s mincemeat pie,” I mean that’s an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y’know. [To Joey] Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?",
        "(teasingly) And while I’m gone don’t you boys sneak a taste.",
        "Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!",
        "No!",
        "Yeah?",
        "(sarcastically) No, I did, but tell me again, because it’s so romantic.",
        "Joey! Come on! I don’t wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like “Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?”",
        "So why don’t you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?",
        "Okay...",
        "What’s up, Ross?",
        "Yeah!",
        "Oh no. No Ross, don’t do this.",
        "I just- I don’t think us getting back together is a good idea.",
        "I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y’know? And it’s probably really hard for you to be alone right now.",
        "No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you’re [pity-tone] alone, alone. And I just-it’s just not the time for us. I’m sorry.",
        "Joey, you’re gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don’t get any dessert.",
        "No, I’m just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it’s trifle time!",
        "It sure is.",
        "Beef.",
        "Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.",
        "Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!",
        "Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.",
        "Well?",
        "Really? How good?",
        "Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.",
        "...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?",
        "Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?",
        "(humoring Phoebe) Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!",
        "(reading the recipe magazine, finally figuring out that...) I wasn’t supposed to put beef in the trifle!",
        "You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn’t feel bad!",
        "I’m sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny. (Ross grabs the magazine away from her.)",
        "We are looking at a Playboy.",
        "Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she’s crying out, ‘Where are they, where are they?’",
        "You see, now, I would date this girl. She’s cute, she’s outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that’s got to come in handy",
        "(thinks) I don’t know.",
        "Hey.",
        "Monica, what are you doing?",
        "(To Monica) Well, people are different.",
        "What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I’m a pushover? I’m not a pushover.",
        "Oh my … you think I’m a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You’re not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that’s pretty strong, that’s what I think. Come on, Monica, let’s go to lunch. (She leaves)",
        "I cannot believe her.",
        "Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.",
        "All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.",
        "No.",
        "Joey, honey, I don’t think you’re supposed to go back there.",
        "Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.",
        "Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. (Joey nods.) A smile goes a long way. (Joey smiles) And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.",
        "Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.",
        "Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.",
        "So, what, you’re just, you’re just okay with being flaky?",
        "Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.",
        "I am not a pushover!",
        "You did!",
        "Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I’ve ever heard.",
        "How-how did you lose your job here?",
        "He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you’ve been working here two days? That’s not, that’s not right.",
        "Joey, you can’t let him get away with that. Ya know what, I’m not going to let him get away with that. I’m going to say something to him—No, I really shouldn’t say anything—No, I should say something to him. (Goes to the counter) Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him…",
        "What?",
        "That’s right, he can have his job back. I’m glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.",
        "Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who’s a pushover?",
        "Oh, I’m sorry. (Gets up and moves.)",
        "Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.",
        "Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?",
        "What’s the matter?",
        "(less than enthused) Great.",
        "So what-what is the exhibit.",
        "Hi!",
        "I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.",
        "Umm.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Ooh, the gift shop!",
        "Oh, wait yes, but I can’t eat too much. Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.",
        "What?! No! Why?!",
        "I didn’t know you could get married here.",
        "Oh sorry didn’t mean to interrupt. It’s just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?",
        "Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list",
        "Yeah hon, it can’t hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you’re not engaged you just don’t use it.",
        "I’m gonna do it too!",
        "Really? Who would, who would you marry?",
        "Oh Pheebs.",
        "(from another room) Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.",
        "It’s so secluded up here.",
        "I feel like we’re the only two people in the world. (She sets down her wine class, picks up a walnut, and knocks another one on the floor.) Oops. Sorry. (She reaches down to pick it up and Ross hands it to her. Ross is hiding under the couch and causes Rachel to scream.)",
        "No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I—would you—actually, would you go check on that?",
        "Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?",
        "Okay. (After Paul leaves Rachel drops to the floor to confront Ross.) What?! What are you doing here?!",
        "I came with Paul!",
        "Get up!",
        "Ahh. Thank you!",
        "Op, ice. I need ice.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on! (Ross gets up and heads for the kitchen.) No! Not in there! He’s in there! (She points Ross to the door next to the kitchen.)",
        "Go-go!",
        "Ohh, thank you.",
        "Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.",
        "Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?",
        "Well, why do y’know go in that room (points to the room Ross is in) and do your homework?",
        "That’s your, that’s your dad’s bedroom. (Yelling) That’s your dad’s bedroom!",
        "Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!",
        "Really? Okay. Okay, I-I’ll go upstairs. (to Paul) If-if you get me something from the car.",
        "Surprise me.",
        "(yelling) So you’re gonna be in the car, I will be upstairs, and that’s where everybody’s gonna be!",
        "(yelling from the living room) Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don’t go in there! Don’t go in there! I need another soda!",
        "Oh my God Ross! What in heaven’s name are you doing here?",
        "Who wrote it?",
        "Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?",
        "(entering from the bathroom) Hey Mon? I’m gonna check my messages.",
        "(on phone) Hello? (Shocked that someone answered.) Uh, Rachel. (To the gang.) Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!",
        "(on phone) Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! (Hangs up) That was the fire department, there was a fire at our place!",
        "Well, he didn’t say, but it was a fire. I’m guessing not very good. Come on, we gotta go!",
        "My God! (They both run into the bedrooms.)",
        "Everything’s ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater. (Hold it up.)",
        "Fine! I’m sorry for your loss! (Hands it back to her.)",
        "(stands up) Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.",
        "Okay Phoebe calm down, there’s no need to place blame. Okay? (To the fireman) I warned her about those candles.",
        "Oh my God! It sure didn’t look this way when I lived here.",
        "Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one’s fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.",
        "Okay! (She jumps on the bed.)",
        "I have.",
        "I did.",
        "I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.",
        "What?",
        "Well, don’t look at me! My hair’s straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!",
        "Oh.",
        "Oh, Joey! Sorry!",
        "Oh but look! That’s gonna leave a stain!",
        "Really?",
        "I’ve never lived like this before.",
        "I love it at Joey’s!",
        "Thanks!",
        "Hi!",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y’know what? I’m fine here.",
        "No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don’t want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!",
        "I know. I’m sorry.",
        "Wait a minute, you’re only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?",
        "Honey, no one thinks you’re a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue. (She notices something hanging from Monica’s nose, as does Joey.)",
        "Oh my God, Jill!",
        "This is Chandler. (Points at him.)",
        "And you know Monica and Ross!",
        "And that’s Phoebe (points), and that’s Joey.",
        "Don’t!! (Joey backs away frightened.) (To Jill) Honey, what are you doing here?!",
        "Wow! What did he say?",
        "Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad’s proud of me! My dad’s proud of me.",
        "Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?",
        "Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could’ve ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I’m the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you’re gonna do. You’re gonna get a job, you’re gonna get an apartment, and then I’ll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?",
        "(entering) Hey! What’s goin’ on?",
        "(notices Jill’s bags) Jill! Did you shop?!",
        "You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jill’s nose when you know she’s trying to quit. Wow, you guys are terrible!",
        "What’d you get?",
        "Oh.",
        "Apartment pants?",
        "No, of course, of course I’ve heard of them! Ross, what did you get?",
        "A pajmena?",
        "Really?",
        "Jill?",
        "Oh, come on! You think that’s gonna work on me?! I invented that!",
        "All right, it’s okay. One little setback is okay, just don’t let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But I’m just gonna take the-the pajmena. (Ross hands it to her.) And the uh, and the uh pants. Y’know what, I’m just gonna take it all away, ‘cause that way you’ll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, I’m gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner. (Leaves with all of Jill’s stuff.)",
        "Hey!",
        "What’s up?!",
        "Well, it’d better not be about the apartment pants, because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.",
        "What?!",
        "With Ross and Jill?",
        "With Ross and my sister?",
        "With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?",
        "Oh there is no way.",
        "Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don’t really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn’t that like incest or something?! Oh my God, and they’re gonna have s*x! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can’t stop it! I can’t—I don’t own Ross! Y’know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God, I can’t believe Ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me.",
        "(on the couch) Oh hi! Y’know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.",
        "That is great. Hey, y’know who doesn’t have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university.",
        "Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you’re gonna go out?",
        "I just, Phoebe, said y’know thought she saw something between you guys.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross?",
        "Are-are you saying he’s a geek?",
        "No! No I, no Ross is not a geek!",
        "What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren’t on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!",
        "Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that’s not what I meant.",
        "Yeah but, he’s not your type.",
        "Yeah but, you don’t, you don’t, you don’t want to try to much too fast. Y’know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don’t you?",
        "She-she died Jill.",
        "Hi!",
        "Well yeah…",
        "Really?!",
        "Oh so-so not really never.",
        "Hi! Wh-what are you doing here?",
        "Well, I-I don’t like it.",
        "It’s kinda slutty.",
        "Yeah well, I’m-I’m a slut.",
        "Rachel.",
        "Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it’s not!",
        "Why aren’t you home yet?!",
        "Oh yes, it’s me! Sorry!",
        "Uh, I’m just, I’m just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?",
        "(gasps) Oh, he brought her back to his apartment.",
        "Ugh, she is a slut!",
        "Oh my God, look-look he’s taking off her clothes!",
        "Oh, this is just terrible.",
        "Oh. (Squeaks again.)",
        "Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!",
        "Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.",
        "Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.",
        "Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad? (Giggles.) God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?",
        "Merrill Lynch?",
        "Well why didn’t you take the job?",
        "(gasps) Rob Tillman!",
        "Oh, I’m sorry. Ross Tillman.",
        "Ohh, of course Monica’s brother!",
        "Wow! How are you?!",
        "Ohh! Me too!",
        "Oh, it’s the best! (They both exhale contemplating the joys of marriage.) So, umm how’s Monica?",
        "Ohh, I would love too.",
        "Ohh! Okay!",
        "Oh wait, don’t you have to pay for your, (looks at his magazine) Busty Ladies?",
        "(laughs) Oh yeah? Okay.",
        "But! Don’t you have to give him his money back?",
        "Ohh, so do you! Did you lose weight? (She’s not quite sure of that one.)",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "Oh yeah. Right. So now, are—do you, do you still do music?",
        "(interrupting him and seeing Joey) Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here!",
        "(stunned) You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?",
        "He’s coming over! He’s coming over!",
        "(giggles and can’t look at him) Hi!",
        "(still not quite able to look at him) Hi! I love you on that show! I watch you everyday! I mean, when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even though she tired to kill you…",
        "Ah!",
        "Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?",
        "Hey!",
        "(laughs) Wow! Umm, y’know, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldn’t.",
        "(awestruck, then not) Isn’t that a line from the show?!",
        "That’s a line from the show too!",
        "Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.",
        "(mouthing it to him) Yes, you did.",
        "Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?",
        "Ohh! And I’m one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!",
        "Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y’know I just wish we could be like on a break!",
        "Oh, it’s so easy for you I mean, you’re not married, you get to have s*x with who ever you want!",
        "Monica. You’ve, you’ve done it right?",
        "Oh my God! You’re a 30 year old virgin!",
        "Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you’ve waited long enough!!",
        "Yes!! I mean s*x does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn’t be all this rules and restrictions! Y’know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever…",
        "Oh what do you know? Virgin!",
        "(very relived) Oh! Thank God!",
        "Okay! (She picks up the phone, Joey’s phone number, and starts to dial.) Here we go! Okay! (On phone.) Hi, Joey! It’s Rachel! Umm, I am free tomorrow night. Yeah, sure, sure I can bring some sandwiches.",
        "Ohh, I mean it’s just so realistic!",
        "Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!! (Laughs and finishes her drink.)",
        "Oh, I probably shouldn’t—so I will! (Joey starts making her refill and Rachel notices that rain thing Joey has.) Oh! Wow! It’s like it’s raining!",
        "Umm, can I use your bathroom?",
        "Okay. (Starts to go.) God y’know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani’s apartment…",
        "Yeah, it sure is!",
        "Joey, you’re such an amazing actor! (He smiles.) How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?",
        "Wow! Tell me something Joey—(She falls off the couch)—Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.",
        "Okay. (She climbs back onto the couch.)",
        "Yeah?",
        "Wow! I can’t, I can’t feel my hands.",
        "(wakes up suddenly and realizes where she is) Oh right.",
        "(groans) Oh God. Oh I can’t believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!",
        "Noo! Oh God we did—we didn’t, we didn’t uhh…",
        "God I’m just a horrible person.",
        "Because I’m married. That’s right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star’s apartment to have an affair! Uck!",
        "Yeah and I’m a horrible, horrible person.",
        "The ring from the cave, yeah.",
        "(seeing the ring and gasping) Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!",
        "No! No-no-no…",
        "But I thought that ring stood for Caprice’s undying love for her brother.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Ohh! My God! Barry!!",
        "Oh that’s right! I’m sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!",
        "Hi Ross!",
        "Is Joey Tribbiani here?",
        "Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I’m looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!",
        "Me? I’m great! I’m fine! I’m sooo good!! But, you know who’s not great?! Men! You’re a man right Ross?!",
        "Sit down!",
        "Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you we’re going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor’s dog walker?!",
        "No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?",
        "Aw what are you?! A detective?",
        "Oh. (Doesn’t believe it.)",
        "Who are these men?",
        "Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is (whispers) gay.",
        "Good day for married people huh?",
        "I’m sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren’t that great either.",
        "Hi Joey, how ya doin’?",
        "Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.",
        "I’m not paying for half of that! I’m only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.",
        "That refrigerators don’t live as long as people.",
        "You’re jokin’ right?",
        "Thank God you’re pretty. (Exits.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Do you guys know any cute guys?",
        "Anyway, there’s this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go…",
        "I don’t know, something either trees or disease—Ralph mumbles a lot.",
        "Yeah! It’s weird. But the thing is need to find a date.",
        "Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux.",
        "Oo! When’s her birthday?!",
        "Well, y’know it’s just been so long since I’ve been to Chuckie Cheese.",
        "Hey! You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian.",
        "We just uh, we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field & Stream. (Chandler’s shocked.) What? I read that.",
        "Oh yes! Thank you! (He does so and Rachel sits down on the couch.)",
        "(shocked) What?",
        "You found me a guy?",
        "Well, y’know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I’m just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.",
        "Oh, thank you.",
        "What are you guys doing?",
        "Oh, but y’know, no, you didn’t give me your phone number.",
        "I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!",
        "All right.",
        "Yes, I’ll meet ‘em.",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh…",
        "I don’t know. I know I don’t work late tomorrow night.",
        "What?",
        "Well-well a little blind sided but y’know good.",
        "I—Ohh! (Moves over and lets Eldad sit on the couch.)",
        "Yeah?",
        "Oh, hi.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Oh-okay, but Pheebs?",
        "I’m just sort of in the middle of something.",
        "Okay, y’know what? Maybe I should go!",
        "Yeah, I’m good.",
        "No-no! Don’t dance for me! Please? Don’t! (She gets up to yell at her ‘friends.’) What is the matter with you guys?",
        "I… Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?",
        "I’ll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It’s you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!",
        "I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean (To Patrick) congratulations on all the cash, (He nods) and-and y’know—(Feels Eldad’s hair)—Wow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye! (Grabs her stuff, starts to leave, then turns back suddenly, and to Eldad) Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!",
        "Thank you! (Storms out.)",
        "Oh that’s all right! Y’know, I ended up having a really good time. Y’know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.",
        "I wanna say a disease.",
        "Huh. All right.",
        "Oh-oh Professor Geller.",
        "Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!",
        "Yeah!",
        "What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there (points) and pretend you’re a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!!",
        "Isn’t that a kind of sushi?",
        "Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!",
        "(To Phoebe) Ooh! Y’know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.",
        "Well, Valentine’s Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn’t get her a calendar!",
        "Aw, I love that.",
        "(interrupting him) Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun.",
        "Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!",
        "What the hell was that?!",
        "All right, so we weren’t prepared!",
        "DANGER!!!!!",
        "Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll. (She does the finger thing.)",
        "Yep!",
        "Oh, of course!",
        "Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host, who’s ass I cannot kick.",
        "Say it!",
        "Say it!",
        "I don’t like sitting up here! I’m just gonna over… (She starts to get up.)",
        "Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!",
        "I… Well, I don’t think they need any help.",
        "Good. Although y’know, he-he’s a private guy. Y’know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.",
        "So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?",
        "Hi!",
        "(To Phoebe) Okay.",
        "Okay. (Gets up and starts to leave with Paul.)",
        "Yeah that’s great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day.",
        "Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?",
        "Yeah that’s great Paul, but y’know I wanna know what—(Puts her hands on his shoulders)—Wow, those are really great! I just wanna know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y’know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.",
        "No Paul, I don’t know anything about you! Y’know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!",
        "Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that’s always a painful time! Y’know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you’re sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.",
        "Well, you’re lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm… The rest of you life, y’know? Any regrets?",
        "All right Paul, I’m not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!",
        "Okay.",
        "All right.",
        "Hm-mmm.",
        "That’s-that’s great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let’s go. (Gets up to leave, but Paul doesn’t move.)",
        "Oh!",
        "Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y’know, you shared your feelings. It’s really, it’s beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?",
        "What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!",
        "My God, I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to do that! I wouldn’t do that!",
        "Oh my God! Oh my God!!",
        "Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn’t know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!",
        "What’s the other one?",
        "Oh that’s right. You’re the talker. (They both reflect on that briefly) Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.",
        "No you don’t!",
        "Hi. I’m back.",
        "Ah that’s great. No actually that’s… (In a sexy voice) That’s great! That’s really great! Y’know, I gotta tell ya writing, I mean writing, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot.",
        "A lover?",
        "Oh yeah surfer?",
        "Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, (sits on the counter and buttons her sweater to show some cleavage) get a little more comfortable here. Wait, now wait a second, this isn’t too revealing is it?",
        "I don’t care about the little dude! I can’t! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y’know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it’s only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could’ve made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!",
        "Oh… I’m sorry. I… I-I don’t mean—I didn’t mean to stifle you. I… This is all just a little overwhelming.",
        "I’m so glad, I’m so glad you shared. (Feeling his shoulder.) And I’m glad that you’re done. What do you say we umm… (Nods in the direction of the bedroom.)",
        "(who has just entered) Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby, I’ll dump you too!",
        "Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! (Hugs him.) You guys are gonna be so happy!",
        "(gasps) Nice! One and a half carat easy.",
        "So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.",
        "Huh—Wait so Joey if you get this, you’re gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean you’ll be like the Big Cheese! (To Phoebe) Or the Big Mac—Hey! You love those!",
        "Joey, what are you talking about? You’re a terrific actor.",
        "Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!",
        " I'm sorry, what?",
        " (on the phone) Monica, I’m quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn’t even buy it! (Pause) I’m telling you I’m quitting! That’s it! I’m talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes I am! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. (Hangs up.)",
        "Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!",
        "Already? That’s pretty bad what you did.",
        "I’m sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there! Y’know, you fight, you make up, it’s just the way it works.",
        "Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!",
        "What?!!",
        "(mocking him) You fell asleep?!",
        "Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!",
        "And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!",
        "That is the most ridiculous...",
        "I did not sell you out.",
        "Would you let me talk. [flicks Monica on the forehead]",
        "OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- [Monica flicks her back] Ow. That hurt [flicks Monica]",
        "Ow! Ow! Ow!",
        "Fine!",
        "Okay, Chandler!",
        "And your horoscope says, \"On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift.\"",
        "Op, but the twelfth brings a lover’s spat.",
        "Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.",
        "(ecstatic) Oh my God! It’s Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!",
        "Be-because the last one was such a big seller?",
        "Hey!",
        "(To Phoebe) We do?",
        "Okay.",
        "Hi, I’m sorry I’m late but I am ready, ready to talk you up! When does Liz’s father get here?",
        "Oh! Ross is sooo great!",
        "(seeing him) Oh hi!",
        "Oh! Well let’s look for them. (Finds some under one of the couch cushions. It has a pink, fuzzy ball on the key chain.) Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?",
        "All right! (Throws them back under the cushion.)",
        "Oh good.",
        "(chasing after him) Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?",
        "Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.",
        "You just don’t look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.",
        "Oh. We?",
        "Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just—I meant y’know are you still a ‘We’ or are you just ‘You?’",
        "(sympathetic) Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?",
        "Ohh. (She touches his arm for support and likes what she feels) Ooh!",
        "I was just getting him to like you.",
        "Ross, Joey is not here.",
        "Ross, it’s okay. You can come out.",
        "Bye!",
        "Well, y’know he lost his keys so he was looking for them…",
        "No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y’know, for like two hours, and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.",
        "Ross, what’s the big deal? So I kissed the guy!",
        "Wh—You dated my sister!",
        "What? Why?!",
        "Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let’s face it, so far the guy’s not lovin’ ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner, y’know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer!",
        "Oh it’s important!",
        "So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.",
        "Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I’m gonna go to the bathroom.",
        "Oh we were, but that was just a (pause as the audience reacts), I mean that was just a big drunken mistake.",
        "Oh! Whoops! I’m sorry, you were talking about Emily!",
        "I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.",
        "Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn’t tell me. (Everyone looks at her, Ross not happily.) Maybe I have to pee again. (Gets up to try to use the bathroom.)",
        "(returning) Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!",
        "Oh! I’ve got a lot of those too!",
        "Yeah? Well, you should know. You’ve bought like a billion of ‘em.",
        "Ohh…",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica? Chandler?",
        "Oh my God, I’m so sorry.",
        "How about you guys? (Points to Phoebe and Joey.)",
        "I think so.",
        "Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?",
        "See? Now, he could date her.",
        "(breaking up) We’re just really…very excited about this charity event that we have to go to.",
        "Oh! Thank you!",
        "Uh well, uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.",
        "(suddenly worried) Uh, wh-why?",
        "Oh, hi!",
        "Someone? I brought people. Mr. Thompson, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, this is Mr. Thompson. (She introduces them.) He’s the head of my department.",
        "And I also brought my friend Joey…",
        "Well, y’know I-I don’t know where he is.",
        "Well, y’know what? Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip to Paris.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Thank you. (Mr. Thompson walks away and after he’s left.) Okay, (writing her bid down) twenty dollars.",
        "Ugh! So close!",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Well now it’s an empty bar.",
        "What?! What?! What?!",
        "Joey! It is an auction! You don’t guess, you buy!",
        "Joey! Sit down! (Pulls him down.)",
        "What were you thinking?!",
        "Wh?!",
        "Why would a charity give away a free boat?!",
        "Ugh!",
        "Phoebe, don’t you think you’ve had enough to drink?",
        "How is you drinking helping the kids?",
        "Joey! Joey, good one! (Mr. Thompson starts to laugh.)",
        "(stopping him) Hey! You…can’t…leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!",
        "I know. Okay. (Whispering and thinking.) Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we’re gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you’re just gonna pay the difference.",
        "Okay.",
        "Not great.",
        "Oh great!",
        "(To Phoebe) Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?",
        "Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000.",
        "(To Joey) Okay. Okay. (Shushes him.)",
        "Ohh…",
        "Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife’s name?",
        "Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, \"The Pam.\"",
        "Okay, uh-uh imagine this, \"The Mr. Bowmont.\"",
        "Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. (She sits down next to him.) All right, you are settin’ sail up the Hudson! You’ve got the wind in your h—(sees that he’s bald)—arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that you’ve always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin’! You can—ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you’re old, Cappy.",
        "(To Joey) What?! What?!",
        "But Joey you don’t have $20,000!",
        "(entering) Hey! (Sees Monica, gasps, and runs over to her.) Oh my God you’re here, let me see your hand!!",
        "Isn’t it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin’ married.",
        "Ohh… I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?",
        "No! I’m so happy for them!",
        "I’m so happy and not at all jealous.",
        "I mean I’m probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what’s 2%? That’s nothing.",
        "Yeah me too.",
        "(staring at him) Wh—no, but y’know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.",
        "We’re gonna find love!",
        "Yeah, I’m pretty confident about that. That’s what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.",
        "Well y’know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they’re 40, they marry each other.",
        "Exactly!",
        "You do?",
        "Who?",
        "Joey?!",
        "Are you serious?!",
        "Wh… So… If neither of you are married by the time you’re 40, you’re gonna marry Joey.",
        "Oh, seriously?",
        "Charming.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hey you!",
        "Oh thank you. Hey y’know, I’m so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.",
        "Yeah, love. It’s a tricky business isn’t it?",
        "So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we’re 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we’ve-we’ve already slept together so y’know there’ll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, \"What’s that?!\"",
        "Exactly.",
        "What? Who?",
        "Phoebe?! Wait a—but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.",
        "Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!",
        "Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!",
        "What?!",
        "Phoebe you can’t have both of them! You have to pick one!",
        "Oh God, Phoebe!",
        "Oh.",
        "Okay, y’know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here, this is what we’re gonna do! I’m gonna write Joey on one napkin (does so) and I’m gonna right Ross on the other napkin (does so) and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?",
        "Pick one.",
        "You’re welcome.",
        "(reading) Joey! (Pause) We should just switch.",
        "Ohhh, this is the least jealous I’ve ever been!",
        "Oh hell, he’s done this three times! He knows what its about!",
        "Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she’s even had time to…",
        "(To Monica) Yeah, you’re on your own.",
        "Okay.",
        "Hey!",
        "(quietly) Oh, thanks.",
        "I don’t know, y’know? I feel a little umm… No, y’know what? Never mind, I’m gonna be fine.",
        "Hi!",
        "Well thank you, you too.",
        "Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?",
        "Oh…",
        "Yeah, I guess. I-I… I mean, do-do you think we’re ever gonna have that?",
        "Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.",
        "Shake it off.",
        "No, absolutely. Y’know like it was umm…",
        "Yeah, just give me a minute! (Thinking) Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing.",
        "Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.",
        "Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Oh, I know. Hey, y’know what we never did? (Ross looks at her.) Oh no, not that. (Ross nods okay.) We uh, we never had a bonus night!",
        "Y’know, bonus night. Y’know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.",
        "Yeah-yeah, we never had that,",
        "What?",
        "Oh honey, but it is just about…",
        "What?!",
        "Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!",
        "Honey I swear it we just kissed.",
        "Okay come on Phoebe, it’s nothing! Monica, come on!",
        "No!",
        "No-no, it’s really not huge.",
        "Joey, you are not! You’re 31.",
        "Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look…",
        "Hey.",
        "What do you think Monica meant when she said she didn’t want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.",
        "Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? (Mimicking Monica.) Especially you!",
        "I care!",
        "Y’know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?",
        "Am I going to let you watch me undress?",
        "Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn’t want to talk to anyone, especially me?",
        "No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?",
        "What?!",
        "Monica, what are you talking about?",
        "Monica, y’know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!",
        "Oh!!",
        "Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.",
        "Ugh, Monica I don’t want to steal your stupid thunder!",
        "All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain’t gonna happen!",
        "I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!",
        "(ignoring them) Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?",
        "Oh wow. That—y’know what? That is so unfair. Y’know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let’s go have s*x!",
        "We’re not gonna do this, all right? She’s just gonna think that we’re doin’ it.",
        "Who is it?",
        "Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute! (Motions for him to follow her lead, but he angrily shakes his head no. So she pokes him.)",
        "Yeah, you like that baby? (Monica bursts in followed by Chandler.) May we help you?",
        "All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!",
        "No you don’t know why!",
        "Because! Because I was sad.",
        "Look, I am so…so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I’m not. I’m not even close. And I don’t know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that’s dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!",
        "Anyway sweetie, I am, I’m so sorry I ruined your night.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, so let’s get started on the wedding plans!",
        "Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music…",
        "Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks…",
        "Okay.",
        "Aw.",
        "What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!",
        "Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!",
        "What?!",
        "Now Joey, what did the duck do?!",
        "Hey Joey, what ‘cha doing?",
        "No.",
        "Joey, did you eat my face cream?",
        "Joey, (nervously) where did you learn that word?",
        "(gasps) You found my book?!",
        "Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!",
        "Hey-hey, y’know what? I don’t care! I’m not ashamed of my book. There’s nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a little…erotica. It’s just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand. (She goes into her room.)",
        "Well what happened at dinner?",
        "Wait, but there’s no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!",
        "No, y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. I mean you don’t have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y’know? And-and you don’t need, you don’t need this custom-made, empire-waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack. (She starts to cry, as does Monica.)",
        "Do you even understand what off the rack means?!",
        "Well what?! How-how much is it?!",
        "Ohh! (Whispers.) Really?!",
        "(starting to cry) Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.",
        "(quietly) Joey.",
        "Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.",
        "Well no, I don’t smell anything.",
        "Nothing!",
        "Y’know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!",
        "Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you. (Exits.)",
        "Who are you supposed to be?",
        "Do you even know what a vicar is?",
        "(sarcastically) Yeah. Look Joey, it’s enough alright?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it’s—I’m not—it’s just not funny anymore!",
        "All right! Y’know what? That’s it! You wanna do it?! Let’s do it!",
        "(starting to move closer to him) That’s right, I wanna do it with you! I’ve been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.",
        "(moves the stool out of the way) Yeah! Ohh, I’ve been waitin’ so long to get on that body!",
        "Yeah that’s right! Come on Joey; s*x me up!",
        "Oh, come on now, don’t keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you’re in for a rough ride! (He backs into the door.)",
        "That’s nice.",
        "Well that was umm…Okay.",
        "Ohh no you don’t! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine!",
        "What are you gonna do Pheebs?",
        "(entering, excitedly) Oh! Hi you guys, oh my God! You’ll never gonna believe what happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and…",
        "Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!",
        "Okay, so anyway I’m sittin’ in my office and guess who walks in.",
        "Joey!",
        "Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. (To Monica and Phoebe) It was Ralph Lauren! (Monica and Phoebe gasp) Ralph Lauren walked into my office!",
        "It’s the same story.",
        "(ignoring him) Anyway, Ralph just came in to tell me that he’s so happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail.",
        "Yeah!",
        "I got—I get a big pay raise!",
        "I get to hire my own assistant!",
        "(reading the resume) And you were at this job for four years?",
        "Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay?",
        "I’ve never interviewed anyone before. I’ve actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn’t the same thing.",
        "No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in, it was nice to meet you.",
        "All right. (Hilda exits) I’m a total pro!",
        "(seeing him) Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I’m sorry the models are actually down the hall.",
        "Really?! (Taking his resume) Okay well then, all right, well just have a seat there. Umm, so what’s—what is—what’s your name?",
        "Uh-huh, go on.",
        "That’s your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well let’s-let’s just have a look-see here. (Looking at his resume)",
        "Oh come on, what are you talking about? You’ve got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday’s, come on!",
        "Okay, hold on just a second. (She grabs a camera out of the desk and takes his picture.) I’m sorry, it’s for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please?",
        "Chandler, you have an assistant right?",
        "No, I-I just don’t know how you decide who to hire. I mean I’ve got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there’s this guy…",
        "I love him. He’s so pretty I wanna cry! I don’t know what to do. Tell me what to do.",
        "Uh-huh. No, I hear what you’re saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? (Takes out his picture.) Look how pretty!",
        "Okay you’re right. I’ll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!",
        "Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?",
        "Kinda.",
        "Oh-ohh, thank you.",
        "Well…",
        "But I hired you!",
        "Yeah! You-you got the job! You’re my new assistant!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home.",
        "Hi!",
        "Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.",
        "Oh, my-my new assistant was very happy that I hired my new assistant.",
        "I’m sorry Joey.",
        "Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?",
        "Joey, why would you do that?",
        "Tag? (He turns and looks at her.) Hi, who was that?",
        "Really? (Giggles.)",
        "Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a second? (Goes into office.)",
        "(grabbing Phoebe) Okay. We’ll be right back. (They go into her office and she closes the door.)",
        "All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I’m telling you…",
        "Yes, I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably not the smartest thing that I’ve ever done. But I’m telling you, from this moment on I swear this is strictly professional. (There’s a knock on the door.) Yes?",
        "Hi!",
        "Gay? Yeah. (Kathy leaves dejectedly.)",
        "(noticing him) Hi! (Puts the pictures away.)",
        "Well yeah, sure, what’s up?",
        "Oh really?!",
        "Oh, did you not want people to know that?",
        "Why’s that?",
        "Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don’t want you to feel like you can’t tell me things. (Motions for him to sit down.)",
        "‘Kay.",
        "Yeah.",
        "(Pause) Yeah, she’s gay.",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah, what?",
        "Yeah-yeah, did-didn’t you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm…",
        "Yes!",
        "Oh, y’know what you should get ‘em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.",
        "Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.",
        "Y’know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.",
        "Yeah! I’ve been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.",
        "What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.",
        "That is the Coast Guard.",
        "Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We’re not finished with the lesson yet.",
        "Okay, I’m just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?",
        "Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let’s do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, (grabs some of the rigging) what’s this called?",
        "Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?",
        "No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?",
        "Time’s up, now you're dead.",
        "Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?! (She punctuates each word by slapping him on the forehead.)",
        "Don’t just say yes! This isn’t a game, Joey, you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!",
        "(laughing) Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.",
        "I don’t know. Y’know, they didn’t get us anything.",
        "Well hello! So, when are we gettin’ back out on the water matey?",
        "Why not?",
        "What? I was just trying to teach you.",
        "Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn’t move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.",
        "Look Joey, I’m sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.",
        "Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?",
        "Yeah, I didn’t want you to get hit by the boom!",
        "All right, y’know what? I-I’m sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.",
        "I won’t boss you around.",
        "And, I’ll be nice.",
        "And—Joey!",
        "Okay Joey honey, you’re doing really good! All right, now I’m just gonna need you to step to the port side. (Joey pauses as he tries to remember which side is the port side.) Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?",
        "Right?",
        "It’s left sweetie, but that’s okay sweetie, that’s a tough one.",
        "Okay, go to the left. (Joey goes starboard or sits on the right side of the boat.) The left!",
        "(yelling) Just sit over there!! (Points to the port side.)",
        "No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.",
        "Okay Joey, we’re luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham? (The mainsail has started to flap in the wind and has stopped working efficiently; she wants him to tighten it so that it starts working again.)",
        "Joey, come on! We just went over this! (She does it instead.)",
        "(angrily) No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!",
        "What do you mean you quit?! You can’t quit!",
        "Because you’re not finished yet and I won’t have it! Greens do not quit!",
        "Oh my God, wait did I—I just said Greens don’t quit didn’t I? (Pause) (Angrily) Did I just say Greens don’t quit?!",
        "No! No! No! I’m not yelling at you, I’m just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, oh I’m my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I’ve been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin’. Oh, Joey, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.",
        "Really?",
        "Awww…",
        "Left.",
        "Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.",
        "Oh we’re not sailing.",
        "All right. (She does so and it brings the cooler closer together.) Hey-hey-hey!! (Sees what’s in the cooler.) Sandwiches!",
        "(hands him one) Here you go.",
        "Oh wow! (She takes a bite, but holds the sandwich vertically so that the stuff falls out.)",
        "Oh, sorry.",
        "Oh whoops.",
        "Hey look-look, Phoebe’s talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy.",
        "Hey, I thought that guy was married.",
        "Phoebe, if this guy’s going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him?",
        "Oh, I gotta get back to work.",
        "Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.",
        "Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife.",
        "I am not gonna get fired, because I’m not gonna act on it.",
        "Why? Is he? He is! Isn’t he? He’s dating that slut in marketing!",
        "Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?",
        "Oh, well drop and give me ten more!",
        "Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?",
        "Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?",
        "(startled) Ahh, hi! Hi! Melissa, what’s up? I’m just uh, about to umm, go out to the store to get some stuff to put in my backpack. Y’know, like dried fruit and granola and stuff. What’s up? (She has put on the backpack.)",
        "No. Why?",
        "Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?",
        "Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain’t a locker room, okay? But, y’know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight.",
        "Oh yeah. All right, back to work.",
        "Yeah Melissa, I don’t want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but I will call your supervisor.",
        "Hi Joey! What are you doing here?",
        "Yeah, sure. Umm…here. (Hands him one.)",
        "Yeah, I don’t think so Joe.",
        "Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?",
        "How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I’ll pay.",
        "I’m not asking you to go on a date with him!",
        "Joey, just-just he-he’s new in town and I know he doesn’t have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I’ll really appreciate it.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Yeah!",
        "Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?",
        "Ohh that’s nice.",
        "Wo-women? You mean like old women?",
        "(Pause) Oh.",
        "That’s great! Wow man, so Joey must’ve really taught you some stuff huh?",
        "Yeah?",
        "(entering) Hi!",
        "So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night.",
        "Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.",
        "Y’know, all the women.",
        "All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it’s just—And I know he’s my assistant and I can’t date him—but it just bothers me, all right?!",
        "All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this dating tons of women thing is!",
        "I just don’t want him to meet anybody until I am over my crush—And I will get over it. It’s-it’s not like I love him, it’s just physical! But—I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya!",
        "Yeah. Sure. (Joey nods his head questioningly and Rachel nods no.)",
        "(To Joey) So, will you talk to him?",
        "Oh, come on! I’ll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.",
        "Hi! (He hands her her mail) Thanks, hey so uh what’d you do last night?",
        "Oh yeah? Another night of bird-dogging the chickas?",
        "Wow! I did not see that coming.",
        "Oh no, yes I do! I do! I mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying I am happier when uh, y’know?",
        "Really?",
        "Sp-spoil?",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Well, I-I’m startin’ too.",
        "Yes! Hell yes!",
        "Okay.",
        "I’d love to!",
        "(panics, turns around, picks up the phone, and pretend to talk on it) Hello?! (Listens) Oh, yeah! (To Tag) This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. (Tag leaves and she closes the door behind him, disgustedly.) Yeah!",
        "Oh my God! This is it! (She and Phoebe hold hands.) (To Phoebe) I really hope it’s you!",
        "Me too!",
        "Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!",
        "Hypothetically!",
        "Uh-hmm.",
        "Yeah that’s actually a pretty good idea.",
        "Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing (A woman at the table behind them overhears Chandler’s name and starts listening closer), my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that…",
        "Fine!",
        "Yeah?",
        "Really?!",
        "Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I’m just—Wait a minute. If I’m your maid of honor that means you are Monica’s.",
        "Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica’s!",
        "Why does it matter so much to you?!",
        "What-what if I marry Ross—Or Joey?",
        "Yeah but Phoebe…",
        "Okay. Okay. It’s—since you’ve never done it before you can be Monica’s maid of honor.",
        "I’m gonna marry someone good y’know.",
        "Better than Chandler. (Phoebe exhales as if to say, \"Like what isn’t?\")",
        "Phoebe is gonna be Monica’s maid of honor!",
        "(shocked) You have been maid of honor before?!!",
        "All right that’s it! I am maid of honor!",
        "How come you are?!",
        "Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can’t we just flip a coin?!",
        "Okay. Okay fine, y’know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. (Ross enters.) (In a sexy voice.) Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.",
        "Okay, uh…",
        "…it’s gonna be okay!",
        "Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y’know, it’s-it’s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don’t get to keep the gifts.",
        "Thanks!",
        "Thank you judges.",
        "Oh!",
        "Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!",
        "Ohh, wait a minute, we haven’t pre…",
        "Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster’s Dictionary defines marriage as… (Ross and Joey start writing.) Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh… I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six-year-olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six-year-old.",
        "Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I’ve known them separately and I’ve known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass (Grabs a glass and holds it up) to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.",
        "Aw, thanks!",
        "What?!",
        "Well then I demand a recount! (Hmm, I wonder where I’ve heard that before.)",
        "No! Y’know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous—We’re gonna flip a coin! (Phoebe gasps.) All right?! (She flips the coin.) Heads! (Looks at the coin and grunts in disgust.)",
        "Well y’know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower! (Runs out.)",
        "Hi Pheebs.",
        "Hi! I just want to apologize. I’m really sorry I was a baby.",
        "Yeah. Yeah, and y’know you-you deserve to win. And-and y’know I was thinking about it, if-if you’re Monica’s maid of honor that means I get to be yours.",
        "Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y’know just in case…",
        "Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. (Shows Phoebe the picture.) And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here’s a little purse that I found. (Hands her the purse) Y’know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.",
        "And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y’know ‘cause, people cry at weddings. (Starting to cry.) I’m just gonna grab a couple of these.",
        "Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica’s something borrowed and it’s blue. (Starts to cry again.) Yeah…",
        "You do? Why?",
        "But Pheebs, y’know you earned it.",
        "No, I was ten. I just developed early.",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she’s gonna be yours. (Phoebe gets suddenly scared.)",
        "(entering, happily) Gooood morning!!",
        "Well, why shouldn’t I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!",
        "Come on, it’s not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.",
        "(pauses as she thinks and exhales loudly) We… We are not… …going to let it… be a problem.",
        "Well y’know, we did other stuff too. (Joey and Chandler start to giggle.)",
        "Oh Monica come on, y’know I don’t sleep with guys on the first date!",
        "Anymore!!",
        "Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?",
        "Okay, thank you. That’ll be all. (The mail guy leaves and Tag starts to follow, but Rachel stops him.) (Excitedly) Wait! Wait! (Rushes over and closes the office-door.) Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us. (They kiss.)",
        "Okay, you hard worker! I’ll remember to put that in your evaluation.",
        "Well, you’ve been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y’know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate. (She turns around and sweeps the stuff off of her desk and hops up onto it.)",
        "No, I’ve just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?",
        "(hugging him) So did you read your evaluation yet?",
        "(worried) Okay please, you’re kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you!",
        "I’m thinkin’ no.",
        "Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny tushie.",
        "Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, \"Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision,\" and under Problems with Performance I wrote, \"Dear God, I hope not,\" and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.",
        "Maybe it’s not as bad as I think. Y’know, maybe they didn’t take it the way I meant it.",
        "Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!",
        "Yeah?",
        "Oh my God! Joey!",
        "Ugh!",
        "Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we’re gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner’s office. Now, he doesn’t get in until 10, so he’s no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.",
        "Yeah, well Betty is kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. (Holding up the box of chocolates.) Now, while I distract her, you get in the office.",
        "Let’s roll!",
        "(worried and shocked) Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything—minute. Okay. Fine. (To Tag) Abort the plan, abort the plan. (She start to usher Tag out.)",
        "Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates? (Holds up the box.)",
        "(laughs) Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, (getting serious) what would happen exactly.",
        "Well…",
        "Oh no-no-no…",
        "You’re lookin’ at it upside down—y’know what? (Grabs the evaluation and throws it out.) It doesn’t matter.",
        "Whoa! I can’t believe you did that. That was really sweet.",
        "No, you could’ve lost your job.",
        "Thank you! You’re great! (They kiss.)",
        "What?",
        "I… It just—it took me so long to get that desk organized.",
        "(looking at his butt) There it is. (They hug.)",
        "Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?",
        "Oh good. (She walks to the closed bathroom door, opens it, and finds a naked woman wrapped in a towel.) Ahhh! My God, sorry! (She closes the door and confronts Joey.)",
        "What-what?! You’re gonna leave this person with me?!",
        "Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!",
        "Y’know what? That’s a lot to remember, can’t I just tell her you’re a pig?",
        "Well forget it, I’m not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.",
        "Hi.",
        "Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.",
        "Hi.",
        "(pause) Would you like some pancakes?",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!",
        "I know!",
        "Oh and I’ll call ya too!",
        "Bye!",
        "Oh Joey, I’m sorry I just couldn’t tell her all those things you wanted me to tell her. And y’know we got to talking and I…",
        "Cupid.",
        "Look Joey, come on, she’s so perfect for you! I mean, she’s sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.",
        "Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.",
        "Fine. (They start to walk away.)",
        "Phoebe!",
        "I’m sorry?",
        "Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?",
        "Yeah, there was. It was—there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read—Yes, there was.",
        "Well now what’s the rush?",
        "Well look who’s here!",
        "Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!",
        "Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.",
        "A birthday party.",
        "Alison’s birthday party.",
        "32. (Joey’s not buying it.)",
        "(does a retching sound) Wait a minute! Why don’t you guys do something?!",
        "How did it go with Erin?",
        "(gasps) Oh my God! Listen to you talkin’ about having kids. Oh my Joey. (She goes over and hugs him.) Oh, please don’t get married before I do.",
        "So how’s it goin’ with Joey?",
        "Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.",
        "But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!",
        "Ugh, tramp!",
        "Yeah, see ya.",
        "Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh no, yeah.",
        "Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she’s not lookin’ for a serious relationship.",
        "Well, she told me. She said she’s kind of a loner.",
        "Joey…",
        "Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell ‘em you’re not looking for a relationship.",
        "Well that too. (Joey goes into his room.) Joey?",
        "Do you want some pancakes?",
        "(freaking out) Oh my god!!",
        "You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.",
        "(to Monica) Did you know he was in there?",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Drums?",
        "(stopping at Phoebe’s entrance) Ha!",
        "Joey, y’know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.",
        "What are you talking about? I love them! (Looks into the cage) Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?",
        "Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.",
        "What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?",
        "And that makes you angry because…",
        "Where did you get that?",
        "Phoebe?",
        "Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!",
        "It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.",
        "Oh, it's so much more fun with you.",
        "We did!",
        "Oh, I would love to!",
        "Good, good, good, good, good. (She runs to the drums and gets the sticks)",
        "(with the sticks in her hands) Um... (She goes to the tarantula-cage and puts the sticks into it) Done!",
        "Oh wow! Look at this place!",
        "(yelling from another room) Oh my God!",
        "(returning) Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?",
        "And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?",
        "Do you really not know where I’m going with this? (Phoebe nods, \"No.\") It left! It’s one huge room!",
        "See?",
        "You can’t, because of the new skylight!",
        "So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?",
        "Oh yeah? Startin’ to feel her again there are we?",
        "Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?",
        "Phoebe, it’s okay. I like living with Joey.",
        "Oh please, I hate packing, it’s closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I’m really gonna miss living with you.",
        "I know. (They hug.) Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I’m gettin’ something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?",
        "(entering with Phoebe) Hey!",
        "(seeing the collection of characters.) Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny’s funeral in here.",
        "Oh.",
        "I got it!",
        "Its back in cage!",
        "Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!",
        "All right, I got 48.",
        "(counting the place settings) How come we have one extra place setting?",
        "Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.",
        "Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... your food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.",
        "Seriously, it's moving!",
        "(gets up and opens the door) Hi Tag! What are you doing here?",
        "Well, sure! Come in! (He enters) Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?",
        "Oh, I'm sorry.",
        "Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?",
        "Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?",
        "When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?",
        "Interesting.",
        "Huh. A moo-point?",
        "(to Monica and Phoebe) Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?",
        "You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.",
        "Hey!",
        "How are you holding up?",
        "Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.",
        "So were you guys together a long time?",
        "Now that she broke up with you?",
        "Yeah. Hmmmm.",
        "No…Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it…it has to work out.",
        "Because, uh—it has to.",
        "Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.",
        "Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out! (They hug)",
        "Uh, yeah, well, see, he… Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and…you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!",
        "No? (He shakes his head) All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.",
        "Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.",
        "What?",
        "Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?",
        "(she hurries after him) Wait, we still have time to talk and they’re-they're not even in the car yet! (She takes a quick look down the street.) Oh look, there they go, okay. (She hurries in too)",
        "Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? (In a girlish voice) I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. (Back to normal again) Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out",
        "(gasps) Hi!",
        "(uncovers the dog) Hi!",
        "Oh, hi! How are you doing?",
        "Oh.",
        "Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.",
        "Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It—y’know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?",
        "Oh, god, I knew it, that I freaked you out.",
        "Really?",
        "Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.",
        "No. No, you can’t.",
        "Oh I don’t-I don’t know.",
        "Yeah actually, I think we’re gonna take off too. We rented a movie.",
        "Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone.",
        "Oh. (They leave, leaving just Joey and Ross.)",
        "You wanna go in the bedroom? It’s a little more comfortable.",
        "Okay. (They start to head for the bedroom) Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?",
        "No seriously, y’know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?",
        "Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don’t get.",
        "Y’know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? (He starts laughing.) Tag! I’m serious! This isn’t funny! Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!",
        "Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, \"Must go out today,\" and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn’t want to seem too bossy.",
        "Y’know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.",
        "Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!",
        "No! Come on its late, we’re not gonna go down to the office.",
        "Okay get your coat! (They get their coats and start to leave. Rachel suddenly stops and sticks her hand up the back of her shirt.) Oh! When did you unhook this? (Her bra.) Nice work!",
        "Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean, this is what I’m talking about! You have to be organized! You’ve got newspapers! You’ve got magazines! You got—Ohh! (Finds a picture.) And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag, but whatever.",
        "Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y’know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk. (She goes into her office.)",
        "In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it (Looks down onto her desk and finds the folder with the Post-It on it that contains the contracts she imagined she gave Tag) that said, \"Must go out today.\" So you just keep looking in there! All right?",
        "Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don’t you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?",
        "I don’t know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It’s not a perfect world! Just go please.",
        "Thank you. (He leaves and she proceeds to plant the folder in his bottom drawer. She then picks up the phone and holds it to her breasts.) Hello? (Hangs up the phone.) I still don’t get it.",
        "Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh… (She looks for a place to set it on his messy desk and he clears a spot for her to set it down.) …fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me?",
        "Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!",
        "Well yeah, I wish that you would. (He opens the top drawer.) Well, no it’s not in there! (Closes it.) How about that drawer? (She points to the bottom one and he opens it. She doesn’t see the folder she planted and bends over to check.)",
        "(thinks) Y’know, I don’t-I don’t know. Let me, let me check. (As she heads for her office, she stops glances over her shoulder at Tag, looks into her office, and finds the folder on her desk.)",
        "Can I see you in my office for a minute?",
        "You put these on my desk!",
        "Oh really? So you’re saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?! (I think Dogbert should have a line here.)",
        "(pause as she realizes her lame attempt to shift the blame has failed) I am so hot for you right now.",
        "(Comes in the front door and walks towards the kitchen.) Hi.",
        "Oh, y’know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I—(Chandler puts a forkful of the cheesecake in her mouth.)—Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this? (She reaches over to look at the label on the box.)",
        "Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. (Gasping) Thief.",
        "Why, why not?",
        "Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.",
        "(taking a bite) Oh, I’m sorry, what?",
        "Umm, I think he’s still out. What’s wrong?",
        "(reading the note) \"Pheebs, can’t make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy.\" (Laughs) Big Daddy?",
        "Hi!",
        "So just bring it back downstairs, what’s the problem?",
        "Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?",
        "It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling… (Pause) Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!",
        "Yeah and we’ll drop it off downstairs so that we’re not tempted.",
        "Momma’s Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois. (They exit with the cheesecake.)",
        "What? Wait a minute, I didn’t pay, I thought you paid!",
        "(gasps) Its still there! (The cheesecake they returned to Mrs. Braverman is still lying in front of her door.)",
        "She could be out of town. Maybe she’ll be gone for months.",
        "No that could kill her.",
        "No, so we’re protecting her.",
        "But we should move quick.",
        "Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.",
        "(taking a bite) Oh my God! That is so good!",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh it’s umm, it’s tofu cake. Do you want some? (He makes a disgusted noise and heads for his room, Chandler follows him in.)",
        "(with a mouthful) Mm-mmm. (Nods no.)",
        "Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are dessert stealers! We are living outside the law!",
        "What?! What?!",
        "Wait a minute!",
        "Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don’t!",
        "You think I trust you with it?! No! We’re gonna split it! You take half and I take half!",
        "What? Oh, well then y’know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.",
        "Okay! (Grabs a knife and cuts it in half.) All right, pick a half.",
        "Oh for God sake just pick a piece!",
        "That’s also the smaller piece. (Puts the piece onto a plate.) Okay, there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and don’t come crying to me if you eat your piece too fast. (As she’s saying that she is backing out the door, when she finishes she turns around to return to her place, stumbles and drops the cheesecake on the floor.) Oh!!!!",
        "Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.",
        "Oh! Yay! Look! There’s a piece that doesn’t have floor on it!",
        "Hey, come on now!",
        "Hey.",
        "Well, y’know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.",
        "So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.",
        "And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.",
        "No?",
        "I’m sorry, Rosita? As in…",
        "Joey, it’s just a chair! What’s the big deal?",
        "Stevie the TV?",
        "No! (Joey sets his beer and bag of chips down and heads into his room.) Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! (She tries pulling on the back of the chair, until the hinge breaks and the back falls off.) You bitch!",
        "Joey, Joey I am so sorry.",
        "Okay, come on—Joey, I’ll buy you a new one! All right? We’ll go down to the store right now and we’ll-we’ll get you a new chair.",
        "But don’t you think Rosita would’ve wanted you to move on? I mean y’know, she did always put…your comfort first.",
        "(grabbing her coat) Okay? You ready?",
        "You will like it!",
        "You don’t even know!",
        "Well look, if you don’t like this…(The audience’s laughter at Chandler’s progress cuts out the rest of Rachel’s line.)",
        "Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y’know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.",
        "Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y’know, start the heeling process?",
        "That’s weird.",
        "It’s not a miracle Joey! I’m sure there’s some explanation.",
        "Joey, I really don’t…",
        "Well no.",
        "No, y’know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!",
        "That’s right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair. (She sits down in the chair.)",
        "(grabbing a beer out of the chair’s fridge) I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!",
        "Hey, how’s…how’s the uh, miracle chair?",
        "Yeah? Wow! Y’know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!",
        "Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!",
        "Hey Chandler!",
        "How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?",
        "Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?",
        "I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000. (Which is an actual product by the way, I’m not sure about the 3000 part.)",
        "Well, it’s a long story, but umm I broke Joey’s chair…",
        "Yeah.",
        "Ohhhhh. That’s how it got fixed!",
        "Noo! (Laughs) Angels.",
        "What? Wh-hey!",
        "Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!",
        "No Joe, no miracle.",
        "Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don’t get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! (Joey starts to get up.) No I take that back!",
        "No-no-no! This chair’s not going anywhere.",
        "The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!",
        "We’re the Cobras!",
        "Ahhhh….",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.",
        "Good ones?",
        "Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?",
        "Y’know, I’m still 29 in Guam.",
        "Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?",
        "Look, y’know I know my life’s going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who’ve accomplished so many other goals by the time they’re thirty.",
        "There you go!",
        "Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!",
        "Nothing. I don’t want to do anything.",
        "Really! God Ross, what were you thinking? (To Phoebe, quietly) I know it’s really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.",
        "Y’know what? I am going to do something today. I’m not just gonna sit around like some old lady. I’m gonna get something pierced. Like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something.",
        "So what?! Y’know what? The way I see it—(Phoebe pulls out a hair from the back of her head)—Ow! Son of a bitch!!",
        "(glares at him) Get out, get out of my apartment.",
        "(entering) Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She’s coming!",
        "What’s-what’s going on? Phil’s really pissed!",
        "Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.",
        "Ahh!",
        "(opening it) A scooter! (She’s not happy.)",
        "No! No-no, I love it. Thank you. (Kisses him.)",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay. (Opens the card and reads it.) Happy birthday Grandma! It’s better to be over the hill (starting to cry) then buried under it. (Breaks down as everyone glares at them.) All our love Monica and Chandler. (Crying) That’s funny, yeah!",
        "(crying) No, I know! I get it! It’s funny!",
        "No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don’t have any of those things. That’s why it’s so funny. (Runs into her room crying.)",
        "Well, I feel fine, but I think you’re bumming out the rest of the kids.",
        "Okay! Y’know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids…",
        "As I was saying… I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I’m 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!",
        "So, if I wanna have my kid when I’m 35, I don’t have to get pregnant until I’m 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant…",
        "No, so I don’t have to get married until I’m 33! That’s three years, that’s three whole years—Oh, wait a minute though. I’ll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I’d like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged… Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I’m thirty.",
        "No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!",
        "(To Chandler) I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.",
        "Hey. (After she leaves.) Oh, poor Pheebs.",
        "Ross, I really don’t think…",
        "Hey Joey, can I…",
        "Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag.",
        "Whatever! Okay, I’m not your mother.",
        "Not in the street!!",
        "(to Tag) Hi.",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah, I’m doing okay. I’m um…let’s talk.",
        "Umm…",
        "Ohh Tag, umm…you’re such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I don’t-I don’t…",
        "Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but I just think I’m past the point where I think I can y’know, just have fun.",
        "Yeah, it is! But you’re just a kid! I mean you’re 25!",
        "Oh God! Y’know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually, if I’m wishin’ for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.",
        "Yeah, I’m sorry. (They hug.)",
        "Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?",
        "(starting to cry) Ohh…",
        "Yeah, it’s just y’know…",
        "Oh! I would love to read a poem.",
        "(crying) It’ll be a short one.",
        "Ohhh…",
        "Wait, what do you mean you’re getting a new brain?",
        "She is so good at throwing drinks in people’s faces, I mean I don’t think I’ve ever seen her finish a beverage.",
        "Oh!",
        "Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.",
        "(They both look behind them.) Well, I'd have to say gay.",
        "Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.",
        "Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.",
        "All right, straight, and not subtle. (The man gets up and leaves.)",
        "Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.",
        "What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fall in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.",
        "What? Wait! Why…why do you get the story?",
        "Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.",
        "Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.",
        "Yeah! (Breaking up) And until now, I didn’t think I’d love again.",
        "Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?",
        "Well umm, maybe we could uhh… (Grabs the phone) Ah-ha! Too slow!!",
        "No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that’s not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don’t we, why don’t we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.",
        "I don’t think so.",
        "(checking the speed dial) All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.",
        "Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.",
        "Yes okay. (Checking the speed dial again.) Well now see this isn’t telling us anything. (Reading the speed dial) Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat’s a steak house!",
        "(looking at the speed dial) Oh, I win! He’s got Barney’s on his speed dial.",
        "(showing Phoebe her phone) His new girlfriend!",
        "Hi Pheebs!",
        "How are ya?",
        "Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy’s cell phone?",
        "And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?",
        "And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!",
        "You stole the phone!",
        "No? So you’re saying that if I called it, it wouldn’t ring?",
        "Phoebe!",
        "Oh is it?! (She answers the cute guy’s phone.) Uhh, hello? (On her phone) Yes hi, is Rachel there? (On the other phone) Yes she is, just one moment please. (To Phoebe, holding out both phones.) It’s for me!",
        "Oh my God! I bet that’s him. My digital fairy tale is about to begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh (In a sexy voice) Hello? Or should I be (Happily) Hi! It’s Rach… (Phoebe knocks the phone out of Rachel’s hand, catches it, and answers it.) Would you stop doing that?!",
        "Phoebe! You can’t do th…",
        "You do know that I will be here when he comes over.",
        "You just said it!",
        "Oh Phoebe!",
        "Ohh! (Exits.)",
        "Hey! Hey!",
        "(simultaneously) Who is it?",
        "Well why shouldn’t I?!",
        "Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.",
        "(laughs) You’re not the man who left the cell phone.",
        "Is-is he coming? (Looks hopefully out the door.)",
        "We’ll be right back sir.",
        "I don’t know!",
        "I know! (Realizes what Phoebe said.) What?!",
        "(turning and looking at Tom again) No-no they do but, you just have to wait.",
        "(fake disappointment) All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have him, but you owe me; you owe me big!",
        "Ohh…",
        "Hi.",
        "Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!",
        "(screaming) MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!! (Runs to Monica’s.)",
        "God. You seem really, really nice.",
        "I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.",
        "Okay.",
        "You are so beautiful.",
        "(giggles) (To Ross) I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.",
        "No!",
        "Hi! Hi Ben!",
        "Oh, yeah go ahead.",
        "No. No.",
        "Ben, it's Rachel! (He closes the door.) But whatever.",
        "Awww, just like his daddy.",
        "What-what about Monica?",
        "(nervous) So it would just be me alone?",
        "Huh umm…",
        "Well that—y’know it’s just uh, I’ve never done that before. Me and him alone.",
        "Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?",
        "Okay.",
        "Yeah I think so.",
        "Bye. (Ross exits.) Ahhh… (Silence) So this is fun, huh?",
        "Okay. Uh, want something-want something to drink?",
        "Uh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke?",
        "Okay. Well that’s pretty much all that we have—Oh! Oh! Have you ever had a virgin margarita? (Holds up a bottle of margarita mix.)",
        "Water it is.",
        "Ben y’know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang out all the time. ‘Cause I was, I was your daddy’s girlfriend.",
        "No, I’m not.",
        "Hey! We were not on a—Okay. That’s fine! Fine. Y’know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?",
        "(checks her watch) Fifty-two minutes. (Pause) So no-no brothers and sisters, huh? That must be nice. You don’t have to share stuff.",
        "Oh, you’re one of those. But y’know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.",
        "Well y’know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we’d jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they’d put salt on their cereal.",
        "Yeah? You like that one?",
        "I’m funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I’ve got a ton of these! Umm, oh here—Do you want a good one? Here’s a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? (Does so.) And then you say to person, I bet you can’t roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they’re left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.",
        "Yeah, I-I-I-I’m funny Ben, but I’m not stupid. Okay?",
        "Coming.",
        "Uh-oh.",
        "Oh yeah? Did he pull the old… (She is waving her hand up and down her face. She’s thinking about the pencil mark.)",
        "Oh that.",
        "Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don’t think that’s just a little funny?!",
        "(looking at his mark) Yes.",
        "Hi!",
        "Well y’know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself, \"What’s up with Carol and sweet, little Ben?\"",
        "Okay.",
        "I’d love that. I would loooove… (Carol goes to make the coffee and she sits down.) So uh, so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little...",
        "I found him! (To Ben) Very funny, come here! (She sits down on the coffee table and Ben walks up.) That is exactly why I’ve come here to talk to you okay?",
        "Yes oh—(To Ben)—Do I want sugar in my coffee? (Ben nods no.) No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. (To Ben) Okay, do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?",
        "Don’t do that.",
        "Seriously, your dad doesn’t like pranks.",
        "Oh damnit!",
        "No! Don’t say that! Don’t say that!",
        "No don’t! Go back to repeating!",
        "Oh crap!",
        "So now what have we agreed?",
        "And-and what else?",
        "Very good.",
        "I’m just visiting my good friend Carol.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Carol…Lesbian?",
        "What line?",
        "All right, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you but you were so mad already!",
        "Okay, maybe they are not funny to you…",
        "Or Carol! But they’re funny to kids and who is it hurting?!",
        "That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, \"I will be revenged?!\"",
        "Fine. Fine, but I’ll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I’ll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that’s what you want!",
        "Look he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters, somebody’s gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven’t taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn’t know anyway!",
        "I gotta go! (Runs out.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don’t we Ben? (He nods yes.)",
        "Ohh, okay. (Ross has a sign on his back that reads ‘Poop.’) Wh—Ah-ha! (Ross stops and turns.) Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can’t do it.",
        "I can’t let him go out that way, he’s got a meeting. (To Ross) You’ve got something here on your back.",
        "Oh I…",
        "No! Wait! Come on!",
        "No you guys… (She walks out into the hallway.)",
        "EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!! (She runs over to him and finds that it was a dummy and that she had been had.)",
        "Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?",
        "(to the gang) Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don’t think I have the energy for this.",
        "(screaming) Melissa!",
        "Wh—(Turns and looks at the gang who’s staring)—Why don’t I tell you over here? (She walks Melissa away from the gang.)",
        "Oh no-no, no! It’s good! It’s all good! I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren!",
        "I will not! I’m the divisional head of men’s sportswear!",
        "Oh please…",
        "No.",
        "Oh tomorrow, oh I don’t know. Um…",
        "Shut up.",
        "Oh, wow thanks! (Reading the card) Oh you’re in real estate!",
        "Wow! What do you do now?",
        "Okay! (Joins the rest of the gang.)",
        "Shut up, that was my friend Melissa from college.",
        "She’s actually very sweet and we used to be very close.",
        "(To Monica) Yes.",
        "It’s not a big deal!",
        "No we weren’t! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y’know, ended up…kissing for a bit.",
        "Oh wow. Why don’t we just take me (Grabs her pin) and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. (Puts her pin at the bar and laughs. Monica just glares at her.) These pins aren’t for playing are they?",
        "Hey!",
        "Stop picturing it!!",
        "That is not a problem.",
        "Oh, get out of here! (Jumps back and walks away.)",
        "(motioning to a rack) So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there’s anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. (Grabs a few) But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.",
        "I’m Monica’s maid of honor. Okay? Don’t try to blue pin me!",
        "Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they’re done with them they just send ‘em back.",
        "Some of them.",
        "Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?",
        "Umm, well let’s see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.",
        "(reading a tag) This one is uh Paul O’Neil.",
        "He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. (Chandler nods and Rachel grabs another tux) Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It’s a pretty cool tux.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "So Joey, I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding: do you need one?",
        "Well, what are you going to wear?",
        "Huh. Does Monica know about this?",
        "Can I please be there when you tell her? (Joey nods yes.)",
        "Oh, y’know what? I can’t. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.",
        "Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey’s lewd version?",
        "Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time…she and I y’know…kissed a little bit.",
        "It-it did!",
        "Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes!",
        "Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!",
        "I’m not saying that I’m a lesbian! I’m just saying that this happened!",
        "(shocked) Vanilla?!",
        "I’m not vanilla! I’ve done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!",
        "All right, y’know what? If you don’t want to believe me about this, why don’t you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.",
        "Oh. Oh, that’s great!",
        "(changing the subject) Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh, tellin’ Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out.",
        "Remember?! We—come on, we both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops…",
        "…we went back to the house and we got really silly and we…we made out.",
        "How can you not remember us kissing?!",
        "Wh… Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn’t stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin’ together?",
        "Yeah—but come on—Listen, I’m sorry I don’t want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn’t believe me.",
        "No!!",
        "Thank you Phoebe.",
        "It happened! I am telling you it happened!",
        "What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! (She does so.) Okay? Look, that night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I’m not gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you don’t remember that, maybe you will remember this! (She grabs Melissa and kisses her on the lips.)",
        "(shocked) What?",
        "(moving away) Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!",
        "(moves away again) I-I-I-I’m just…I’m just a good kisser!",
        "I’m sorry!",
        "Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna…",
        "What the hell was that?!",
        "And?",
        "Well y’know what they say, the 23rd time’s the charm. (Chandler enters.) Aww, look at you all handsome!",
        "Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.",
        "I don’t want to say.",
        "Diane Keaton.",
        "Oh my God! You look so beautiful!",
        "I do the same thing.",
        "I’m just kidding too. (Laughs) I’m getting married in December. (Turns away not happy with herself.)",
        "Oh y’know what? Y’know what? Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman’s and get it half off. This place is so overpriced.",
        "So, does this (the dress) come in another color or… (The store owner walks away.)",
        "(To Phoebe) So this is Brooklyn.",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh they’re pushing! They’re pushing!!",
        "Well I…",
        "No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are crazy!",
        "No! You gotta hold my hand!!",
        "(seeing who’s trapped) Hey…",
        "You’re out of Diet Coke.",
        "You’re out of toilet paper!",
        "Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I’m not saying that there’s any connection here y’know, but they did tell me that’s why they got divorced.",
        "Well, what is the other reason?",
        "Well you have to because maybe it’s stupid.",
        "(gasps) Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!",
        "Oh, stop that! Don’t kid about that! (Gasps) Will all the stars be there?",
        "Oh my God! Oh my God! I can’t go! I’m gonna be too nervous!",
        "No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.",
        "I’m fourth! (Joey is startled.) Look at you with your little maple syrup award!",
        "What? No! It’s not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Grammy, Best New Artist.",
        "Ohh that’s great!",
        "So you’ll definitely get onstage, even if you don’t win.",
        "Well of course I do! But y’know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you’re up against the guy who survived his own cremation.",
        "Well Joey, you’ll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. Y’know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y’know? So it’s sorta like… (Does it, you’ll have to see it.)",
        "Y’know?",
        "Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.",
        "(entering from her room) Whoa what?",
        "Really?",
        "Not right now.",
        "Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y’know you—I couldn’t concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what’s it’s like to be 19 and in love.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I didn’t. I got under him.",
        "I know! My God! Do you have your speech?",
        "Do you got your gracious loser face?",
        "Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!",
        "On TV?! Yeah!",
        "Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!",
        "Oh my God you stole her award!",
        "Joey I don’t think you know what behalf means.",
        "Joey, you have got to take this back!",
        "(looking at the award) No! Joey!",
        "Do you really want an award you didn’t win?",
        "Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!",
        "Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don’t want to win an award this way. You’re very talented. And someday you’re gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.",
        "All right? (He sets the award down.) Thank you.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I cannot believe I’m gonna meet Jessica Ashley!",
        "Okay, I’m totally cool! (She coolly knocks on the door)",
        "(coolly) Hey Jess.",
        "‘Sup? (Joey glares at her.)",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I’ll be out in a second.",
        "(entering from her room) Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.",
        "Okay honey, you can finish this later we’re gonna be late. We gotta go.",
        "(entering) Hi!",
        "Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?",
        "(laughs) Well okay—Well don’t ruin it! Just play along at least!",
        "(To Phoebe) Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!",
        "She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday…",
        "Yesterday!",
        "Oh my God, Phoebe, this is impossible! We can’t do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There’s just too much to do! It’s impossible! We can’t do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!",
        "(calmly) Okay. I’m sorry. You’re right, you’re right.",
        "Phoebe, I already, I already did.",
        "Okay. Okay. (They sit down.) I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?",
        "4 o’clock. Food?",
        "Ooh great! Very Monica.",
        "Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?",
        "We’re paying for this y’know.",
        "Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?",
        "(pause) What?",
        "Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don’t have a guest list.",
        "Hey! What’s up Mon?",
        "Have at it.",
        "Are you makin’ him a sandwich?",
        "Okay.",
        "(To Phoebe, after Monica’s gone) We have to get her a present?!",
        "Oh my God you’re amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Well, I don’t know. I called all the people in Monica’s phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.",
        "(to her) Hi! I’m Rachel. This is Phoebe. I’m the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?",
        "Ohhhh!",
        "That’s great!",
        "(to each other) I don’t know.",
        "(to the woman) Excuse us for a minute. (They go into the kitchen.) You didn’t tell her to come?!",
        "No I wasn’t! You were supposed to tell her to come, and I was supposed to bring the cake!",
        "Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!",
        "Oh Monica, we are so sorry.",
        "Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.",
        "Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don’t have either.",
        "Ugh…",
        "What do you, what do you mean?",
        "Surprise…",
        "…Monica.",
        "Monica what?",
        "What is the emergency?!",
        "Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.",
        "Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, \"Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more.\"",
        "Well, y’know, sometimes that helps. (She realises what that could’ve meant.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey, what have you guys been up to?",
        "I can’t believe they’ve been together for three years.",
        "I don’t know why they didn’t just tell us.",
        "Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around wondering what to do.)",
        "What?!",
        "Oh my God!",
        "OH MY GOD!!!",
        "Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!",
        "I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!",
        "Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know, so you have to stop screaming!!",
        "Ohhh!!!",
        "(trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down) HI!! Hi!",
        "Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!",
        "All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.",
        "Are you kidding?!",
        "I can not believe he would do that to Mon—Whoa! (She stops suddenly and slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey, do they know that we know?",
        "Joey!",
        "Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!",
        "Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.",
        "Okay!",
        "You really think it would be that different?",
        "Well, things change.",
        "Hey, who's this little naked guy?",
        "Aww, look at the little thing.",
        "Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?",
        "Well, we were just talkin’ about you guys gettin’ married and how great it is.",
        "Oh, can we read them?",
        "Okay.",
        "(To Monica) Monica, will-will you marry me?",
        "Wait a minute! (To Monica) You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say you’re the only one who’s allowed to drive it.",
        "(shocked) You let Joey drive it?!",
        "Wow! I can’t believe you lied to me.",
        "Take the top down did ya?",
        "Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she’s talking about! I am an excellent driver!",
        "Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.",
        "I think she’s checking out your beehive Ross.",
        "Gimme the keys!",
        "Well no brush!",
        "(to the woman) Alimony. (Runs outside.)",
        "Ahhh! (Gets in.) Ooh, nice!",
        "My God!",
        "Just washing the windshield. (She turns on the wipers forcing Ross off of the hood.)",
        "Oh.",
        "Look Ross, if you’re so freaked out, just get in the car!",
        "All right. (She starts off.)",
        "What are you doing?! Get in the front!",
        "Oh my…",
        "God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.",
        "Oh Ross you’re so tense! You just gotta relax, okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax… (She takes her hands off of the wheel.)",
        "I am not horsing around, okay? I am Porsching around.",
        "Uh-oh. (She starts to pull over.)",
        "Really? You think so?",
        "Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I’ll go under, you go over!",
        "Oh come on Ross!! (She tries to switch places with him and goes under his leg.)",
        "(sexily) Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?",
        "Oh yes, absolutely! Y’know, it’s weird uh, but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh…well I probably shouldn’t tell you the rest.",
        "(handing it to him) Yes. Here you go Officer uh, Handsome.",
        "Oops sorry, my mistake.",
        "Really?! You think so? Y’know, I had just rolled out of bed.",
        "Y’know you’re-you’re probably wondering about the old date on there.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I bet you’re a Gemini.",
        "Taurus?",
        "Virgo?",
        "Sagittarius?",
        "I knew it! I knew it, ahh….",
        "Yeah?",
        "I won’t speed.",
        "I promise.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Oh well…",
        "Remind me to introduce you to someone!",
        "Fourth gear!!",
        "Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o’clock position.",
        "It’s a different guy!",
        "Oh my God!",
        "(pause) You have a son!",
        "(checking her watch) Op! We gotta go! (The girls stand up.)",
        "What‘cha doing Mon?",
        "Hey! Those are all the things I’m responsible for!",
        "The commercial?",
        "Oh that’s great!",
        "Oh, wait Joey! We fought the Nazis in World War II, not World War I.",
        "You’re gonna be late! Go! Go! (He runs out.)",
        "Mexico?",
        "Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful!",
        "Yeah! But I don’t know what he looks like!",
        "Man in the black dress… (Monica walks away and Rachel looks around to find a woman in a black dress.) (To her) Hi! I’m Rachel! I’m a friend of Monica and Chandler’s!",
        "Oh I get it! A…man…duh!",
        "I’ll do it.",
        "I said I’ll do it!",
        "Monica! I’m not gonna screw it up!",
        "Well of course that is what I’m here for!",
        "Ugh! (To Phoebe) What grandmother?",
        "Hi!",
        "She’s steaming her dress, why? What’s up?",
        "What?!",
        "(reading the note) Tell Monica I’m sorry.",
        "Yeah but, maybe it’s not what we think. Maybe it’s tell Monica I’m sorry I…drank the last of the milk.",
        "Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?",
        "Okay.",
        "(closing the door) Ross said there’s still no word from Chandler.",
        "Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.",
        "God! Don’t—We can’t let her start getting ready! This is too awful! Oh God, but wait she’ll be in the gown and then he won’t show up and then she’s gonna have to take off the gown…",
        "I’m sorry. I’m sorry. It’s just…It’s just so sad!",
        "I know. I know. Oh God. (Looking around) There’s no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?",
        "Oh!",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh thank you! (Wiping her nose.) Oh God! (She throws it out.) Can I have another one?",
        "Oh God I just cannot imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn’t show up!",
        "Oh, I mean she’s gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, \"Oh that poor girl.\" Y’know? Then she’ll have to come back here and live all alone.",
        "What?",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Oh my God!",
        "No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night.",
        "Okay Phoebe, we cannot tell anyone about this.",
        "Okay?",
        "No. Why?",
        "Anything?",
        "All right, we’ve got to tell her he’s gone. (Starts to leave.)",
        "Ross, she’s gonna start getting ready soon!",
        "All right, well how much time do you need?",
        "One hour.",
        "Then why do you ask?!",
        "All right, I’ll see you guys later.",
        "I’ll figure something out.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.",
        "Umm… I’m never gonna getting married!",
        "No Monica! I’m serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.",
        "Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.",
        "The nights are the hardest. (Checks her watch.) But then the day comes! And that’s every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again…",
        "I know. At dusk. That’s such a hard time for me.",
        "Okay. But wait!",
        "Let’s go to lunch.",
        "Right.",
        "Oh good God! I’ve fallen down! (She trips and falls.)",
        "Okay. Alright. (Gets up.) Honey listen. When I tell you what I’m about to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you.",
        "We can’t find Chandler…(Phoebe sticks her head and motions that they found Chandler)—‘s vest. We can’t find Chandler’s vest.",
        "Oh!",
        "You look so beautiful.",
        "Hello?",
        "Yeah, we got him back. Everything’s fine.",
        "What? Why? Where are you?",
        "Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!",
        "Oh my God! I’m gonna have to find another minister.",
        "Ugh! Joey, I have to go.",
        "Well Phoebe, we gotta do something! (They turn the corner.) Well, y’know. I mean there’s no way Joey’s gonna make it in time. So I’m gonna go through the hotel and see if there’s any other weddings going on.",
        "Okay.",
        "Anastassakis/Papasifakis wedding, excellent! {It’s a good thing Jennifer Aniston is Greek, because she had to pronounce those names. Luckily for me, they were written on a sign.}(The happy couple emerges.) Congratulations. (To the best man and maid of honor) Mazel Tov! (The rabbi emerges.) Hi! Oh, great hat. (He’s wearing an interesting hat and she takes him over to talk.) Listen umm, I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that?",
        "Yeah! Yeah. They’re…they’re-they’re my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus.",
        "(leaning in) As are you…",
        "Go on! Go on. (She turns back to Chandler.)",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Oh my God, who is it?! (Phoebe rolls her eyes.)",
        "For you. (Chandler leaves.)",
        "Oh, thank you for doing that. I just can’t deal with this just quite yet.",
        "You said that she was, I just didn’t disagree with you.",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "Oh! (They smile and the picture is taken.) Oh by the way?",
        "James Brolin?",
        "Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.",
        "No.",
        "No!",
        "Thank you.",
        "Ugh! Look honey y’know what? I haven’t told him yet, so until I do I don’t think I should tell anybody else.",
        "Phoebe!!",
        "Okay.",
        "Honey, stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him.",
        "Oh y’know what honey? Let’s not talk about that right now?",
        "Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hey! Y’know, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can wear everything they’re supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets through!",
        "I don’t know! Maybe they have tools.",
        "Well, maybe that’s, maybe that’s really brave.",
        "Maybe she hasn’t really thought it through that well.",
        "(starting to cry) I don’t know.",
        "Uh-hmm. I’m just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.",
        "Oh yes! Thank you very much! (She grabs a glass, takes a sip, and realizes what she just did. She then tries to spit the champagne back into the glass without Monica noticing. It doesn’t work.) Oh that’s-that’s actually how the French drink it.",
        "I don’t know. I don’t know how I feel. This is all happening so fast. I have to make all these decisions that I don’t want to make. (Takes another sip of champagne and spits it back out) Somebody just take this away from me!!",
        "What?!",
        "How many ways are there to do that?",
        "All right, I’ll-I’ll take it again when I get home.",
        "Okay. Thank you.",
        "Oh, you guys are so great.",
        "Wh—Hey, I just gave you peeing on a stick.",
        "How much longer?",
        "30 seconds, okay.",
        "Oh I know. I know. (They hug.)",
        "Oh wait! Y’know what? I can’t, I can’t look at it. I can’t. Somebody else tell me, somebody tell me.",
        "Okay.",
        "What?",
        "Oh. Oh. Well there you go. Whew! (Pause) That is—that’s great—that is really great-great news. (Pause) Y’know ‘cause the whole not being ready and kinda the financial aspects, all that. Whew. Wow, this is so just the way it was supposed to be. (Starts to cry.) God.",
        "Thanks. (Crying) God this is so stupid! (Pause) How could I be upset over something I never had? It’s negative?",
        "What?!",
        "Are you sure?",
        "Oh!",
        "Oh-oh, that’s a risky little game!",
        "Yeah. I’m gonna have a baby. I’m gonna have a baby. I’m gonna have a baby! (They all hug.)",
        "Ah, it’s still not the time.",
        "Listen y’know what sir? For the last time, I don’t care what the computer says, we did not take a bag of Mashuga nuts from the mini-bar and we did not watch Dr. Do-Me-A-Little!",
        "Are you joking? Check out is not ‘til noon and he has a good (checks her watch) eleven minutes left.",
        "Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best s*x we ever had. Until y’know, he screamed out Radisson at the end.",
        "(entering) Hi.",
        "Shh-shh-shh! The guys don’t know yet do they?",
        "Don’t worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, ‘cause I’m going to tell the father today.",
        "Ew! No!",
        "Well then you have his baby.",
        "Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.",
        "Well it’s only different if he wants it to be. I mean, I’m not gonna ask him for anything.",
        "Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?",
        "Oh Joey! Joey! No, it’s not you! You didn’t get anybody pregnant!",
        "Not yet.",
        "No! Phoebe, it’s not Gunther.",
        "Phoebe the father is not here okay? I haven’t told him yet and I don’t think I can tell him at all now!",
        "I don’t know, let me think. I was walking down the street thinking, ‘I’m gonna tell the father today’ and then bam!",
        "No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is!",
        "I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I didn’t even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.",
        "What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?",
        "Oh God… Oh, he’s in there right now?",
        "Uh, let’s rip!",
        "Oh Phoebe!",
        "Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But y’know you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?",
        "Oh, it’s just not the right time.",
        "Okay.",
        "Tag…",
        "I’m having a baby.",
        "You can go.",
        "Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?",
        "Oh wow, you didn’t even try to unhook my bra!",
        "No, I will. I’m just not up for it tonight.",
        "I’m not?",
        "What?",
        "No! Joey, oh you’re so sweet. You’re so-so sweet, honey. But I’m not, I’m not looking for a husband.",
        "Now, if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down. (Exits.)",
        "(entering) Oh good you’re still here!",
        "I want to tell you to have a good honeymoon! (Hugs Monica.)",
        "And I also wanted you guys to know that I am telling the father today. (They all look at her expectantly) What? What? What?",
        "How?! How do you know?",
        "Oh, I so wanted Ross to know first, but I’m so relieved you guys know.",
        "I know! (They hug.)",
        "(breaking the hug) You’re all gonna be aunts and uncles.",
        "Okay. Great! So now that you guys all know you can help me. Give me some advice on how I’m gonna tell Ross!",
        "Well I was gonna tell him that I’m-I’m gonna have the baby and he can be as involved as he wants.",
        "Yeah but how do I start? I mean, what’s-what’s the first thing that I say? (They all pause to think.) Okay great! Thanks. (She starts to leave.)",
        "(seeing him) Hi!",
        "Hi. (He helps her up.) Umm, I think there’s something that we really need to talk about.",
        "You do?",
        "(warily) Okay.",
        "(confused) What?",
        "Seriously. What?!",
        "Okay, y’know what? Can I, can I talk now?",
        "(touches his knee) I’m pregnant. (Ross stops.) Ross? (Ross is staring off into space.) Ross? (Ross is still frozen) Okay, whenever you’re ready. (Sits back and opens her magazine.) And you’re the father by the way—but you got that…",
        "(closes her magazine) Can I get you some water?",
        "Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved as you want. (Ross nods.)",
        "I know. I know, but y’know condoms only work like 97% of the time.",
        "They do!",
        "Okay Ross come on let’s just forget about the condoms.",
        "Listen, y’know what? I was really freaked out too when I found out…",
        "Y’know what? Let’s, let’s talk later.",
        "Okay, y’know maybe I should come back… (Starts to leave.)",
        "(stops) Okay.",
        "(sighs) If I said I was, would you judge me?",
        "Okay. (The nurse exits.) Oh man, I swear if they sold these at Pottery Barn…",
        "(shocked) Hi!",
        "Uh-uh-uh, right now? Because I’ve kinda got an el fresco situation going on over here.",
        "Okay Ross that’s fine, but can you please stand near my head?",
        "Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross!",
        "What married?",
        "What, because that’s your answer to everything?",
        "Yeah, maybe if you’re in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are we?",
        "Excuse me?",
        "What?!",
        "I can too eat by myself!",
        "When certain people leave the table and I am not finished!",
        "Oh please, you inhale your food!",
        "Oh no Dr. Long, please come in. This is Ross, he is the father.",
        "I do need you! I need you to stand near my head!",
        "Wow. There it is, I see it.",
        "Okay.",
        "I don’t see it!",
        "I can’t see it!",
        "I know, I lied! I didn’t want her to think I was a terrible mother! I can’t even see my own baby!",
        "Oh. Oh, it’s beautiful. I see it now.",
        "No, I don’t see it!",
        "Yeah.",
        "That’s it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you.",
        "Wow! I can’t believe that’s our baby.",
        "Hi.",
        "Oh, everything went great.",
        "Oh no, I know I couldn’t see it either at first, but it’s right umm… (Starts to cry) Ross, I lost it again.",
        "Well don’t—What happened to Jessica’s body?!",
        "You don’t know do you?",
        "Oh! (Motions to Joey’s co-star.)",
        "Hi.",
        "Well, Joey probably thinks I’ll just embarrass him. Y’know, he thinks I’m some kind of a soap opera nut—Which I’m not! I’m not. Although I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan. (Starts stroking his arm) And uh, and that your-your dog’s name is Wally. Well look at that, I’m just stroking your arm.",
        "Oh, we’re leaving. Bye Kash.",
        "Say hi to Wally.",
        "Hi!",
        "I thought I was a complete idiot.",
        "Oh! Oh, I think I’m gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?",
        "What?!",
        "Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?",
        "Good-good, don’t tell him. Don’t tell him. Just have him call me okay?",
        "Okay, you go do it! I’ll come back to that set! I’ll meet more actors! I’ll meet ‘em all!",
        "Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I’m not drinking on this date tonight. \"Umm, I’m a recovering alcoholic. I’m a Mormon,\" or \"I got so hammered last night I’m still a little drunk?\"",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh no, I can’t. I got a date.",
        "Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?",
        "Yeah—Ooh! Earrings! (Goes into her room.)",
        "(entering from her room) Hey guys do you think this is too slutty—Hi Kash!",
        "Yeah! All right, I’ll see you guys later.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Hi!",
        "Well I’m alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy bars, what do you think?",
        "I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant.",
        "Well better than you, but y’know still not what you want.",
        "He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh, \"Yeah, I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch.\"",
        "Doesn’t he?",
        "Yes.",
        "Okay.",
        "(thinks then gasps) Chandler M. Bing?",
        "Oh my God. (Laughs)",
        "Oh it’s all right. I’m guess I’m just done with the whole dating thing. It’s one more thing in my life that’s suddenly completely different. This is hard.",
        "Thanks sweetie.",
        "Oh no, I think I’m gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.",
        "Oh you did, there are twenty in here.",
        "Good night.",
        "(coming from the bathroom) Hey Pheebs?",
        "I’m having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you wanna come?",
        "Oh no, no, I’ll be there too.",
        "No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I haven’t told him I’m pregnant yet.",
        "‘Cause I know he’s gonna flip out and I hate it when he’s angry.",
        "What Phoebe? Wait! One time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw me doing that again he’d make me eat the entire pack.",
        "Thank you.",
        "(panicking) No you don’t.",
        "Well you could’ve untied it with your hands.",
        "Well actually umm…",
        "(To Phoebe) In case you didn’t notice, that is a scary man.",
        "This was such a huge mistake. I can’t tell him Phoebe. I can’t, I can’t, I can’t, I can’t…",
        "No it’s okay, this is what’s gonna happen. I’m gonna wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him.",
        "Hey, that is the…baby’s problem. (Dr. Green returns.) Oh, everything okay with the waiter?",
        "Well… Umm, I got TiVo.",
        "Phoebe!",
        "Well uh, yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up, yeah.",
        "No, it’s Ross. It’s Ross. You like Ross. (He just shakes his head.) Oh daddy, I hope you’re okay with all of this. I mean think about it, this is a good thing. You’re gonna—This is your first grandchild! You’re gonna be a poppy!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Who?",
        "February 2nd!",
        "I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didn’t want him to start yelling at me like I was some ’74 Latour.",
        "All right here he comes. I’m gonna do this, I’m gonna tell him, I’m gonna be strong.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Really?! The Plaza?!! Oh daddy!! (Hugs him and Phoebe glares at her.) Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you. Please, sit down.",
        "There’s not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.",
        "I’m sorry daddy.",
        "Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.",
        "Yes. Yes, he says I’m damaged goods.",
        "(quietly) Oh no…",
        "Ross I’m so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.",
        "Oh okay, I’ll fix that to. What’s her e-mail address?",
        "All right, I promise. I’ll fix this. I swear. I’ll-I’ll-I’ll-I’ll talk to her.",
        "Okay.",
        "I know Mona, just hear me out. First of all, I’m so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. You’re gonna have to tell me how you did that.",
        "Okay. Um…But—Okay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are definitely not getting back together.",
        "Oh we just—we drove each other crazy!",
        "I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go!",
        "Right! But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is. (Rubbing his shoulder.)",
        "I know, I get it, but Mona, what relationship is not complicated? I mean we all have our baggage! You must too! Why else would you still be single? (Mona looks at her.) I am so gonna leave right now. (Ross opens the door for her and she leaves.)",
        "(entering) Forgot my purse! (Sees them kissing.) Oh, you guys made up. (To Mona) He’s a good kisser isn’t he? (Ross goes to close the door on her.) I’m going! (Quickly leaves and Ross locks the door.)",
        "About an hour ago.",
        "Yes! (She gets up and sets the phone on the counter without hanging it up.) Bye daddy. (Phoebe and her leave.)",
        "Please tell me you’re not gonna dress up like a dinosaur.",
        "Hi!",
        "I am! I am a woman who spent a lot of money on a dress and she wants to wear it, because soon she won’t be able to fit into it.",
        "Ahh!",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh! Oh! Can I give out the candy? I really want to be with the kids right now. Y’know, ever since I got pregnant I-I have the strongest maternal instincts.",
        "(to them) Just a minute!!! (She takes the candy and opens the door to two parents, a witch, a clown, and a cowgirl.) Look at you guys! Wow! You are a very scary witch. (Gives her candy.)",
        "And you are a very funny clown. (Gives him candy.)",
        "(to the cowgirl) And you are so in style right now. Y’know, I work at Ralph Lauren and the whole fall line has got this like equestrian theme going on. I don’t suppose you saw the cover of British Vogue, but…",
        "Yeah. Sure. (Throws some in her bag and she walks away as Phoebe, dressed as Supergirl walks up and eyes Monica who eyes her back.)",
        "(To Monica) Oh, you did this to him?",
        "Oh! (Opens the door to reveal a ballerina) Well you’re just the prettiest ballerina I’ve ever seen.",
        "Oh wow! That deserves another piece of candy.",
        "Well, I have to say that earns tutu pieces of candy.",
        "Ohh… Oh, honey here. Take it all. (Pours the entire large bowl into her bag and closes the door.) Monica! We need more candy?",
        "Yeah I know, but one of them just said that she loved me so I just gave her everything.",
        "Hey.",
        "Hi! Y’know what honey, we’re actually out of candy right now. But someone just went out to get some and I have been giving out money but I’m out of that too. Hey, can I write you a check?",
        "Okay, what’s your name?",
        "Okay, I’m just gonna write this out to cash.",
        "Hey Mona!",
        "Oh Gunther! You brought candy! Thank you so much for picking this up! You are so sweet.",
        "Honey, someday you are gonna make some man the luckiest guy in the world.",
        "Gotta go! (Opens the door to a boy in a cape.) Hi! Wow! There you go! (Hands him some candy.)",
        "Oh yeah, we were but umm, now we’ve got candy.",
        "Well, that-that’s not your choice. Happy Halloween!",
        "Well is it fair that all you did was put on a cape and I gotta give you free stuff?",
        "You shut up!",
        "Uh, I think I just did. And uh-oh, here it comes again. Shut up!",
        "(To Joey) Yeah I know—I’m good—I got it! (Joey slowly backs away.) (To the boy) Now wait a minute, I’ve got one more thing I have to say to you…oh right! Shut up!",
        "No! Wait no! Shut up—I mean don’t cry! Let me get my checkbook! (Grabs her checkbook and runs after him.)",
        "Hey! Well, I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.",
        "No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh, I am just awful with children!",
        "Really? You think that’s all it is?",
        "Wow! What did he do?",
        "I can’t. I’m busy. I’m apartment hunting.",
        "Yeah, I can’t live with Joey once the baby comes. I don’t want my child’s first words to be, (in a baby’s voice) \"How you doin’?\"",
        "Well, I haven’t discussed it with him yet, but I know he’s gonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.",
        "Not so much.",
        "Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?",
        "Yeah that would really be great.",
        "Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldn’t. I mean if she just died this morning out of respect.",
        "Shall we?",
        "And I’m Rachel, an admirer of the building.",
        "Ahh.",
        "So she’s really not dead.",
        "Hmm. Do you think—Could you tell me if she’s hanging in, in a one bedroom or a two?",
        "Hey!",
        "How was the game?",
        "Oh.",
        "Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go.",
        "Oh but Joey, I have to go. There’s no room for a baby here.",
        "Honey, it’s not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there’s a screaming baby around.",
        "Honey, it’s so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can’t do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.",
        "I know.",
        "I do too a little bit.",
        "Hi!",
        "You gave them to me!",
        "All right, I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch.",
        "What bra?",
        "You mean the one that you’re wearing? (Adjusts Monica’s pink bra strap as Monica looks down her shirt.)",
        "What is this?",
        "You’re so sweet. (Notices something in the crib.) Oh my God! And you gave the baby Hugsy! (A stuffed penguin wearing a ski jacket, goggles, and hat.)",
        "But Joey the baby is going to be crying, it’s going to be loud.",
        "It’s gonna be up all night!",
        "It’s gonna poop!",
        "What about all the women you want to bring home?",
        "Joey, are you sure?",
        "I want me to stay too.",
        "Thank you. (They hug.) Oh Joey and look at this crib! It’s so cute!",
        "Are you serious—Really?! It’s in such good condition.",
        "Wow! Whoa-whoa what’s under the covers?",
        "It’s moving.",
        "It’s still—(Screams)—It’s got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!",
        "Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think I’m gonna stay here.",
        "(entering) Hi!",
        "Oh my God! (Notices the boots) Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing!",
        "Return them?! Shh! They’re gonna hear you!",
        "(pause) He’s talking to the baby.",
        "Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. I’ll see you later.",
        "Bye. (She gets up to leave but is stopped by Joey)",
        "Hi.",
        "No, forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren clothes to prison. It is a waste.",
        "I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors…",
        "Really?! Oh my God! I’m successful!",
        "Yes! I’d love to! Have her come by the office.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hi Monica!",
        "Hi boots.",
        "Ahh…",
        "Well-well you can give them to me! I haven’t felt my feet in years!",
        "Oh Joey, I’m hardly a…",
        "Right! Hi Dina!",
        "Nice to meet you. (They shake hands.)",
        "Okay. All right Dina, well let’s talk about the different areas of fashion that you could get involved in. Let’s see, there’s design, but you may need a whole other degree for that. Uh, there’s-there’s sales, which is great because you get to travel…",
        "(stunned) And there’s marketing…",
        "Honey, it’s going to be okay. He’s been incredibly supportive of me, and if he gets a little upset; that’s what the meatball sub is for. (She gives Dina a sandwich wrapped in aluminum foil.)",
        "Okay.",
        "Honey, why don’t you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to tell you.",
        "Joey…there’s something that you…should know. Dina?",
        "(To Dina) Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich! (She quickly sets the sandwich in front of him.)",
        "What?! Dina…",
        "I know.",
        "What college was that Dina?",
        "Joey, what are you doing?",
        "Oh Joey this is crazy!",
        "All right Joey! That is enough! (Grabs him and pulls him away from Bobby and Dina) Listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, it’s not legal. Okay? They-they don’t have a marriage license, they don’t have any witnesses, and the groom only has on one shoe!",
        "You’re supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can make their own decisions.",
        "Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective! (To Bobby and Dina) Right?",
        "Oh, come on kids! A little help here!",
        "Joey, just because they’re not getting married doesn’t mean this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!",
        "Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why don’t you tell us a little bit about your band?",
        "(To Dina) Really? (Nods her head at Bobby.)",
        "Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?",
        "So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?",
        "Okay Bobby, why don’t we just come over here and let them have a little moment. (Drags Bobby away from Joey and Dina.)",
        "No! Seriously! What’s wrong with you?!",
        "(looking at her fingers) Oh my…God! Let me see that! (Grabs the book from him.)",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh Pheebs that’s so sweet—(Grabs a pair of pants)—Ooh, those are so cute!",
        "No.",
        "Wow! I don’t remember him. Honey, are you sure you’re not talking about your imaginary boyfriend.",
        "Oh that’s nice.",
        "Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?",
        "(entering, carrying a baking dish) Hi!",
        "(sees Will) Oh my God Monica, who is that?",
        "Oh! I do not remember him! Wow! He's really got that sexy, smoldering thing going on. (We see Will angrily staring at Rachel.) Oh my God, he’s… Look at the way he’s just staring at me. I think he’s trying to mouth something to me, but I can’t make it out. (Will mouths, \"I hate you.\")",
        "Hi! Will, right?",
        "Hi! I’m Rachel Green.",
        "Really?! Aren’t you sweet! I gotta tell you though, I am, I am having the hardest time placing you. Oh-oh hang on! Did we umm, did we fool around at Lance Davis’ graduation party?",
        "Thank you!",
        "All right, who would uh, like some yams? Will?",
        "What? (Joey starts offering Ross some turkey.) Oh y’know what? Can we please keep the chicken and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table? The smell is just yuck!",
        "I’m sorry. What?",
        "Umm, I’m sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me?",
        "I’m-I’m—I had no idea. I’m sorry. I…",
        "Uh Will umm, I just want to say that I’m real sorry for whatever I-I did to you in high school…",
        "You had a club?!",
        "Whoa! My God! So what, you all just joined together to hate me?! Who else was in this club?",
        "(To Ross) So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?",
        "So who else was in this club?",
        "So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an I Hate Rachel club.",
        "Okay Monica, did you know about this?!",
        "Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?",
        "What rumor?",
        "Ross!",
        "What?!",
        "(shocked) Oh my God!",
        "What?! You heard that?! (Goes and stands behind Joey.)",
        "Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This is why Adam Carter wouldn’t go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region! (Motions to her breasts.) (Joey has turned around.)",
        "Monica, how come you never told me this?!",
        "Joey stop staring! There’s nothing there! It’s not true!",
        "Oh! (Hits him and storms out.)",
        "(entering carrying a book) Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year, \"Dear Rach, you’re such a good person.\" Not girl! Person!",
        "(reading what he wrote again) \"Dear Rach, you’re a great person. Sorry about your tiney-wienie.\" (Will laughs.)",
        "Yes!",
        "I don’t care how long ago it was! You told people that I was half and half! Y’know what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in high school.",
        "What?",
        "Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!",
        "Ohh, there’s a picture of her in the yearbook actually.",
        "Wh—Phoebe!!",
        "All right, y’know—Fine! You guys have your stupid little club, but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you! You gave me a tiney-wienie! (Will laughs.)",
        "Wow…",
        "She’s right.",
        "You can keep those pants by the way.",
        "Phoebe?",
        "Look at that guy by the window, wow!",
        "Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean it’s like every guy I see—I mean look here. (Points behind them) Look at that guy for example, I mean normally that’s not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way I’m feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Really?! So this has happened to you?",
        "Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santa’s lap.",
        "Ah.",
        "Well, y’know what? I go see my doctor tomorrow, I’ll ask her about this. Maybe she can give me a pill or something.",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh, okay. Hey, can I ask you a question? Was it me, or-or was the guy who took my blood sample really cute? Y’know who I’m talking about, bald haircut, hairy fingers… (Stops when she realizes it was her.)",
        "Yes, you are.",
        "Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where are you from? What do you do?",
        "Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? Do you ski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?",
        "Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!",
        "No. I’m very comfortable.",
        "No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!",
        "Well would you like me to lie down on the table?",
        "Do you feel it too?",
        "Hi.",
        "Well, let’s see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.",
        "Okay, even this is turning me on!",
        "Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how’s it, how’s it going with you and Mona? Are you guys still together?",
        "Uh Ross? You asked me that.",
        "I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples through that sweater.",
        "You gave her a key to your apartment?!",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah. (They go into the kitchen.)",
        "What?",
        "Phoebe no!",
        "No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!",
        "Yes. Hi, I’d like to order a pizza. Okay, can I ask you a question? Is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very Ambercrombie & Fitch. (Joey enters.) I’ll call you back.",
        "It’s just the pizza place.",
        "I’m sorry honey, I’m just having a, having a rough day.",
        "Oh you really, you really just don’t want to hear about it.",
        "Okay, it’s just—and this is really embarrassing—but lately with this whole pregnancy thing I’m just finding myself…how do I put this umm, erotically charged.",
        "Yeah. So y’know, I have all of these feelings and I don’t know what to do about them, because I can’t date like a normal person, which is fine because I don’t need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night. Just s*x, y’know? No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feel comfortable with and who knows what he’s doing. For just one great night, I mean is that really so…hard…to find. (Looks at Joey.) So how was your day?",
        "Well, I gotta get up early and it’s almost seven o’clock.",
        "Okay, good night!",
        "(entering) I didn’t ask you to do it!",
        "You’re Joey!",
        "Right back at ya!",
        "And so bad. I don’t even know what you’re talking about because I didn’t ask you to do anything!",
        "No!",
        "That’s the end of this conversation!",
        "Never happened! Good night!",
        "They made you head of the department!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Uh, Paul’s Café. They got great food and it’s really romantic.",
        "Yeah! Oh, and then afterwards you can take her to the Four Seasons for drinks. Or you go downtown and listen to some jazz. Or dancing—Oh! Take her dancing!",
        "Ooh, I miss dating. Gettin’ all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant. I’m not gonna be able to do that for so long, and it’s so much fun! I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.",
        "Huh?",
        "What?! Joey, you don’t want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.",
        "(interrupting) Okay! I’ll go with ya! I’ll go! I’ll go with ya.",
        "All right?",
        "Joey? Could you get that? (There is no answer and she goes and opens the door to Joey.) What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?",
        "Ohh, Lilies. Joey, they’re my favorite. Thank you.",
        "Oh man! This is so great! I actually feel like I’m going on a real date! Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and I’m wearing underwear that goes up to about…(She snaps the waistband on her underwear that is just slightly below her breasts)…there.",
        "Yeah, actually that’s my roommate’s.",
        "Ah yes, but he’s very protective of me so you’d better watch yourself.",
        "Hm-mmm.",
        "(laughs) Yeah, but I’m pretty sure he’s gay.",
        "Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?",
        "Emmm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitute the three-pound lobster?",
        "Wow! This is shaping up to be a pretty good date—Oh, I almost forgot. I didn’t pay you the rent check.",
        "Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do you have any moves?",
        "I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.",
        "Oh my God. And that works?!",
        "Oh, you poor little famous man.",
        "(looks interested) Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic, I almost leaned in. I really almost did!",
        "Alright. So where’d you grow up?",
        "Come on, just answer the question!",
        "And so were-were you close to your parents?",
        "Why not?",
        "(sympathetic) Oh. (Starts rubbing his wrist with her fingers.) It’s gotta be rough.",
        "Huh?",
        "Thank you! And now if you’ll excuse me, I have to go to the rest room.",
        "And now you’re watching me walk away.",
        "I am not gonna answer that!",
        "No one! They are my friends, I wouldn’t punch any of them.",
        "Yeah, but I don’t know why. Look at me, I’m having such a wonderful time!",
        "I know!",
        "Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.",
        "Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.",
        "All right, now don’t judge me. I normally wait until my date leaves, but you live here. I’m ripping into this swan.",
        "So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani’s end of the night moves?",
        "How do you do that?",
        "Oh my God!",
        "No, I don’t want to tell you.",
        "Because it’s embarrassing.",
        "(laughs) Okay. All right, stand up. (They do so.) Well, when we’re at the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a second, and then I make this sound, \"Hmmm.\" Okay, I know it doesn’t sound like anything, but I swear it works.",
        "All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time.",
        "…you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!",
        "Well, why didn’t you just take a cab?",
        "Well you’re not gonna be able to keep doing this.",
        "You what?",
        "Right. Wow!",
        "Hi! Hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie Cujo?",
        "Relax! It’s not like it’s Citizen Kane!",
        "Yeah I know it’s really boring, but it’s like a big deal. Anyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime.",
        "Well don’t you have that big date tonight?",
        "Hey Joey, can I ask you something?",
        "After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?",
        "I don’t know! (Pause) I’m-I’m kinda thinking it-it was the lobster…",
        "Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.",
        "Really?! How come we didn’t cross paths?",
        "Oh God! Thank God you’re home! I’m watching Cujo.",
        "Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!",
        "No! No! Seriously, what’s wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute, what are you doing home so early? What happened to your date?",
        "Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?",
        "Y’know, I never thought I’d say this about a movie, but I really hope this dog dies. (Joey brings over a stool at sits on it next to Rachel who’s in the big chair.) What are you doing over there? Come sit here, you protect me.",
        "Okay. (Pushes play.) Okay, that’s him! That’s him! That’s Cujo! That’s Cujo!",
        "Oh my God….What’s he gonna do now? I can’t watch! (Drags Joey closer to her and cowers into his chest.) Oh. Seriously, how can you watch this? Aren’t you scared?",
        "(coming from her room) Hi, sweetie.",
        "Hi! Oh, Ross, don’t forget, we have that doctor’s appointment tomorrow!",
        "Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!",
        "Popular.",
        "Oh yeah! I’ve come up with a bunch of ideas!",
        "Really?!",
        "Okay! I was thinking if it’s a girl, how about Sandrine? It’s French.",
        "Okay fine, what do you have?",
        "Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.",
        "I’m really, really not.",
        "All right.",
        "Yeah! I don’t think you’re going to need it though. Okay, check this out. If it’s a girl, Rain.",
        "Why?",
        "Ross, why do you hate our child?",
        "Okay, James.",
        "But only if it’s a girl.",
        "Oh! I’m sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?",
        "Veto. Sawyer?",
        "Veto.",
        "Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!",
        "But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whether it’s a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo?",
        "Right. Right.",
        "(looking at the bulletin board with baby pictures) So, which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?",
        "Third one from the left?",
        "What?!",
        "I didn’t!",
        "Okay fine, I did. But I didn’t see anything, I swear.",
        "Okay, but Ross just listen to me…",
        "But I couldn’t even if I wanted to, because I don’t know! I swear; I didn’t see anything, and I don’t want to know! It was just a momentary lapse.",
        "(holding stomach) Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross.",
        "Hey.",
        "You know what? I’ve been thinking about it. I’m really coming around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that.",
        "I didn’t see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.",
        "I would—Sequoia?",
        "Fine.",
        "But Ross, you want the name Ruth!",
        "What?",
        "Ross, I swear, I don’t know.",
        "A what?!",
        "We’re having a girl?",
        "That’s what you just said!",
        "You said girl!",
        "I’m not! We’re having a girl! Sometimes I can’t believe it’s with you—But still! We’re having a girl!",
        "Oh, yes! We’ll have ourselves a little baby Ruth…",
        "Yes, please.",
        "(entering) Hey! Ross and I were looking for you! What are we all doing in here? (Looks at Chandler) Oh, my! (Covers the spot where Joey wants bubbles to be replaced.)",
        "No, I was waiting for you!",
        "We’re having a girl.",
        "(entering) Hi, sweetie.",
        "Oh Joey, I’m so happy things worked out for us that we’re having this baby together. I love you so much.",
        "And I hope it’s not an inappropriate time to say this but, you’re the best s*x I ever had.",
        "(bursts into the room) Joey! Joey!",
        "Come feel this! Come feel my belly!",
        "Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feel this?!",
        "Yes!",
        "Oh, okay! (She goes over to him and he feels her belly.)",
        "Aw, it’s unbelievable! Wow! She is kicking so much! Oh, she’s like umm…oh…who’s that kind of annoying girl soccer player?",
        "Mia Hamm!",
        "(looking down) Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!",
        "It’s not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do (Mimics him) that again.",
        "Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey’s room and he was sleeping…",
        "Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I don’t—Whoa!! (Winces in pain.)",
        "Really?",
        "Okay. Oh God—Ow!—Oo!",
        "Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it you’ve had one of these Braxton thingies?",
        "Thank you doctor. (Dr. Long exits.) (To Joey) Oh thank you for being so nice and calm.",
        "But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.",
        "But I—But everything is okay. I’m fine!",
        "Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctor’s uterus though. Mild discomfort, what’s he talking about?",
        "Yeah, everything’s fine!",
        "Okay, no uterus, no opinion.",
        "Oh you went to the movies by yourself?",
        "Oh, I gotta go back in there.",
        "No, everything’s fine. I just gotta go back…",
        "I-I forgot my underwear. (Ross lets her go.)",
        "Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!",
        "Ohh! That’s so sweet of you! Oh yum! (Takes a bite out of the sandwich and starts to get sick.) Did you put pickles on this?",
        "Oh Ross!! (Runs to the bathroom and closes the door.)",
        "Yeah, I’ll be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?",
        "(entering) Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.",
        "What’s up?",
        "(Gasps) Are you breaking up with us?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?",
        "But Joey, I don’t think Ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. I mean—(Ross turns to her with wishful eyes.)—Or he does.",
        "But Ross, its you and me!",
        "I don’t know. Is it crazy?",
        "Okay, let’s do it. I’ll move in.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh-oh! Okay, she’s kicking!",
        "Whoa!!",
        "Wow that was a big one.",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That’s why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He’ll find me.",
        "(To Phoebe) Well, what’s he like?!",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Of course, of course.",
        "Oh sure. Older?",
        "Oh, I was just gonna ask!",
        "Oh, it’s so sad they never had a chance to meet.",
        "Joey? What’s up?",
        "Okay what’s up?",
        "Well honey, I’m late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?",
        "Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. Okay? (Walks away.)",
        "…and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he touches my stomach. I mean I’m really worried the baby’s not going to like him. (Joey is staring at the table.) Are you okay?",
        "No. Not-not for me, but why don’t you take off your sweater?",
        "Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?",
        "Huh. Wow, I wouldn’t think Hobbs would like that so much.",
        "Um, seven…e-e-eight, eight years. Wow.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So you were saying?",
        "Okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and I said, \"Eight years.\" And the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and umm…now here we are.",
        "(stunned) What?",
        "(looking around) Who are you talking too? Oh, you’re kidding! Oh, it’s a joke! (Laughs.) It’s funny. It’s funny. I don’t get it. (Joey doesn’t say any thing and Rachel realizes it’s not a joke.) Oh. (Pause) Okay. Umm… I-I…uh, wow. Are you uh… How did umm… When?",
        "Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here.",
        "Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I…",
        "Joey.",
        "No! Joey please! Please don’t! Please don’t leave like this! Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman! (Starts to cry.)",
        "Can I? (Hug him.)",
        "Oh Joey honey I don’t…I don’t want to lose…",
        "I’m so sorry.",
        "Yeah, that was a real good one.",
        "Joey? Are you in there?",
        "Hey!",
        "Is Joey here?",
        "Well, at least you make each other laugh.",
        "Well, I haven’t seen him since that night that he told me how he y’know… I don’t know, I think he’s avoiding me. Why is that bagel on the floor?",
        "Ew, was Chandler naked? Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of situation?",
        "All right. Well listen, if you see Joey will you just tell him uh…tell him I miss him. (Exits and Joey enters.)",
        "Okay, I’m done. Do mine.",
        "Ah.",
        "Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.",
        "Well just ask Mona to give it back!",
        "Hi!",
        "Hi.",
        "So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but it’s not even like we know how to be with each other anymore.",
        "How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can’t even be in the same room with each other?!",
        "Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!",
        "Oh yeah. That makes sense.",
        "Ooh, I can do that.",
        "Hi.",
        "What?",
        "Yeah it’s umm… Yeah it’s uh… It-it’s y’know—It’s nothing.",
        "Yeah—No wait! Joey no wait it is. It’s something. It’s-it’s umm…it’s my boss.",
        "Yeah, and umm my baby.",
        "My boss wants to buy my baby!",
        "I know I told you, it’s a really big problem.",
        "Can you believe that?!",
        "That’s what I told him!",
        "Well I’ll tell ya! (Pause) See uh my-my boss and his wife—They-they can’t have children. So umm, and that—we were at the Christmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, \"Rachel, I want to buy your baby.\"",
        "Ohh! Yeah! (Pause) Yeah that-that would’ve been a much simpler problem.",
        "(entering) Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!",
        "Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.",
        "Oh that’s not important. The point is, I really—I think everything’s gonna be okay.",
        "Hey! Oh Joey, honey listen, thank you for talking to my yesterday about that thing with my boss. That really meant a lot.",
        "(worried) What?",
        "Whoa-whoa-whoa, let’s say more!",
        "What?!",
        "No! No, no-no-no Joey he doesn’t want to buy my baby! I made that up!",
        "So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldn’t be awkward!",
        "(To Joey) I can’t believe that you yelled at my boss! I’m-I’m gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!",
        "Oh Joey, I can’t believe you brought my boss into this! I’m gonna get fired!",
        "Well, she told me too! (Points to Monica and Joey glares at her.)",
        "Morning. You wanted to see me?",
        "Okay look Mr. Zelner…",
        "Yeah. (Motions for him to continue.)",
        "Oh God.",
        "Well, as long as we are clear about that. (Exits smugly.)",
        "Hi.",
        "It’s all gonna be okay. They’re just so happy that I’m not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear.",
        "Chandler, can you give us a minute?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Joey, I’m really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to make things…",
        "It kinda worked. I mean y’know, I don’t know about you buy I haven’t thought about our thing since all this.",
        "Yeah I know! I miss that.",
        "My gynecologist tried to kill me.",
        "Hi! Hey, Happy Valentine’s Day!",
        "It’s good. Except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long. Did you know that something really boring happened to someone really ugly in the Middle Ages? (to the waitress handing her a cup of coffee) Oh, thank you. I’ll see you guys later.",
        "(entering) Hi.",
        "I accidentally packed these with my stuff. (looks at the dog and gasps) Who is this?",
        "(talking with a higher voice, and puckered lips…kind of like you do to a baby or...well…a puppy…it’s hard to explain. Just use your imagination!) Oh, well, you are so cute! I wish I could play with you more, but I’ve got to go to work! I hope I stop talking like this before my marketing meeting, yes I do. Yes I do. (still talking like that) Bye-bye, Joey. Oh, I seriously can’t stop it. (exits)",
        "Oh, I’ve got big Valentine’s plans! I’ve got my Chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!",
        "Ross, we actually watched the documentary together.",
        "Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash! (runs to her room to get her money)",
        "(entering) Oh, hey, Mona!",
        "I’ll be watching TV if anybody needs me. (exits to her room)",
        "I’m not here! That’s just my Chinese food!",
        "You know what I’m going to do? I’m going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed! (exits)",
        "(entering) I’m just going to grab the phone.",
        "Oh, I’m sorry! Do you need the phone?",
        "(as Ross enters with a present) But, but, Mona, I live here.",
        "(entering) Hi! I’m so sorry to barge in on your Valentine’s, but I had to get away from all the yelling. Mona is dumping Ross.",
        "Why? You saw it? Is it scary?",
        "Well, now, wait. Now I’m all freaked out. Come on, you guys will watch it with me.",
        "C’mon, seriously, you guys, you’re not going to make me watch this alone!",
        "Okay. (watching the tape) Ooh, my! (Rachel jumps when the woman starts screaming) Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!",
        "Uh! It’s horrible!",
        "Oh, my God!",
        "What? Did her ass explode?!",
        "Oh, screw you guys, you don’t have to do it!",
        "(thinking) You’re going to have a baby, and you need to be prepared. Now, you’re going to make yourself watch the whole thing. Just do it! (Rachel puts the tape in the VCR)",
        "(thinking) Hmm…maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.",
        "Hi!",
        "Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?",
        "I, uh, think you already are.",
        "Yeah, yeah I like him a lot.",
        "Yeah, otherwise I’m not going.",
        "This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?",
        "Hmmm….",
        "Thank you…we’re so excited",
        "What?!",
        "Yeah, if you’re going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nosal area.",
        "No, I know I don’t either, but ya know what, it’s their party, and it’s just one night. And we don’t even have to lie; we just won’t say anything. If it comes up again, we’ll just…smile. We’ll nod along.",
        "Hmmmm….",
        "Oh…",
        "(looking at the check) Unbelievable!",
        "Open it! Open it! Open it!",
        "But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.",
        "On a cliff, in Barbados, at sunset, and Stevie Wonder sang Isn’t She Lovely as I walked down the aisle.",
        "Yeah, Stevie’s an old family friend. (Hits Ross’s chest)",
        "So would I. You wouldn’t think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.",
        "What? I’m not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want it to be amazing.",
        "Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.",
        "And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns.",
        "Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight, it was all worth it.",
        "Well, I don’t know about that, but some said that I looked like a floating angel.",
        "Oh yeah. That’s a great story.",
        "Shhh! I want to hear the rest!",
        "And the ring, was the size of my fist (makes a fist)!",
        "Ross, it just wouldn’t have been feasible.",
        "It was really fun being married to you tonight.",
        "Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?",
        "That proposal, at the planetarium…",
        "Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! It was…really wonderful! Did you just make that up?",
        "Well, that would’ve been very hard to say no too.",
        "Goodnight",
        "I will think about it.",
        "Hi!",
        "So, I’m in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digest crossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down. (She hands the magazine to Joey.)",
        "So did they call you to tell you your name’s gonna be in this?",
        "Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus y’know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention, oh I don’t know, gal pal Rachel Green?",
        "Okay, don’t listen to him. Please?",
        "Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal Rachel Green. (Excited) Ha-ha! I’m gonna be in Soap Opera Digest! And not just in the dumb crossword puzzle. (Looks at Joey.) Seriously, proud of you.",
        "Oh yeah, I’d actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea.",
        "That is the Coast Guard.",
        "It’s a trifle. It’s got all of these layers. First there’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch. [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sautéed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something’s wrong.] then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!",
        "Oh! Yay! Look! There’s a piece that doesn’t have floor on it!",
        "Hey, come on now!",
        "(interrupting him) Hi! I’m gal pal Rachel Green, and if you want the dirt, I’m the one you come too. This might be Joey’s baby (rubbing her stomach), who knows? I’m just kidding—Seriously, (leans into the cassette recorder Shelley is using) gal pal Rachel Green.",
        "(scoffs at him) Yeah, that’s gonna get you into Soap Opera Digest. Well I…(leans into the microphone again)…I would just like to say that Joey truly has enriched the days of our lives.",
        "You too!",
        "Oh, Joey! Sorry!",
        "Oh but look! That’s gonna leave a stain!",
        "Really?",
        "I’ve never lived like this before.",
        "Ewwww!!",
        "(turning to look at Joey) Ewwww!!",
        "Oh my God, Jill!",
        "This is Chandler. (Points at him.)",
        "And you know Monica and Ross!",
        "And that’s Phoebe (points), and that’s Joey.",
        "Don’t!! (Joey backs away frightened.)",
        "Yeah!",
        "Wow! I can’t believe they didn’t put it in the part where you said you didn’t watch soap operas.",
        "Yeah but y’know what they say Mon, \"There’s no such thing as bad press.\"",
        "I didn’t write it.",
        "Ross!",
        "I am freaking out!",
        "My due date is in one week!",
        "That is seven days!",
        "(interrupting him) No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please, come on we do not have any of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do not have a diaper service!",
        "I’m serious.",
        "Okay. Thank you. That’s great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west 10th? Because there’s this really cute shoe store that has like this little…",
        "(stopping him) Oh, wait Ross! I’m sorry, one more thing!",
        "Umm, our situation. Y’know umm, what we mean to each other. And I mean we-we’re having this baby together, and we live together. Isn’t that, isn’t that weird?",
        "I’m just kidding! You can go pee! (He does so in a hurry.)",
        "Oh.",
        "No-no-no! No, no, no, we’re not married.",
        "Oh yeah! Actually, that’s one of the reasons why we’re not a couple.",
        "Oh. Oh yeah, don’t get to worked up over it. I mean it-it sounds like he’s a doctor, but he’s not.",
        "Oh my God! I’m standing at a cash register, holding a credit card, and I’m bored.",
        "Hi Pheebs!",
        "Oh, it was great! We got everything that we needed! Oh and Ross, almost got something that wasn’t on the list. A whore.",
        "Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started flirting with him.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You don’t understand! You didn’t see how brazen she was.",
        "No! I’m not! I-I-I just think it’s wrong! It’s-it’s that I’m—Here I am about to pop and he’s out picking up some shop girl at Sluts ‘R’ Us!",
        "Oh yeah! You really—You look great.",
        "Chandler, I’m not gonna lie to ya, but I am gonna run away from you. (Gets up and hurries out.)",
        "All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?",
        "Horny bitch. (They both look at her, pretending that the dinosaurs she’s holding are arguing.) No! You’re a horny bitch! Noooo! You’re the horny bitch! No! You’re a horny bitch!",
        "So you guys go, have a really good time.",
        "So, you had a good day huh? Big commission; picked up a daddy.",
        "Oh yeah! Yeah please, you guys have fun.",
        "Oh and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic, although you missed a button.",
        "Oh okay, I see what you’re doing there.",
        "Hi! You’re back from your date!",
        "I’m fine, but that’s not important. What’s important is how was she?",
        "Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table.",
        "No! No, she’s—She was nice. I mean, she’s a little slutty, but who isn’t?",
        "Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you Indiana Jones!",
        "No! It’s just that, Kate bothered me.",
        "There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely!",
        "I don’t want you to date her!",
        "Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I don’t want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it’s a terrible thing to even think this, and it’s completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at my constant beck and call 24 hours a day! I’m very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel.",
        "What?!",
        "Really? But I’m being so unreasonable.",
        "(starting to cry) Oh Ross, thank you. Thank you. (They hug.)",
        "No, not really. You’re pressing the baby into my bladder and now I have to pee. Sorry. (She gets up and starts for the bathroom.)",
        "Yeah. (Stops and starts doing the I-have-to-go-to-the-bathroom dance.)",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "(pause) Wow! I don’t know, maybe. I’m…",
        "(laughs) I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin’ with you too!",
        "Oh no-no-no-no, no!",
        "No that’s just—(Laughs)—That’s just ‘cause I’m such a good messer!",
        "Yeah?",
        "Right! (Heads for the bathroom.)",
        "(entering) Hi!",
        "So what’s the final head count on my baby shower?",
        "What?! You mean they’re not coming to a social event where there’s no men and there’s no booze?! That’s shocking! I don’t care, as long as my mom’s here.",
        "What?! My mom’s not gonna be here?!",
        "My God!",
        "So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!",
        "Please, make sure she comes. It’s really important to me, I mean it’s my mom!",
        "I don’t know.",
        "Okay. (Mrs. Green helps her up and they walk over and get some tea.)",
        "Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh, I don’t even have a housekeeper.",
        "Mrs. Kay! Oh yeah, she was sweet. She taught me Spanish. I actually think I remember some of it, tu madre es loca. (I think that’s your mother’s crazy.)",
        "Well, however great she was I just can’t afford that.",
        "What?",
        "Wh-wh-what? What?",
        "Yes. Yes I do.",
        "Why did you invite my mother?!",
        "She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby.",
        "Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with her is taxing.",
        "What? You guys, come on! What am I going to do?",
        "You’re right. You’re right. I mean I’m about to have a baby, I can tell my mother that I don’t want her to just be sleeping on my couch! Oh my God! She’s gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. This cannot happen!",
        "Okay. (She goes over to tell her mother.)",
        "Mom that’s okay that you didn’t get you a gift!",
        "Oh yeah. Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own.",
        "But mom, I really know what I’m doing. I can handle this.",
        "He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!",
        "Wow!",
        "Oh my gosh! Oh wow! Oh, I know what this is! (She’s holding an item with a large suction cup connected to a yellow plastic box, with a long narrow tube and bottle connected the yellow part.) Wait a minute. That can’t be right. Is that a beer bong for a baby?",
        "Did I say I was done guessing? Okay, thank you for that. Oh wow! What’s this?",
        "Oh, it dispenses clean diapers!",
        "Well that’s gross, why don’t you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster?",
        "What?! It goes ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! Indian food?!",
        "I don’t know, I’d leave it on the changing table? (Everyone gasps.) What?! What’d I do? What’d I do?!",
        "Oh come—(Stutters)—Of course I know that. I mean of course you never leave a baby alone! I mean who would—she wouldn’t be safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy. Oh God, okay. Y’know what? I think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now. So I think umm, I’m just gonna maybe open them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. And for these beautiful gifts, and this basket is beautiful.",
        "Okay mommy, don’t ever leave me. (Hugs her.)",
        "So umm, you’re gonna stay with me as long as I need you?",
        "Oh mom, I swear I’m not an idiot. I’ve read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didn’t think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes. And-and then guess what? The baby’s coming and I don’t know what to do. Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?",
        "Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.",
        "No. She’s going to live with us for eight weeks.",
        "Yes! She’s gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo. (Sees that Ross isn’t happy.)",
        "I do. I really do. I don’t know anything.",
        "Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?",
        "Hello?! I still don’t know what the hell I’m doing!",
        "I hope you’re going somewhere with this.",
        "Really?",
        "Thank you. (Hugs him.)",
        "(closing a book) Okay! I’m ready.",
        "Yes, I’ve done my studying and I really know my stuff.",
        "Uh, put your elbow in it.",
        "Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.",
        "Check if it’s wet, check if it’s hungry, burp it!",
        "A card! A card! I pick a card!",
        "Well obviously I won’t be able to come, for those of you who haven’t checked their calendars today is my due date. Well y’know, I just want to take a moment and thank you guys for how great you’ve been during this time. I really couldn’t have done it without you. And I have loved these last nine months! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part, I am really gonna miss being pregnant.",
        "That’s right, still no baby! (To Monica, Joey, and Chandler on the couch) Come on people! Please make some room!",
        "You. Like you haven’t done enough.",
        "God. (Sits down.) I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!",
        "(interrupting her) Oh Phoebe, that’s a great story. Can you tell it to me when you’re getting me some iced tea? (Phoebe gets up and Rachel groans.) (To the baby) Oh God, get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get out!!",
        "Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? ‘Cause I’ll do it.",
        "They sent me home from work. They were like, \"Start your maternity leave now! Just rest, get ready for the baby.\" Well y’know what? Screw ‘em! If they don’t want me there, I’ll just hang out with you guys.",
        "(overhearing that) What-what about me?",
        "I don’t. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just because I’m pregnant you think I’m invisible.",
        "Oh, I have to pee. If I don’t come out in five minutes it’s because I’ve choked to death on the potpourri stink. (Goes into the bathroom.)",
        "(calling from the bathroom) All right, who’s turn is it to help me get up!",
        "Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy. (Goes to the bathroom.)",
        "In a minute!!!",
        "(entering) All right, all right. Let’s go!",
        "No, I’m fine.",
        "Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am somewhat comfortable.",
        "Oh uh-uh pal! Don’t call me mommy! It’s bad enough you call your own mother that. (He looks at Monica.)",
        "Ross.",
        "Can I ask you something?",
        "When Carol was pregnant with Ben…",
        "…were you this irritating?",
        "Excuse me?!",
        "Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.",
        "(silently) Okay. (Pause) Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That’s great!",
        "Hi Dr. Long, how are you?",
        "She has the drugs!",
        "Okay. (Rachel lies back.)",
        "Yeah.",
        "Eh, just a tad.",
        "Well, we are ready to try anything.",
        "Okay.",
        "Great! We will do all of those.",
        "Hi!",
        "No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.",
        "Well, there is one thing that we haven’t tried, but someone thinks that, (mimicking Ross) \"That will open up a can of worms.\"",
        "Why? Why today?",
        "I’ll take that bet.",
        "Well, I’m miserable here! I might as well make some money out it!",
        "Oh honey, don’t worry. I really do feel like tomorrow’s the day.",
        "Ross I—We tried all the spicy food. It’s not working.",
        "I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have s*x with you.",
        "Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We know what’s gonna work! It’s doctor recommended!",
        "Oh come on Ross, we’ve done it before we’ll do it again, it’ll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.",
        "Make love? What are you a girl?",
        "But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle, y’know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out.",
        "Oh, I know it. You’re right. That’s not sexy. Oh…Oh! (Drops a fork on the floor.) Whoops! Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork. Let me just bed over and get it. (Tries too, but can’t quite seem to make it.) Oh God!",
        "Come on Ross! I’m miserable here! Come on! You started this, now you finish it! Come on wuss, make love to me.",
        "What?!",
        "Oh wow! What now Ross you’re not gonna talk? How on earth will you ever annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know. (Mimics his breathing.) I mean you’d think the damn jalepeno would’ve cleared up your sinuses, but no!! That’s not enough… (Ross jumps over and kisses her.) What are you doing?!",
        "(breaking the kiss) Oh God!",
        "Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke.",
        "Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay!",
        "Yeah.",
        "I didn’t uh, really have time to read this part of the books, but do you think we have time to…",
        "Okay.",
        "Joey.",
        "(seeing the ring) Oh my God. (Pause) Okay.",
        "So uh…I guess we should…make it official huh?",
        "Hey you.",
        "Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.",
        "I know, I still need to talk to you.",
        "Hi.",
        "Uhh… I think I just got engaged.",
        "Well…did you know he was gonna ask me?",
        "And you really think this is a good idea?",
        "I just don’t know! It just doesn’t feel right.",
        "Really?! Even Ross?",
        "I guess so.",
        "I can’t say that I’m surprised.",
        "Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I…it’s beautiful I love it!",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won’t take my breast?",
        "Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.",
        "I’m sorry honey, what were you saying?",
        "Oh look, she’s pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth? (Joey gets embarrassed.) She looks scared. Doesn’t she look scared?",
        "It’s just so frustrating! Why doesn’t she want my breast?!",
        "Hey. I need to tell you something.",
        "Joey asked me marry him.",
        "Joey proposed to me.",
        "Well, I-I said yes.",
        "I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.",
        "Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.",
        "Sure.",
        "Yeah, I mean whatever.",
        "No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?",
        "Hey.",
        "Surprised?",
        "I know.",
        "You didn’t propose to me. Joey did.",
        "Uh… You didn’t propose to me, Chandler didn’t propose to me, but Joey did.",
        "Yes you did!",
        "Well then why did you give me a ring?",
        "Yes, you did!",
        "Yes, you did!",
        "Yes, you did! And don’t you say, \"No, I didn’t!\"",
        "He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.",
        "Yeah, what did happen?",
        "Yeah, but you said, \"Will you marry me?\"",
        "Yes, you did!",
        "Yes, you did—Oh my God you didn’t! (Screams) Well then why didn’t you tell me that before?!",
        "Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!",
        "You were gonna propose to me?",
        "Okay.",

        "She’s doing it Look, she’s breast-feeding look!",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh wow, this feels weird.",
        "Wonderful weird.",
        "Honey don’t worry, it was my mistake.",
        "She’s perfect.",
        "We really are.",
        "I know. I know. I’ve feeling…",
        "Yeah. (Laughs nervously)",
        "Yeah, maybe.",
        "Wh-what’s that?",
        "I’m sorry, what?",
        "(deadpan) Yes, the hard part is truly over.",
        "Hi! (Ross is stunned.)",
        "Ross, you stay here and talk, I’m gonna go have a baby.",
        "(interrupting her) Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I’m sorry, semi-private? We (Laughs), we asked for a private room.",
        "Okay. Just give us a second. Ross! (They walk away from the desk.)",
        "Give her some money.",
        "They’re not!! Ross, they’re just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!",
        "(standing up) Okay. Y’know what? I’d have to say I really don’t care for your tone. And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem to—Whoa! (She starts a contraction) Oh gosh! Whoa!",
        "Ow! Ow! Contraction. (Sits back down.) Ow-ow! Ow-ow! (Starts breathing heavily.)",
        "Yeah, it couldn’t hurt to look.",
        "Oh, okay.",
        "Thank you. (Dr. Long exits.) Well, I guess we have some time to kill.",
        "Yeah well it looks great!",
        "Hi!",
        "How are you?",
        "Yeah it is.",
        "That’s so sweet.",
        "Oh.",
        "Oh no, I really don’t want any—(He takes the picture)—Oh! Thank you. Oh. Oh Ross…",
        "Here comes another contraction.",
        "Oh, that’s very—Really very-very okay.",
        "(simultaneously as Ross) No, I don’t think we’ll be doing that.",
        "Oh. Oh wait no.",
        "No-no-don’t! Don’t leave me here with these people.",
        "No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh, thank you so much for coming. Ross, get in here!",
        "New people.",
        "They’re having their baby! It’s not fair Ross we got here first! Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery. Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.",
        "Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other. Including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick b*st*rd. Oh God oh! Contraction!",
        "Ooh! Ow!!",
        "Ross.",
        "He’s looking at me.",
        "Ugh, is she pregnant yet? She doesn’t need to be; she’ll still have the baby before I do. Oh Ross, another contraction! (Leans back on Ross for some support.)",
        "Yeah it was.",
        "Dr. Long, I’ve been at this for seventeen hours! Three women have come and gone with their babies, you gotta give me some good news! How many centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?",
        "Hey, y’know what? I’m not waiting! I’m gonna push this baby out! I’m doing it! I mean it’s what? Three centimeters? That’s gotta be like this! (Holds her hands a couple inches apart.)",
        "Oh stupid metric system!",
        "Oh for the love of God!",
        "Oh come on!!",
        "Okay! Okay wait! You listen to me! You listen to me! Since I have been waiting four women, that’s four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, have come and gone with their babies! I’m next! It’s my turn! It’s only fair! And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I’m going to sue you! Not this hospital, I’m going to sue you! And my husband (Points at Ross) he’s a lawyer!",
        "Go get back on that case honey!",
        "Okay, well then bring her in.",
        "Oh!",
        "I get it!",
        "Oh we-we didn’t.",
        "Just tell me how.",
        "Oh hi.",
        "Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when you’re trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?",
        "Oh that’s five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesn’t she want to come out?",
        "Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God! (Starts another contraction as Dr. Long enters.)",
        "Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.",
        "What?",
        "My God. Okay. (Another woman enters.) Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!",
        "3-2-1 oh!!",
        "I can’t. I can’t push anymore, I can’t.",
        "Oh God twenty seconds my ass!!",
        "Don’t say, \"Oh my God!\" Oh my God what?",
        "Oh God. Is she gonna be okay?",
        "I’m sorry, I can’t!",
        "I can’t!",
        "I can’t. Please, you do it for me.",
        "Are you okay?",
        "Oh God!",
        "Oh, she’s so tiny. (Starts crying) Where’d she go?",
        "Okay. Well be careful with her, she’s really tiny.",
        "Oh hey you. Thanks for coming out of me. (The baby cries.) I know. Oh. Yeah. Oh, she’s looking at me. Hi! I know you.",
        "No, not yet.",
        "Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.",
        "Hello baby girl.",
        "Here. (Hands her to Monica.)",
        "What?",
        "Oh nothing I… Sorry, I just can’t stop crying.",
        "So? You guys are all sleep deprived. I don’t see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet. Oh God. (Starts to cry harder.)",
        "I was reliving it.",
        "Yeah, and y’know what? I love them both, so why don’t you just pick one and that’ll be it.",
        "That’s not her name! I’m sorry, she just doesn’t feel like an Isabella.",
        "Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.",
        "Well what are we going to do?",
        "Well tell us! What are they?",
        "And if it’s a girl?",
        "Oh, just tell us! We’re not gonna want it!",
        "(gasps) Emma! (Looks at the baby and starts to cry.) See? I don’t want it.",
        "What?",
        "Oh honey, but you love that name.",
        "Ohhh! (Looks at Aaron and recoils in horror.) Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesn’t he?",
        "Oh, I’m fine. (Gasps in pain as she sits down.)",
        "Oh, I’m not doing it alone. I have Ross.",
        "Well then he gets a divorce, it’s Ross!",
        "Well I—That’s never gonna happen with Ross.",
        "Really?",
        "Well… That’s…y’know—That’s—We’ve been alone for the last twenty minutes we’re doing okay. Besides y’know what? I-I—Maybe we won’t be alone, ‘cause lately I-I—things have been happening between me and Ross, y’know? Right before I went into labor, we-we had this kiss. Y’know? So it might be the…the beginning of something.",
        "Uh-huh. (Ross takes off his coat and sets in on a chair.) Y’know what I was, I was thinking about?",
        "Umm…that kiss before we left the apartment. That was some-something huh?",
        "(pause) Right.",
        "No! No, of course not. No. That’s why I brought it up. (Pause) They didn’t have any sodas?",
        "That’s all right. (He goes to get her a soda.) And so it begins.",
        "Nothing.",
        "Really it’s nothing. I’m just…",
        "I’ve just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.",
        "Oh please, he’ll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.",
        "I’m just saying that y’know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and…he’s gonna have his own life. Right?",
        "I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?",
        "Joey. Honey what would I do without you?",
        "Oh, hon can you grab me my other box of tissues? They’re right on that chair under Ross’s coat.",
        "Okay.",
        "Joey.",
        "(seeing the ring) Oh my God. (Pause) Okay.",
        "Okay you have to realize, I was exhausted, I was emotional, I would have said yes to anybody. Like that time you and I got married! (Pause) I’m not helping.",
        "That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but I am prepared to let that go.",
        "Well—Really? I thought Chandler was your best friend.",
        "Ooooo!",
        "(enters with Emma) Hi!",
        "Oh you guys thanks for doing this.",
        "Oh Ah! (Sees a big stuffed gorilla) Oh my gosh there’s something every mother needs, a giant stuffed gorilla that takes up the entire apartment! What are people think… (Reads the card) Oh you guys I love it.",
        "He’s downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.",
        "Well, you more then me, but he can’t stay to mad at me. I mean, I just had his baby.",
        "Yeah, I’m not so sure you should be here when he comes up.",
        "Oh great, the pacifiers?",
        "The burping clogs?",
        "The diapers?",
        "Alright thanks, oh Ross could you stop by the coffee house and get me a muffin?",
        "Umm let me think...What do I want, what d-o I w-a-n-t...",
        "Blueberry.",
        "Thanks.",
        "God how long do you think that’s gonna last?",
        "Y’know I can’t even worry about that right now, cause I got the cutie little baby, oh I can’t believe how much I love her, I can’t get enough of her, like right now I miss her. I actually miss her.",
        "Oh god look at her sleeping. Oh, I love her so much! Oh, I think I’m gonna wake her up.",
        "Well I can do whatever I want! I made her! (Waking Emma up.) Come on little girl, hi!",
        "Oh I’m sorry mummy’s so sorry go back to sleep go back to sleep. Shh. Shhh! Go back to sleep",
        "Ok. (Starts swinging Emma rapidly and she stops crying)",
        "Oh (happy) oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit. (Emma starts crying again.) Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it won’t stop crying.",
        "Yeah, I’m not so sure.",
        "I already fed her.",
        "Oh no, you guys, just stay here, I’m gonna go check her diaper, Pheebs you wanna come?",
        "Oh my God! How long has she been crying?",
        "You guys, I’m doing the best I can, anyone else is welcome to try.",
        "Here you go. (Hands Emma to Phoebe)",
        "Oh god what am I gonna do you guys, I can’t even comfort my own baby! I’m the worst mother ever!",
        "Yeah I don’t think dressing provocatively is going to help me here! Oh my god just please take her.",
        "I have to go to the bathroom. (Goes to the bathroom)",
        "Oh my God! You got her to stop crying!",
        "You are the official baby crier stopper!",
        "You’re never leaving the apartment!",
        "That’s your new job, day and night, she starts crying I need you here.",
        "Okay so listen I’m gonna go lay down.",
        "You know the book says that whenever she’s sleeping I should be sleeping so… (She gives Monica thumbs and goes to lay down)",
        "Heeeeey, where have you been? (He shows her his thumb) What happened to you?",
        "Oh no Ross! This is not good, we have to talk about this Joey thing. Please sit. (He sits) You have got to get over this Joey thing, okay? I never really wanted to marry Joey, okay?",
        "You know what I really really want?",
        "I wanna sleep, I wanna eat, I wanna take a shower, I mean before she wakes up and we gotta do this all over again.",
        "I mean I got news for you mister, Emma? Not easy.",
        "No its really okay… Monica!",

        "well watching sharks? Are you sure that's what he was doing?",
        "man sharks. I always knew there was something weird about that dude. But you promised to love him no matter what.",
        "Ah! You know what honey guys are just different, they like things that we can't understand, you know I once dated this guy who wanted to pretend he was an archeologist and I was a naughty cave woman that he unfroze from a block of ice.",
        "yeah I didn't disguise that very well did i.",
        "(sits down) Hi",
        "so basically you've slept with all the woman in New York and now you're just going around again.",
        "what, how do we know, we never slept with you.",
        "yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember who you've slept with, you're made for each other.",
        "(Ross and Rachel enter)\nHi!\nRoss: Hey! So what's the big news you had us rush all the way over here for?\nChandler: Okay, our news. My company has asked me to head up our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated.\nRoss: Oh my God!\nPhoebe: What?!\nRachel: What?!\nRoss: Monday?!\nJoey: How long do you have to go for?\nChandler: They said it could be up to a year.\nJoey: A year?!\nRachel: (To Monica) Do you have to go?\nMonica: I kind of have to don't I? Because of this stupid thing (Points to her wedding ring.)\nChandler: There is nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh?\nJoey: Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot, but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week.\nChandler: I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it.\nJoey: We were gonna go see the Jets!\nRoss: You can't go, I mean you're the glue that holds this group together!\nChandler: Really?\nRoss: Not you.\nJoey: I can't believe you guys are moving.\nPhoebe: I call their apartment!!!\nEveryone: No!!! Ah!! Ahh!!!",
        "Here you are (Hands Rachel a cup of coffee)\nRachel: Thank you Joey. You know what? I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.\nRoss: I went thru this with Ben and Carol. One cup of coffee won't affect your milk.\nRachel: Yeah. Just to be sure I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.\nJoey: (Laughs)\nRachel: Every time? (She takes up her cell phone and starts dialing.)\nJoey: Uhuh.\nRoss: Rach, you don't have to call whenever you have a little question, okay? Trust me, I know this.\nRachel: All right, I trust you. (Continues to dial)\nRoss: Rachel, I can see you dialing! I don't understand why...\nRachel: I'm on the phone! (On the phone) Dr. Wiener? (Ross and Rachel walk away)\nJoey: (Laughs)\nPhoebe: It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby. It's just so grown up.\nJoey: I know, yeah. I feel like we're all growing up. Person named Wiener, God that kills me. (Laughs)\nPhoebe: Look at you all grown up.\nJoey: Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship. You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot.\nPhoebe: You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you set me up with someone, and we double date!\nJoey: I can do that, yeah. How is Friday?\nPhoebe: Done. Oh good, really?\nJoey: Yeah!\nPhoebe: Let's see! (Opens her address book.) Oh, you know who's great? Sandy Poophack.\nJoey: (Laughs) Poophack... (Laughs)\nPhoebe: Yeah... All right, well that rules out Lana Titweiller\nJoey: (Laughs)",
        "(On the phone) Excuse me? Oh yeah? Well, up yours too! (Hangs up)\nRoss: (Enters from his bedroom)Who the hell was that?!\nRachel: Dr. Wiener.\nRoss: Rach, you can't call people at three in the morning.\nRachel: Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!\nRoss: Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?\nRachel: Yes, of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane!\nRoss: Well, what was it?\nRachel: Hiccups.\nRoss: Rach, I told you, you can't call him every time any little thing comes up.\nRachel: Yeah well, not anymore I can't. He fired us! What are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name?\nRoss: Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a good idea. In fact, I think he's dead.\nRachel: Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!\nRoss: Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well.\nRachel: What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well? What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had that shot.\nRoss: You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like! (Walks back into his room.)\nRachel: (Grabs the phone and stars dialing) (On phone) (In a high pitch voice) Wiener, Wiener (In a low pitch voice) Wiener, Wiener!!!\nRoss: (Comes back into the living room) Rachel!!!\nRachel: Great! Now he's gonna know it was me!",
        "It's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their pen1s against your knee?\nMonica: Excuse me?\nChandler: I know what she's talking about.\nRachel: We've got to find a new pediatrician. Ross was getting sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it.\nMonica: Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?\nRachel: Ross said he died.\nMonica: He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.\nRachel: Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.\nMonica: Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist.\nChandler: He saw a therapist?\nMonica: Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just really freaked him out.\nRachel: Why? What was it?\nMonica: That I was going to eat him.",
        "Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment for Emma.\nReceptionist: Dr. Gettleman is finishing up with a patient, he should be out shortly.\nDr. Gettleman: (To a patient) I think you just have a cold, it's definitely not Strep.\nRoss: Thanks doctor.\nDr. Gettleman: Would you like a lollypop?\nRoss: You even have to ask?! (He grabs a lollypop out of a jar) (Sees Rachel) (To Rachel) He is alive!",
        "Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do.\nMonica: You're right. (Pause) Maybe I shouldn't go.\nChandler: What?\nMonica: So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javo (sp?). It's just a little outside of Tulsa.\nChandler: How far outside?\nMonica: Manhattan.\nChandler: And you're thinking of taking it? (Pause) So before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now it's old job, (Raises his hand) me, (Raises his hand) new job.\nMonica: I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.\nChandler: What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?\nMonica: Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.\nChandler: I think you should take the job.\nMonica: Really?\nChandler: Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.\nMonica: That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!\n(Ross and Rachel enter with Emma.)\nRoss: Hey!\nMonica: How was the pediatrician?\nRachel: Oh, I really liked him. (Looks at Ross) Yeah, it was really, really, really good.\nRoss: You promised you wouldn't say anything.\nRachel: I know. (Pause) Ross still sees his pediatrician!!! (To Ross) I don't care!\nMonica: Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?\nRoss: He's a brilliant diagnostician!\nChandler: Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?\nRachel: Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.\nRoss: Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'\nChandler: Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?\nRoss: Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!\nChandler: That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!\nRoss: It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!",
        "(Enters) Oh good, you haven't left yet.\nMonica: Where have you been?\nRoss: I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office. There was some guy that freaked everybody out.\nChandler: Well, you got here just in time. I really have to go buddy. (They hug)\nRoss: Oh man.\nMonica: Promise to call me when you land.\nChandler: Of course I will call you. I love you.\nMonica: I love you too. (They kiss)\nRachel: Okay, wow, wow, wow. Watch the tongue people, we've got a baby over here.\nPhoebe: Bye Chandler.\nChandler: Awww. (They hug) Bye!\nRachel: Bye honey. (They hug)\nChandler: (Tries to hug Joey but J. moves away) What's the matter Joe?\nJoey: I'm mad at you for leaving! You're nothing but a big leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.\nChandler: Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?\nJoey: Dude, you see right thru me!! (They hug) (Joey heads for the door and pushes Chandler's suitcase on the way out.)\nChandler: Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!\nPhoebe: Okay, bye-bye! (Pushes Chandler out the door.) Good trip! (Slams the door)\nMonica: (Runs out to the hallway) Chandler, wait. It goes: Old job, (Raises her hand) new job, (Raises her hand really high) you. This is just something I have to do.\nChandler: I know.\nMonica: I love you so much.\nChandler: I know that too. (They kiss)\n(Joey opens the door and takes Chandler's suitcase into his own apartment.)",
        "Pheebs, I would make a reservation for five, because one of us has to stay home and watch Emma. (to Ross:) Which one of us should go to dinner?",

        "Okay, well that's now the third sign that I should not leave Emma.",
        "Well, let's see. The first one is: I don't want to. And, you know, I'm not going.",

        "Is the window open? Because if there's a window open, a bird could fly in there.",
        "Ubb.",
        "Boy, are you gonna be sorry if that's true.",
        "Och, god. (seeing Emma) Oh, thank god, you're okay. I'm so sorry we left you. Mom never gonna leave you again. Never ever ever again. Uch.",
        "Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, I'm never leaving her again.",
        "(entering) Hey, hi, hi!",
        "We got locked out of the apartment, we ...",
        "N-it wasn't easy, but it's your birthday and I did what I got to do.",
        "Oh honey, this is for the best, thus I'm not distracted, worrying about Emma, how she's doing at home and I'm being completely here with you and, oh, she spit up!",
        "She spit up. Judy! She spi...Judy! Look alive, Judy! (they sit down) Thank you.",
        "Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave? What should I have?",
        "Yah, I'll have the soup and the salmon.",
        "Y'guys ever heard the story about when Ross's mom went to the beauty salon?",
        "(lifts for a toast) Okay, as everybody has ordered, I would like to start the celebration and make a toast ... to Phoebe. She dropped her sock.",
        "N-no, Emma dropped her sock.",
        "Ross, she still has not noticed that the baby's sock is on the ground.",
        "(to Ross) Could you please get her attention?",
        "Phoebe, hi, we're so sorry. You're totally right. We are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration.",
        "What?",
        "Oh thank god, if Phoebe's going, can we please take Emma home?",
        "Oh yeah, she can't be herself.",
        "Yeah, totally! You are in such good hands. And I'm so good with\nmeeting parents. With the father, you know, you want to flirt a little bit,\nbut not in a gross way. Just kind of like: \"Oh mr. Pincer, I can see where\nWallis gets his good looks...\"",
        "Uh, he took the SAT's for me.",
        "Ssshyeah, well, duh! I mean...",
        "Oh, with the mother, just... just constantly tell her how amazing\nher son is. Take it from me, moms love me. Ross's mom one time actually said\nI'm like the daughter that she never had.",
        "Hi.",
        "I just finished getting Phoebe all dressed to meet Mike's parents.\nShe's so nervous, it's so sweet!",
        "(in disbelief) You WHAT? And I missed it? Because I was giving a\nmakeover to that stupid hippie?",
        "Well... well, what did you do to make her laugh? (excited)",
        "You WHAT? You sang... to our baby daughter... a song about a guy who\nlikes to have s*x with women with giant asses?",
        "(disgusted) owwwww...",
        "Okay... aahhh... Please laugh for mommy... Please? Please laugh for\nmommy... (Rachel makes a funny face, sticking her tongue out, making a\nfarting noise and using her hands as antlers, wiggling her fingers... No\nresponse from Emma...) Not funny huh? Oh so, is it... only offensive novelty\nrap? Or maybe just, you know, rap in general? 'Cause mommy can rap...\n(Rachel tries to rap and makes weird movements with her arms in the\nprocess.) My name is mommy and I'm here to say / that all the babies are...\nOh, I can't rap... Allright sweetheart... This is only because I love you so\nmuch, and I know that you're not gonna tell anybody... (Rachel's face is\ntelling \"Oh what am I doing? The things I have to go through... and she\nstarts to rap) I like... big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers\ncan't deny... / when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round\nthing in your face... (Emma starts to laugh) Yes! Yes! Yes! YES! Oohhhhh!\nOh! (Rachel now really gets into it, and her insecure movements start\ngetting better) I like big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers\ncan't deny... Oh Emma you're laughing! Oh you are, you really do like big\nbutts, don't you. Oh you beautiful little weirdo... (Rachel picks up Emma\nand Ross now enters)",
        "Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing. It was\namazing. It was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that...",
        "Oh! You know, I just... couple of things I tried ... I just sang a\nlittle doo... Itsy Bitsy Spider...",
        "Nothing else worked. That girl is all about the ass...",
        "So fellas",
        "fellas",
        "has your girlfriend got the butt?",
        "So shake it! (Rachel slaps Ross's butt on the beat)",
        "Shake it! (Phoebe, Mike, Chandler, Monica and Joey step in)",
        "Shake that nasty butt...",
        "One more time from the top... I like big butts and I cannot lie, you\nother br... (She also turns and sees the gang)",
        "So I don't go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance to know her.",
        "That's great, great. So do you have any questions for us?",
        "Allright. Well thank you so much for coming... (they're standing up and make their way to the door)",
        "Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.",
        "Okidoki! (and she slams the door in the nanny's face while Ross crumples up the application form) Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.",
        "(indignant) What, the blonde with no bra?",
        "Okay... (Ross opens the door.)",
        "Sandy, that's exactly what it is...",
        "Ross!",
        "Oh!",
        "Oh, that's pretty.",
        "Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.",
        "Oh, that would be great! (Sandy leaves for Emma's room) I love him, I love him, I love him...",
        "So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out.",
        "Why?",
        "(she's got that \"yeah, try to say it\" look on her face) Yes?",
        "(whispering and begging) Please? (Ross makes a \"whatever\" gesture) YES! Sandy you're hired.",
        "Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here.",
        "(in a tearful voice) Oh... Oh boy... (she turns around and sees Ross) Hi...",
        "Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancée and it was just sooo beautiful.",
        "I can't... I can't hear it again.",
        "Yeah! (to Sandy) Excuse me... (She walks to the kitchen with Ross and sighs)",
        "Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, that's all.",
        "What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?",
        "Sandy made Madeleines.",
        "Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle.",
        "Okay, what? What is too sensitive? (There's music coming from the living room. Ross opens the door to the living room and he and Rachel see Sandy play a song for Emma on his recorder. Rachel is moved by this, but Ross only sees his point proven again, and walks back into the kitchen, angrily. The door he was holding, swings back and hits Rachel.)",
        "That was kind of rude!",
        "You know, he was just doing his job...",
        "Oh, come on Ross...",
        "(sighs) Oh... That's true.",
        "Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're gonna have to do it. (Ross walks to the living room determined to fire Sandy)",
        "I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo. (Ross walks to the couch where Sandy sits)",
        "(from behind the bedroom door) YOU! You feel!",
        "(from bedroom) Oh, damn you Geller!",
        "(from the bedroom) Huh ha ha!",
        "Who is it?",
        "Hide my rings.",
        "Oh. <opens door preparing herself and then happily says>\nAmy! Happy Thanksgiving.",
        "Um... hi.",
        "Aw.",
        "I haven't seen you in like.. a year.",
        "Oh well yeah me too. Um.. I had a baby.",
        "Oh.. yeah? Well unless you pushed a desk out of your v*g1n*, <shakes head no> not the same thing.",
        "mh hmm..",
        "Uh.... its Emma.",
        "Oh Amy, you remember Ross.",
        "Amy! <pause> Yes I do.. I really do. <grabs Ross' hand for support>",
        "Yeah, no. Ross has a PhD.",
        "God she is unbelievable.",
        "Oh sure Ross, yeah. If I have a heart attack in a restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush.",
        "What? What happened?",
        "Oh Amy, don't cry Amy.  Um.. Ross, could I talk to you in private?",
        "Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.",
        "Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has no where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's Emma's aunt. And I would like them to bond.",
        "Ross, you know what? She may need one..We're just going to have to make our peace with that!",
        "Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy.  This is Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon.",
        "Oh we just put her down for a nap.",
        "Why does she keep making that noise?",
        "Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um, if something were to happen to Ross or to myself <Ross and Rachel knock on wood> um you wouldn't get the baby.",
        "See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler. We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby.",
        "Monica is Ross' sister.",
        "Hey. Amy. You've got to stop doing that.",
        "Well actually...",
        "Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just.. you're more the fun parent.",
        "Ucch.  <pauses> Uchh <louder this time> In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not talking to you.",
        "UCHH! <much louder and longer then Amy's>",
        "Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when I died and didn't give you my baby?",
        "What? What carrer?",
        "Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear.",
        "Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didn't even come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby.",
        "I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. <gets up and walks into the kitchen> And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving Emily to you.",
        "uh huh.",
        "Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You, your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people's feelings?",
        "Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!",
        "I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here today.",
        "ah ha ha. ah ha ha. <evil meancing laughter> It's forty five.",
        "You take that back.",
        "Take it back!",
        "Heey man, I work out.",
        "I do pilates.",
        "Bring it on!",
        "Did you just push me?",
        "Alright. Thats it! <Pushes Amy back>",
        "Ew! Gross.",
        "Mon, I'm so sorry.",
        "Are you okay Mon?",
        "Look Amy, it got a little of control..Um.. and I'm sorry. You're my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you..",
        "Uh. No.. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren discount.",
        "She needs changing.",
        "I hope the ends of these sentences are good!",
        "Ahh. [Looks down] Well, thank you! Ha-ha! [Ross continues to stare at Rachel] Okay – stop looking at me like that. The last time that happened [pointing towards Ross’s crotch] that happened [pointing at Emma]",
        "Yeah! Phoebe and I are gonna have so much fun! Thank you for watching the baby, by the way.",
        "Phoebe’s Mike?",
        "I didn’t know that you guys hung out.",
        "Awww. That’s so cute! Ross and Mike’s first date! [Beat] Is that going to be awkward? What are you guys gonna talk about?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Hi!",
        "Okay, So now I think Emma is properly down for the night but if you need anything Ross…[pointing finger into his chest]",
        "Okay. You too. And I hope you score.",
        "Bye [to Mike]",
        "Oh, god. It seems like forever ago.",
        "Well, um, I don’t know. I mean, for a long time, nothing. You know, actually, right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a little thing.",
        "Well, um, first he told me that he liked how I looked, and then, erm, we had a little, erm, eye contact.",
        "Uh huh.",
        "No, wait, don’t do that! It’s gonna make them think that they can come over here!",
        "We’re not here to meet guys. You have a boyfriend. I have a…baby and a Ross.",
        "Oh my god! I can’t believe you live in that building! My grandmother lives in that building, Ida Green? No sense of personal space? Kinda smells of chicken? Looks like a potato?!?",
        "Yeah! That’s my muppy!",
        "Oh, it’s complicated. I don’t actually have a boyfriend, but, erm…",
        "I’m sorry, no.",
        "Oh, sure!",
        "Great. [Gives thumbs up]",
        "I don’t know. He was cute and he liked me. It was an impulse.",
        "No, no, ‘cos I know exactly how the conversation is going to go. “Hey Ross”, “You know, I think that we had a moment before” [As Ross] “Yeah, um, me too” [As herself] “Well, but I’m not sure I really wanna do anything about it!” [As Ross] “Yeah, um, me, um, neither.” [As herself] “Ross, should we just continue to live together and not really tell each other how we’re really feeling?” [As Ross] “Yeah, that works for me, um, um.”",
        "Hey!",
        "The point is: maybe I should stop waiting around, waiting for moments with Ross. I should just move on with my life.",
        "Dunno, do I have to decide right now?",
        "Oh my god! Ross!! Ross is gonna pick up the phone! Ah, I have to get my number back! Oh my god! He’s gone!",
        "Oh, give me. [Rachel takes the phone of Phoebe] Hi, Mike! Hi, listen, I know this is a lot to ask, but you know what. If you do this, ah, Phoebe will do anything you want. Seriously, I’m talking dirty stuff.",
        "So, what did you guys do?",
        "Bye!",
        "Have fun, Pheebs! See ya guys. [Phoebe and Mike leave]",
        "Oh shoot, I forgot to pay Phoebe for the drinks! [Goes outside into the hallway] Wait, wait. So, did he call? Did that guy call?",
        "Oh, around 8:30?",
        "Then again at 9?",
        "Yeah…",
        "Ahhh.",
        "Oh, it’s so much fun. It’s so good to be out.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Yeah, I can't *wait* to go back to work.",
        "Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back\ncloset.",
        "We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.",
        "Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and\nthen we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?",
        "Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for\nChristmas?",
        "Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a\ngreat present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little\npresents? And you've just gotten her one great present?\nI mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you\ndo that to her Chandler? Why? Why?",
        "That's right!",
        "Oh, it's a Macy's bag!",
        "Oh.",
        "(Reading from a tag that's attached to the shoe) \"Dear losers,\ndo you really think I'd hide presents under the couch?\nP.S.: Chandler, I knew they'd break you.\"",
        "Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.",
        "(interrupting him) Oh Chandler, stop talking!",
        "(opens her present from Ross; it's a dark-red scarf) Oohh, I\nlove it!",
        "Well, not (the|this) second!",
        "Oh wow, it's so beautiful...",
        "What do you really want to do?",
        "Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this.",
        "Well, because if one more person says \"what a cute little boy\" I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna!",
        "That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl.",
        "I'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff . (To the guy behind her desk) Who the hell are you!?",
        "I'm the hell person whose office this is!",
        "Excuse me?",
        "Wait a minute! What do you mean, you're taking over my job?",
        "A vacation? My idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.",
        "Alright! Don't get too comfortable there, because I'm back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was. I can't say that I care too much for the way\nyou've rearranged my office.",
        "Excuse me?",
        "Can you please, please take care of it for me?",
        "Let me just get this straight! So I go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?",
        "That's right. You're very cheeky for a temp.",
        "Oh yeah, what department was that? The Jerk department?",
        "Did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue?",
        "Oh, hi Mr. Zelner.",
        "That's great. So now, Super Gavin, when I come back where are you planning on flying off to?",
        "(To herself) Oh, wow. Super ass-kissing power.",
        "Today.",
        "No, I said today! See, for a superhero, not so much with the listening.",
        "Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me.",
        "Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out.",
        "I know. You know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today?",
        "Come on, I don't know what else to do.",
        "Ross?",
        "You're pretty.",
        "Alright. Now that I'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to?",
        "Hey, they were popular when I left!",
        "Well, I should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed?",
        "Oh, no no no no. I see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. Okay, I've had it for five years, and I know how it works, so why don't you just",
        "(Sits down in her chair) Oh god. You've totally messed with the back support of my chair. How do you fix this?",
        "Fine, I will. (Pushes that button thing on the chair that makes it \"collapse\") Alright, fill me in!",
        "Yes. Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation. I actually made a few changes, but I think I'm caught up on everything. So ask me\nanything!",
        "Except that! (Mr. Zelner enters) Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon.",
        "What? I can't do that! I have the baby, and Ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour.",
        "Well, there you go. You win, you win. You get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, no one will ever remember that I worked here, and then Ralph will buy\nhis helicopter, and Super Gavin will just fly right along side of him!",
        "No, I can't, I have a baby.",
        "Why would you do that?",
        "That's really nice.",
        "Then you're not gonna like what's coming. (Starts crying) I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you.",
        "Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me.",
        "Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside.",
        "OK, thank you.",
        "Oh, wow, Molly is just great!",
        "What? You really think she's hot?",
        "And Joey?",
        "Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?",
        "Thank you! (goes to get coffee)",
        "So hot I cried myself to sleep last night. (Joey and Chandler clap their hands)",
        "Hello.",
        "Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology.",
        "Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious ...",
        "No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you.",
        "Hello. (to Gavin) But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, I am just really really happy ... (sees Gavin staring at Heather) I'm sorry, obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait 'till it's finished.",
        "I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!",
        "Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.",
        "Oh yeah, I'm jealous. \"Oh Gavin, please, please look at my ass\". (Gavin starts looking) Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your subordinate.",
        "That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship.",
        "It was ... (can't remember) oh my god. He didn't have a last name. It was just \"Tag\". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses.",
        "Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name was Morgan! Huh!",
        "Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?",
        "(to Joey) Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if you didn't go after her.",
        "Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away.",
        "Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone! (takes the phone) Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you? Uh huh ... ok then ... I'll pass you back to your son (gives phone to Gavin)",
        "Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.",
        "If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?",
        "Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact, from now on, I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to you, you \"momma's boy\", starting right now.",
        "Hi!",
        "Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin Mitchelle.",
        "Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his mother.",
        "Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!",
        "I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?",
        "Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!",
        "Shh!",
        "(to Monica) I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the last person I want to see.",
        "God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me.",
        "What?",
        "Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over.",
        "Oh, ok, thank you. (Molly leaves) (to Monica) Do you see what all the guys see in her?",
        "Yeah, sure!",
        "Oh, give me! (opens the box happily, then gets freaked and throws away the box, she and Mon jump up the sofa)",
        "Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?",
        "Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?",
        "whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?",
        "Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?",
        "Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.",
        "Mmm hmm.",
        "No.",
        "Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at (looks at his watch) ... 9:30?? God! Oh, this party was lame ...",
        "Oh, you bought me a present! Why?",
        "Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card (opens the card). \"From Gavin\"",
        "(opens the present, it's a green scarf) Awww, awww, it's beautiful.",
        "See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such a hard time?",
        "Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.",
        "You do?",
        "See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you ... (he kisses her) and you do that ... (they kiss again)",
        "Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something really stupid.",
        "No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.",
        "Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and...",
        "You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf...",
        "You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf!",
        "I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don't",
        "Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...",
        "Who is it?",
        "Why?",
        "Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little bit! Hello Gavin",
        "I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick",
        "Oh no no no",
        "So did I",
        "It's just a cold",
        "What? What's the matter?",
        "Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be funny.",
        "Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about Ross really, really.",
        "I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!",
        "Oh! Molly! You're not Ross.",
        "Right, right, yes!",
        "What?",
        "No! That's OK! That's OK! That's OK! No no no no! This is my business associate Gavin. He's just being silly.",
        "OK.",
        "I thought it was Ross.",
        "There isn't. There is totally isn't.",
        "All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were here, which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not in",
        "Yes",
        "People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin",
        "So seriously...rodeo clown?",
        "Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I’ve been looking for you everywhere!",
        "Listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o’ clock. So I was hoping you and I could have a",
        "Who?",
        "You’ve being seeing someone?",
        "Hi, and I am also Emma’s mother.",
        "Wow. She does that a lot!",
        "What, what, wait a minute! You haven’t even told her you were a doctor, yet? How long have you known her, like",
        "Ok, Ross, what’s going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?",
        "How do you know about that?",
        "Oh, that’s what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me?",
        "Score.",
        "Oh God, I can’t believe you’re making such a big deal about this. It was one kiss, one guy, one time!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "What? Who?",
        "Whoa, how do you know about that?",
        "Why didn’t I get that message?",
        "From the guy in the bar, why didn’t I get that message?",
        "Ross?",
        "Why?",
        "Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to decide what messages I should or should not get?",
        "Yes.",
        "Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you",
        "Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What’s wrong with us? You know when people hear about our situation they",
        "And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know,",
        "Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?",
        "Thank you.",
        "Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.",
        "Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and Emma.",
        "Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep, so...",
        "Bye!",
        "Hey!",
        "You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?",
        "I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.",
        "Well, Phoebe set me up on a date. ",
        "Why? What's the big deal?",
        "What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.",
        "So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?",
        "Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!",
        "Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken.",
        "Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you.",
        "What?",
        "Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. That's impressive.",
        "Really? What's that like?",
        "Really? ",
        "Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!",
        "This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?",
        "I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!",
        "He's not stoned.",
        "Yeah, four times.",
        "No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.",
        "Don't touch my coat!",
        "Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?",
        "Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!",
        "No.",
        "What? What do you mean, \"there you are\"? Where was she?",
        "Well, uh...",
        "Really, really not.",
        "All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve.",
        "I just had a rough night.",
        "Eww!",
        "Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but...",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh.",
        "Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?",
        "Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up.",
        "Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.",
        "Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show.",
        "(entering) Joey! You never gonna believe it: she called. ",
        "(enthusiastic) You got it!",
        "Your agent called. You got that audition.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it…",
        "(disbelieving) You saw that?",
        "Oh, yeah. Oh, I loved him in those cell phone commercials. ",
        "Oh, anything yet?",
        "Joey, that was formula.",
        "Okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph. ",
        "I don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but I think a canelope might hurt less.",
        "Woow!I haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog!",
        "(excited) Are you serious?",
        "Hey, that was an honest mistake!",
        "Yeah, that was an awesome day!",
        "Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?",
        "Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so gorgeous!",
        "Oh, in my head he's done some pretty \"not-gay-stuff\"!",
        "Ok, not that you need it but good...GOD!Is that Chase Lassiter?He's straight, right?",
        "Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.I'm sorry, good luck! (they hug)",
        "(watching a television where the scene is shown, startled) OH!",
        "SSSHHHHTTT!!He's asking her a question!!",
        "NO! (pause) Or, cut!You know, that's your call!",
        "Hi!",
        "Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking all day about that scene you did, I mean, you were amazing!",
        "God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!",
        "Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.",
        "Oh screw her, that part is mine!",
        "Okay. (pause).(acting) Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.",
        "(pause) Kiss me.",
        "Kiss me.",
        "No, I'm saying...",
        "just... don't talk... (she kisses him)",
        "(waking up) Ehhh, aw! (pause). Well, that's new!",
        "Can I ask you a question?",
        "Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?",
        "Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.",
        "Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.",
        "I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.",
        "Olivia.",
        "So do you think that my dream means anything?",
        "Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...",
        "You took the same class twice.",
        "Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...",
        "Ok, we're still on that.",
        "Hey!",
        "Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?",
        "(looks puzzled) How...how...?",
        "uh-huh",
        "(to herself) Wow...definitely just Drake...",
        "What...how is it going with Drake?",
        "What...that scene I saw was so good!",
        "Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?",
        "So?",
        "Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?",
        "Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?",
        "(shakes her head) Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.",
        "(looks touched) Joey, you never..you never talked about that before...",
        "Hi you guys!",
        "Oh er... well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that this place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment.",
        "No. I was just going to do this myself. (Joey makes a sarcastic laugh.)",
        "Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this?",
        "Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?",
        "Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!",
        "There is a hardware store right down the street?",
        "This is easy...Can't do this! (Moves away...and finds her sweater sleeve stuck to the drawer) Oh! Wow! Seriously I can't do this. (Fiddles more)",
        "Hi!",
        "Yeah, I don't know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks.",
        "Oh thank you so much. (Picks up the guy's spirit level) Oh oh wait! You forgot your erm...Your game. (hands it to him)",
        "Don't look at me I never get his jokes.",
        "Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.",
        "I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?",
        "No you really think that's what it is?",
        "Yeah! If you don't I will! Of course your body's gonna change. Your breasts are gonna get bigger, your ass is gonna get bigger, you're gonna lose bladder control. (she starts sobbing) God! It's just such a magical time!",
        "Argh. fascist",
        "Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!",
        "Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!?",
        "Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?",
        "Yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy. (She suddenly lets go) I mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys.",
        "I'm so sorry Pheebs.",
        "Oh! So you're driving up to Connecticut?",
        "Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split it!",
        "Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker.",
        "Well when I talk to her I almost feel like she understands what I'm saying.",
        "Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were there!",
        "She dropped off a casserole?",
        "(to Monica)What's going on?",
        "Well, there's two spots left right?",
        "Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.",
        "You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?",
        "Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel? You know, we're gonna be all like \"oh everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the cape\" and you're gonna be all like \"oh, I can't guys, I'll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai\"",
        "I don't really care about the Knicks.",
        "(touched) You would do that? I never get picked!",
        "I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.",
        "Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.",
        "Ooh, I have another idea!",
        "Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!",
        "Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your \"special\" tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?",
        "Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?",
        "All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us!",
        "(surprised) OH! Alright, you know what? That's it! I want my share of the tickets (picks up the bowl)!",
        "Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them up! (she tries to snatch the bowl from Joey's hands but she can't, so she pinches his nipple and she manages to take it)",
        "Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.",
        "Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work.",
        "No, she was just much better at job than me!",
        "(To Ross) You know what? We should call my mum's house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down.",
        "Hi mum, put her back on!",
        "(on the phone) Mum, please!I know you love your new lips, but I can barely understand you! Would you, please, just let me say goodnight to my daughter?",
        "(she goes towards the others and she's very excited) Guys, you're not gonna believe this! I was just saying goodnight to Emma and she said her first words!!",
        "She said \"gleba\"!! (she celebrates)",
        "(to Ross) Isn't that amazing?",
        "Why-why aren't you more excited?",
        "Oh, but of course it is!",
        "I don't know all the words.",
        "Ok... \"Emma just said gleba\"!",
        "Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up (she goes and picks up the dictionary).",
        "(searching the dictionary) Alright, okay, okay, gleba, gleba... (excited) Gleba! Ha! Here it is: the fleshy, spore-bearing inner mass of a certain fungi.",
        "You know what? There is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win.",
        "What?",
        "So Pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?",
        "Me too.",
        "Hey! How was basketball?",
        "Oh, no! Who did that?",
        "She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it?",
        "Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!",
        "All right... Oh, Emma loves him!",
        "(threatening Joey with a scrunchy): Step away from the crib, I have a weapon!",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom.",
        "Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.",
        "Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.",
        "Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail...",
        "Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?",
        "Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.",
        "Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.",
        "Joey, come on!",
        "I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?",
        "Original.",
        "Then what's that big lump under your covers?",
        "That's not Monica!",
        "(to herself) Oh God.",
        "(yelling) Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much (Joey covers Hugsy's ears) Oh don't cover its ears! (stops yelling) It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!",
        "Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.",
        "Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever (She leaves the room).",
        "Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up. (Turns to face Emma in the the playpen) Look Emma, look who's baaack!",
        "Are you gonna... you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?",
        "I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls at the party, GOD!",
        "(worried) Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know... and I... want him to hook up with lots of women! (pause) I just... All I'm saying is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.",
        "All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean...",
        "Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?",
        "(after a pause) Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!",
        "Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.",
        "Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting...",
        "Well, I would like to have the option!!",
        "Oh!",
        "Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!",
        "I don't care about any of that!!",
        "Oh!",
        "Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!",
        "I promise.",
        "But I am going hunting!!",
        "(to the receptionist) Hi there!",
        "Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and here is my gift certificate.",
        "And... taped back together.",
        "Ok",
        "(imitating the receptionist's tone) through the glass doors.",
        "Alright-y then.",
        "Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person. (Puts her head in the hole and Phoebe enters)",
        "Oh... what an interesting name.",
        "You know I... (lifts her head and tries to look in Phoebe's direction)",
        "(Sees Phoebe's slippers through the hole) Wow... I really love your... (startled as she realizes those are Phoebe's slippers)",
        "No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea... (pause) Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?",
        "Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!",
        "Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have a friend who is a masseuse.",
        "Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though... (Phoebe looks devastated)",
        "I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar...",
        "(now lifts her head) Phoebe!!",
        "For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!",
        "How could you not tell me you worked here?",
        "Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!",
        "Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?",
        "Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles and I so admire that! I don't have any!",
        "Good for you Pheebs!",
        "(gets up from the sofa and moves to the kitchen but Joey blocks her way) Oh, sorry... Oops, sorry.",
        "Ooh... oooh... (pause) (Rachel is all bah-jiggity about Joey) oh, ah... (pause) (to Monica) Can I ask you a question?",
        "Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?",
        "No reason.",
        "Yeah",
        "(with high pitched voice) Nobody, forget it!",
        "(giggling and whispering) Maybe.",
        "(whispering) Why? (Monica gesticulates mumbling something that starts with \"because\") Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.",
        "Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!",
        "Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.",
        "I know them from work.",
        "No, one of them...",
        "I don't know, what were the names I just said?",
        "All right, all right, you're right, I won't do anything with Joey, I just thought that we (Joey enters the hall) Ok so that would be two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and one red onion? (Joey enters his apartment)",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight.",
        "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... (she plays the answering machine)",
        "(angry) You are having a party tonight??",
        "And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were gonna get away with that?",
        "You do that every year??",
        "Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??",
        "And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?",
        "OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?",
        "Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?",
        "Well, then so you just invite me...!",
        "Oh, Joey, come on! Please, please! Let me come, I will behave, I promise! I will behave! Please, please, please...",
        "(yelling and jumping like a child) OH, a soap opera roof party!! I'm going to a soap opera roof party!! Oh my God, oh my God!! (realizing how she's behaving) And it's out of my system!",
        "(she enters wearing a bath-robe) Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play.",
        "I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!!",
        "... Ok, who is this?",
        "Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!",
        "Sure! (Monica takes her apart) Oh...",
        "What? Yes, I am!",
        "When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better! (she closes her robe)",
        "Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!",
        "Ok! (whispering) Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!",
        "And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!!",
        "Ok professor or detective?",
        "Yeah, and he does it every year! That's why he's sending you to that play! That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!",
        "Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number.",
        "Nice to meet you.",
        "Ok",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!",
        "I always loved that!!",
        "Come on! I think this is funny! (Ross leaves)",
        "(drunken voice) I think I am.",
        "(picking up the tissues) Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?",
        "Joey, you're so sweet.",
        "Who (looks around)?",
        "(surprised) What? (with a nervous smile) Really?",
        "Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it! (they high-five)",
        "Oh, Very funny... Joey.",
        "(to Monica) Hey!",
        "I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.",
        "Please, what about you and Chandler?",
        "Well hello (points to herself)!",
        "I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!",
        "(pause) I'm gonna do it.",
        "No.",
        "(speaking to herself and reading Cosmopolitan) Oh, lucky me! Coffee and a live s*x show!",
        "Oh... Oh, I'm sorry! I'm not... I was just-I was just reading to Emma.",
        "Yeah, yeah... It's... \"climax your way to better skin\".",
        "(hiding herself behind the magazine and whispering) Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!",
        "Yeah...",
        "Oh, well...",
        "Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!",
        "Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!",
        "And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!",
        "Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.",
        "That's not what we're gonna do!",
        "Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?",
        "Not gonna find any clothes in there!",
        "Hi.",
        "Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?",
        "I'm there!",
        "Bye, see ya. (she goes)",
        "Pheebs, that's for men!",
        "On Melanie Griffith in \"Working girl\". I think what you want is over here.",
        "Really?",
        "Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them.",
        "Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!",
        "Sure!",
        "You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.",
        "She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!",
        "I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!",
        "Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom...",
        "Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.",
        "It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!",
        "(annoyed) Oh, I get it!",
        "I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.",
        "So can we keep this between us?",
        "Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!",
        "Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!",
        "Ok, great!",
        "Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!",
        "(sticks her head out too) Well, get back in there and talk!",
        "(comes out again) What!?",
        "Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!",
        "Oh! What are we gonna do?",
        "Oh my God!",
        "(yelling at the stranger) Alright! Enough out of you!",
        "Alright! Let's just do it. Let's just go over there and see if she heard.",
        "Ok. (Phoebe starts to walk in the opposite direction though. Rachel sees and follows her) Wha...? where? Where are you going?",
        "(to Charlie) Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been?",
        "(pretends to be stunned) Oh! Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? Well, that's so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. God it's just such a small world!",
        "Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain.",
        "(after a pause) Yeah.",
        "Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho!",
        "Yeah...",
        "(Looks ashamed) I try...",
        "No, that's David.",
        "(disapprovingly) Tip of the iceberg.",
        "(through wall) Ooh... I love Barbados!",
        "I know, I'm her!",
        "ooh...",
        "Hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?",
        "What? Ross and Charlie? (Joey nods) Wow! She's really making her way through the group, huh? Ah, who am I to talk?",
        "Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant. (Joey like stands at attention with his chest forward and his hands on his sides, looking up at the ceiling with his lips pouted.) That's not nonchalant!",
        "Oh... okay, just hide!",
        "Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!",
        "There's no room under the bed. (looks around because she can't find Joey anymore)",
        "Yeah... (still looking to see where Joey went, and opens the door)",
        "Hi...",
        "...I really don't... (looks around again)",
        "Yeah, sure... (looks outside into the corridor if Joey is there)",
        "(clearly not listening and still trying to find out where Joey went) Uh-huh... right... yeah...",
        "(still searching) Oh, I know... I know it's been really hard for you.",
        "(now looking up at the ceiling) That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say.",
        "You would think!",
        "Joey!",
        "(still can't find him) How are you doing this?",
        "How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time?",
        "Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade!",
        "All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...",
        "Sure...",
        "Get out!",
        "Are they right?",
        "Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight.",
        "(Joey walks to the door) Although...",
        "I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like... six years...",
        "Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.",
        "No...",
        "Yeah...",
        "Forgotten.",
        "Nothing...",
        "Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here, come here...",
        "Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out of my head...",
        "Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.",
        "Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner.",
        "Still nervous?",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah! (mouths \"Good luck\" to Joey and gets up from her seat)",
        "So hi!",
        "So you eh, you talked to Joey?",
        "Oh! That's great!",
        "Oh, so everything's okay?",
        "Ah... Well, obviously I think so too.",
        "Really? Excited?",
        "Excuse me! (and she walks back to Joey, who is still looking very impressed about what Ross said to him. Rachel looks at him and hits him.) You didn't tell him, did you?",
        "Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.",
        "That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.",
        "Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.",
        "Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal.",
        "What? What is it?",
        "Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.",
        "Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?",
        "Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...",
        "Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.",
        "Hi!",
        "Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.",
        "Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.",
        "Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't...",
        "No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?",
        "Goo--ood night!",
        "Seriously, good night!",
        "Okay.",
        "Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?",
        "Hey! Hey what's going on?",
        "Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!",
        "Ooh! You guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. That's all, I just wish I could (looks at Joey who is at the check in desk) share that with a guy.",
        "Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler.",
        "(looking out the window) What's with the rain, Geller? I mean, when I signed up for Dino Week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season.",
        "It's not the time Charlie.",
        "You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work.",
        "Well, I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else's computer.",
        "Ugh.",
        "Well, I've brought some books. We could read.",
        "We can't. We're not pharmacists!",
        "(picking up another random badge) Kate Miller?",
        "And... that's the most s*x I'm gonna have this weekend.",
        "Thank you. (they walk away)",
        "I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.",
        "Well, let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts...",
        "(takes a sip from her drink, embarassed) No.",
        "No, I'm not blushing, I'm sunburnt! From, you know, the rain.",
        "No.",
        "Joey! (she walks away; Joey goes after her teasing and tickling her)",
        "Joey, come on! It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen.",
        "Oh! (pause) Ok. Ok, you really wanna know who it is?",
        "Do ya?",
        "Later! La...",
        "Ok. See you, bye.",
        "Ok, good night!",
        "(walking in hurriedly) Open your drapes! Open your drapes!",
        "Nooo!",
        "Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous!",
        "Homo.",
        "All right! Well, uh... (to Monica) we're gonna hit the beach?",
        "(to Ross, in a flattering tone) It was really... great!",
        "Oh!",
        "Oh! Weather bitch! (turns the TV off)",
        "It's open! (Joey walks in) Hi, Joe!",
        "(worried) What, is everything ok?",
        "Nooooo, why?",
        "(laughing) Oh, that's crazy!",
        "... yeah, it's true.",
        "(pretending to be offended) What, hey!",
        "W-What are you, what are you talking about?",
        "Ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl...",
        "Yeah, I'm not talking about her...",
        "You know? Forget it!",
        "No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know who I'm talking about! So!",
        "Yeah, sure!",
        "(nearly whispering) Ok, let's not make a big thing about this!",
        "Not working with me, Joe! Here's the thing: lately I have been having thoughts (pauses) musings, if you will!",
        "Only like a month!",
        "What the... DIAL IT DOWN! (Joey goes to sit on the bed) Listen, ok, and maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do, I have, I've been thinking about... you know, us! (looks at Joey, who's totally distraught) Ok, dial it up a little!",
        "Shoot!",
        "I don't know, I'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... I mean, aren't you just a... little curious... (insinuating) what that would be like?...",
        "(puzzled) Who...?",
        "Oh yes, of course, I remember him!",
        "Yeah, he did! (smiling) Oh, see, this is what I'm talking about!",
        "But can it... just... happen a little bit?",
        "But why, why not?",
        "But that wasn't gonna stop you before!",
        "(regretful) I'm sorry, too! (they look at each other sadly, then she recollects, and puts her hands over her eyes) OH GOD! I shouldn't have said anything!",
        "It's not a big deal!",
        "It's so not a big deal!",
        "Ok!",
        "Ok, I...",
        "AAAHHHH!",
        "What?",
        "Joey’s apartment. Joey and Rachel enter the room]\nRachel: Thanks for dinner.",
        "So.",
        "I say ‘cheesy line’, but ok.",
        "I am sorry, I don’t know, I am sorry, I don’t know why I did that!",
        "Okay",
        "Ok, so sorry.",
        "I am sorry! Again... I don't know, I don’t know what happened, I must be nervous!",
        "Ok, ok, ok. I promise, I promise, I promise, I won’t do it again. I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great.",
        "Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it’s just a little weird, it’s you, and it’s me, it's just gonna take some getting used to.",
        "Ok, let’s work from the top down! (Joey nods, but then puzzled because he does not get it) Just work the bra, Joe!",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh!",
        "Ow!",
        "Well this is romantic!",
        "It’s a standard issue bra clasp!",
        "Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey, but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take off my bra?",
        "(laughing) oooh! Oh oh!",
        "oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?",
        "Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and I kept slapping it away!",
        "Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out too! He couldn't even undo my bra!",
        "I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.",
        "(looking thoughtful) Ok, that's true. That's true, we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna power through!",
        "(To Joey) No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through (At which point she grabs his hand and pulls him back to their apartment).",
        "Hey! Got champagne?",
        "Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket, the phone is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through (Starts to remove her bra from under her clothes)...",
        "Ok (starts to light some candles) Sexy, sexy, very sexy, sexy. (Claps her hands and jumps at Joey, clearly very excited) Alright! Lets do it!",
        "Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this! (She pulls him towards her and throws him onto the barcalounger) Ok. Aha! You like that huh?",
        "You like that? (She climbs on the barcalounger seductively, putting her knees next to Joey's hips.) Let's take this into high gear (She pulls the barcalounger lever and seat reclines. She puts one of her knees between his legs and begins to kiss his neck.)",
        "Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!",
        "What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?",
        "What is the matter with us?",
        "No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?",
        "Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?",
        "No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...",
        "Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.",
        "Right, totally.",
        "Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have s*x.",
        "I know.",
        "Hmmm... Me too...",
        "I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?",
        "Aah... I bet you're right.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.",
        "Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!",
        "We're having a party.",
        "No, that day... that won't be her real birthday!",
        "Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?",
        "And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!",
        "You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all.",
        "Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18.",
        "Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.",
        "I said it's still nap time.",
        "Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?",
        "Oh, she's still napping",
        "Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.",
        "No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.",
        "Oh! Emma might like what?",
        "What did you get her?",
        "Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?",
        "(to everybody) All right, let’s get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.",
        "So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?",
        "Oh, ok, which one?",
        "(crying) Wow! That was amazing!",
        "Oh, Phoebe, I’m sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.",
        "Is that it?",
        "Ross, um, don’t forget to get a shot of Emma’s cake. It’s in a box in the fridge.",
        "Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Corino’s.",
        "Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, they’ll copy it in icing!",
        "Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.",
        "Ross, what are you talking about? (she sees the cake) oh! Oh my God! They put my baby’s face on a pen1s!",
        "Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would have baked it myself!",
        "Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even want it in my home... (Turns towards the cake and sees Joey trying to take a piece and yells at him) Joey, don't touch it!!",
        "(speaking to the person on the phone again) Yes, yes. I still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!",
        "(into the phone) No, there isn't time to go to the bakery. We're just gonna come home... Everybody left? Alright, well just tell Emma we're gonna be there as soon as we can. (emotionally) Bye...",
        "OOH! God! Sorry!",
        "Emma's awake.",
        "I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.",
        "Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.",
        "(shakes her head) I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing \"Happy Birthday\". Then we would all go into... HEY GET OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!! (honks furiously, and Ross looks at her in disbelief and Rachel looks at him.) They have to learn!",
        "What?",
        "(she looks at the cake) Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?",
        "Well, I'm very impressed.",
        "I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys!",
        "What?",
        "Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!",
        "(angrily) NO, no science camp!",
        "Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!",
        "Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.",
        "Okay.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Okay. (they both look into the camera, and Ross waves.) Hi Emma. Well, your first birthday is over, and it was really...",
        "Hi!",
        "My God!",
        "Congratulations! Wow!!",
        "Mmh-mmh!",
        "Oh, Pheebs, baby, that's nice but, you know what, I think I'm ok. Why don't you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?",
        "(angrily) GIVE ME THE BOOK! (she takes it and start reading) Pablo Diaz, Brady Smith, huh, \"Guy-in-van\"?",
        "Oh!",
        "Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?",
        "Hi!",
        "I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in.",
        "Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.",
        "Who's Gladys?",
        "(sarcastic) Oh, and Monica gets to keep her? In her house? I am so jealous!",
        "Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already gave that to Monica, so...",
        "No, I couldn't let you do that.",
        "But I don't want you to.",
        "But I insist harder!",
        "(sarcastic) No, no, that's ok. You won fair and square. I'm so sad!\n[Scene: Chandler walks into Joey's apartment]",
        "Did you watch the tape?",
        "But you are a liar.",
        "Well, this is going well. (Chandler looks worried)",
        "(surprised by how ugly it is) Wow! (sarcastic) Oh, she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh so proudly? (looks around for a spot)",
        "Well, hey! How about right above the TV? (Points to the spot where her famous French poster is hanging). That way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!",
        "(jumps at the chance to make that happen) Oh! There's nothing above your bed!!",
        "O-oh my God!",
        "Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?",
        "Joey, we're not keeping this!",
        "Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't mind that she's haunted.",
        "Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive when you're asleep.",
        "She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. (in a spooky, slow voice) And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.",
        "Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at this game. (gives Gladys to Monica)",
        "Yes I can! (pushes her back again)",
        "She's yours!",
        "She's yours!",
        "She's mine!",
        "She's mine!",
        "I want Gladys!",
        "She's mine!",
        "She's mine!",
        "Excellent!",
        "Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not get old.",
        "Oh, don't be such a baby!",
        "You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her first cookie.",
        "I've never given her a cookie. Have you?",
        "Of course, I'd be honored!",
        "OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had s*x...",
        "Amy! Hi! Oh-oh-hoh! (they hug) Wow! You remember Joey?",
        "So now, what are you doing here?",
        "(Emma starts crying in the other room) Oh sorry, hold on. Let me just check on the baby!",
        "God!",
        "Oh, I know, isn't she?",
        "All right. What's your news, Amy?",
        "What? Oh my God! To who?",
        "A-And??",
        "No, what's he like?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Huh... wow, so he's gotta be...",
        "Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like...",
        "Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married somebody that I didn’t love. Do you remember Barry?",
        "Sometimes just nodding is ok. (pause) Uhm, so but anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever made. Honey, you deserve true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!",
        "Ok.",
        "Ok, let’s keep talking.",
        "Amy, hi!",
        "Oh, good for you!",
        "Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you!",
        "But Erin Brockovich had her own house.",
        "Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling ‘Myron, get off!’",
        "Joey, I can’t do that!",
        "Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she’s difficult, but I think it’s really good that she’s here.",
        "No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me.",
        "Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don’t think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn’t for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it’s gonna take patience, but that’s ok.",
        "Amy, that’s what I was supposed to wear today, that’s why I hung it on the door.",
        "Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.",
        "Well, what happened?",
        "Oh, that is so tacky.",
        "Phoebe, that’s huge!",
        "I think it could be kind of great!",
        "(Sarcastically) Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker? (claps her hands together, faking excitement)",
        "(Takes the phone) Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years ago!!",
        "(Into the phone) Hello? (announces to Amy) Oh, it's our nanny! (goes back to the phone conversation) Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye! (Hangs up) (To Ross) That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?",
        "Menstrual cramps.",
        "(To Monica, Chandler and Phoebe) Can any of you watch Emma?",
        "(To Ross) Great, shoot, what are we gonna do?",
        "(Thinks for a moment) Well, actually...",
        "Yeah.",
        "Why not?",
        "(Defends Amy) Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name!",
        "(Shocked) Wha... the next one?",
        "Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!",
        "Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows (points at her own to emphasize the word) shaped to do this alright? Do you understand how important that is in our world?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "(To Emma) Hey! Hi, how's my girl?",
        "(sounds excited) Yeah!",
        "(not excited anymore) You pierced her ears!?",
        "You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?",
        "Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.",
        "Ugh. (takes the hat and covers Emma's head and half her face with it)",
        "Nah, I don't really want her to see.",
        "Nothing.",
        "Oh, they're real!",
        "I know, I know, and you were right Ross. (To Amy) You are soo irresponsible I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!",
        "I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?",
        "Oh yeah? Since when?",
        "(looks at Ross and then at Amy again in disbelief) What?",
        "(shouting) Babies don't care if they're slim.",
        "Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!",
        "You put holes in my baby's ears!",
        "(gasps) I can't believe I ever even tried to help you. You are so beyond help.",
        "Excuse me?",
        "(yelling) Joey, where are those bags?",
        "(doesn't believe what she's hearing) Seriously?",
        "Hips or thighs?",
        "(gasps) Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.",
        "(embarrassed) Oh, I can give you that.",
        "Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're... you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are.",
        "Did you just say Emma?",
        "So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?",
        "That's shocking!",
        "We weren't doing anything!",
        "Shhh.",
        "No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.",
        "Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.",
        "We feel so terrible about this, Ross.",
        "Ross? (to Joey) Can we just close the door?",
        "Ross, say something. Anything.",
        "Yeah.",
        "No, no, no!",
        "Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts.",
        "No, but you know what I mean.",
        "Calm ourselves?",
        "Well, what would we be doing?",
        "Feel me up?",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh, you bet.",
        "Okay, well, we brought you some wine.",
        "Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.",
        "No awareness.",
        "Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.",
        "Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!",
        "Ooy.",
        "Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?",
        "Ross, you don't seem okay.",
        "Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me.",
        "You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.",
        "No, no, it's just that it's getting late...",
        "Yeah, that's probably a good idea.",
        "Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.",
        "(to Joey) Hey, who's Phoebe with?",
        "Do you think I'm someone else?",
        "Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh!",
        "Well, it's a little low... pick up a little... (Ross picks it up) a little bit more... (he picks it up again) a little bit more... (he takes it off) There you go! (pause) Now throw it away!",
        "Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.",
        "Hi",
        "what?",
        "Oh! Oh, no!",
        "Oh, yeah. Joey doesn’t share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...",
        "Oh no! Not me! Emma!",
        "Ah, this place is great!",
        "Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! (she picks up a blue sweater). I mean, this is just beautiful!",
        "Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!",
        "No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there’s other stuff. Here’s a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...",
        "Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I’m... I’m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.",
        "Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she’s gonna go nuts for you.",
        "(to Phoebe) Why do men keep talking to me like this?",
        "We got some really great stuff!",
        "Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me?",
        "(looking into one of her shopping bags) Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by\nmistake, and one of mine is missing.",
        "Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!",
        "Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?",
        "Oh my God, what!?",
        "Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.",
        "(upset) All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing incident... when I was little.",
        "Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair! (crying) And it was uneven for weeks!",
        "Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes.",
        "Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth!",
        "All right!",
        "Irrational, huh? All right, well, I’ll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!",
        "Ok, careful.",
        "Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!",
        "I know (she touches Emma’s head) but they’re just so beautiful! Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.",
        "Ok.",
        "Ok.",
        "Ok, careful, ok. (Emma giggles) Oh, she’s smiling! Oh my God, she does like it!",
        "Awe! (Emma laughs) Oh my God! Looks, she’s a little dare-devil! Oh, let me push, can I push?",
        "Ok. Oh God. (To Ross) Get the camera, it’s in the diaper bag.",
        "Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?",
        "Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it. That is\nthe last time Emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life.",
        "Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else gets\nhurt?",
        "(looks at him suspiciously) I know what this is all about... You've always been\njealous of my hair.",
        "Alright fine. I'll do it.",
        "If you hold a spider.",
        "IF you hold a spider.",
        "Ok... I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one.",
        "Ok... (and passes the spider to Ross who holds it in between his hands)",
        "(reluctantly) Ok... O-k...",
        "(more confident) Ok...",
        "whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!",
        "A-alright! I can do this.",
        "That's because he's on your neck.",
        "ROSS!",
        "Hi!",
        "I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!",
        "It's not? (whispering to Ross) When was she born?",
        "Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!",
        "Did you at least win the contest?",
        "Can't wait!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, let's see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?",
        "Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!",
        "Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!",
        "Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy...",
        "And a thousand dollars.",
        "...is something I'm very interested in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that (in a deep voice, mocking Ross) what's in the inside is important...",
        "Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?",
        "Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid.",
        "Oh Phoebe, listen. Well, I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. I've been watching this guy over there, I don't think he came with a kid!",
        "Phoebe, I think... It's just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!",
        "Oh, Phoebe! Come on! You know what, it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet. We gotta go, we got dinner!",
        "Phoebe, you have to calm down.",
        "Really?",
        "You heard them say that?",
        "All right, okay. Alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about!",
        "No, what?",
        "No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!",
        "Because I already did!",
        "No...",
        "What are you doing here!",
        "And I won!",
        "Yes! (spells it) Y-E-S. Yes!",
        "Yeah. That's me!",
        "She won a thousand dollars!",
        "Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap.",
        "Alright, Emma is napping... (then to Ross) what happened to your shirt?",
        "You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time. (When she finishes talking, a note is pushed from under Monica's and Chandler's door, into the hall. Ross picks it up and reads it out loud)",
        "Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad.",
        "Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. (they all agree) Ready? (they do the rock-paper-scissor thing with they hands and Rachel has paper, Phoebe and Ross both have rock, while Joey is doing a strange upward wiggling with his fingers. They all look a him confused).",
        "Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time.",
        "Alright, come on... (starts to knock on the door) Alright, you guys. We're so sorry we're late. Please let us in, so we can have dinner together.",
        "You guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're late. We're all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey. (A slice of turkey on a piece of aluminum foil is slid under door)",
        "(gasps) Oh, I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.",
        "Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS. (they all look appalled)",
        "Oh, I know... I still have my old key! (She goes in to get it and comes back with her keys) We can just unlock the door.",
        "You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together. (Goes to unlock the door)",
        "Oh!",
        "So, so sorry.",
        "So bad.",
        "Dessert?",
        "Congratulatioooons!",
        "Ewww, is that what that is?",
        "Yeah! I'll cook!",
        "Hey!",
        "I lent them to Ross.",
        "I'm so happy for you!",
        "To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.",
        "Really?",
        "My God, get a room!",
        "Oh God. What about you, Joe? What would you give up, s*x or food?",
        "No, you gotta pick one!",
        "You gotta see these latest pictures of Emma.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, no, no. That is a doll.",
        "Oh. Who is the blonde, she's pretty.",
        "He's not having an affair!",
        "No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!",
        "Oh, that doesn't mean anything.",
        "(whispering) \"Dude, Where's My Car?\"",
        "They're in a caaar...",
        "Geez!",
        "Oh, yeah, ok. Let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun.",
        "I’m telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!",
        "Oh, look at her, so happy!",
        "Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.",
        "Who's Nancy?",
        "Are you serious?",
        "What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!",
        "Yeah it is.",
        "Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but MAN this would be a nice place to live!",
        "(talking on the phone) C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!",
        "Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.",
        "You're fly is open, Geller!",
        "Ow, that had to hurt!",
        "No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.",
        "Oooohh that’s interesting.",
        "14?",
        "Space cowboy!",
        "Ow...Oh Gosh!",
        "Oh-oh-oh, he’s a transponce—transpondster!",
        "Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!",
        "That is not true. She did! She forced me!",
        "Well it stupid, unfair question!",
        "(running from the guy's apartment with Joey in tow) Hey, what's-what's going on?!",
        "Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.",
        "What?!",
        "Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.",
        "Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.",
        "Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.",
        "And a crappy New Year.",
        "You can't move. You just... you just can't.",
        "Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and... (nods towards Ross) maybe close your blinds at night.",
        "Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.",
        "Aah! Why? What are these for?",
        "Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful. (she got a scarf)",
        "Oh God, that's right. I blocked that out.",
        "Oh, d'you like it?",
        "What?",
        "Pheebs, I... there isn't gonna be any flying about! We actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that.",
        "Seriously Pheebs, it's not gonna be that kind of a party.",
        "Nooo! Phoebe, of course there is more! I mean, I'll just go and talk to Monica and get an ETA on the pee-pee's!",
        "Well, he's coming from Jersey, he said he would get here as fast as he could!",
        "(pretends to be shocked) Uh! The police!",
        "Yeah?",
        "All right, look, we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!",
        "No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book!",
        "This is so awesome! College guys are so cute!",
        "I know. But if some guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me tonight, I'm sooo gonna let them! (They spot Chandler)",
        "It... You can so totally tell.",
        "Well lets see. Maybe he knows where Ross is. (They walk towards Chandler) Hey, how's it going (tries to look as un-interested in him as possible - checking out her nails).",
        "Yeah, Rachel. And this (points to Monica) is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. (looks around the room as if searching for something more interesting to do).",
        "Bitchin'",
        "Oh.",
        "I am sooo drunk.",
        "(finishing the last of her drink) I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow.",
        "(sarcastic) Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now?",
        "(blushing) Oh, what a line. (walks towards the drinks table with her back towards Chandler and whispers \"Oh my God!\")",
        "Oh well, You know, I think it's kinda really important that I go somewhere where there's sun, so I'm sort of... (Chandler leans in an kisses her) (She pulls away) Hey!",
        "(She considers it for a second) Yeah okay. (She puts her hands around his neck and they start kissing again)",
        "No, wait. No there's gotta be something else that you can do. I mean, what skills do you have?",
        "So maybe something in an office.",
        "(to Phoebe) Really?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix.",
        "Uh... November?",
        "Hey Pheebs...",
        "Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.",
        "Well, this is really awkward (staring at the floor) Oh, and I can leave!",
        "(excited and clapping her hands in front of her face) Goody, what is it!",
        "What, what, what, no, I don't wanna do that.",
        "Happy wedding day!",
        "Ok-dokey, Joey, listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right? We're gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.",
        "What d'you want?",
        "Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!",
        "Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!",
        "Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!",
        "Hi",
        "Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.",
        "All right fine, I pick you.",
        "(not amused by his pun but forcing a smile anyway) Oh my...",
        "Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other.",
        "Who's there?",
        "Uh.",
        "You know what, I can't do this. I don't know which one of you guys to pick.",
        "(sarcastic) Wow, this is a tough one. I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog.",
        "Since when do you watch the news?",
        "Wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why don't you guys just do it on the street?",
        "Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!",
        "Oh Phoebe, I'm so happy for you honey. (she gives her a kiss)",
        "Geez Ross, you could have showered.",
        "How was the honeymoon?",
        "Oh!",
        "I did not know you spoke French.",
        "Oh... you're so sexy!",
        "Seriously stop it, or I'm gonna jump on ya.",
        "Ross...",
        "My father had an heart attack... (crying) ...while I was at Barney’s.",
        "Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine, but he's still heavily sedated.",
        "No, come on, I'm totally ok. (hugging him) I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own.",
        "Ok. If you really need to.",
        "Oh, I really could.",
        "Ohh... (Ross mouths HA-HA at Monica and takes two cookies and she looks at him angrily)",
        "(stopping a nurse who's coming out of a room) Oh, uhm, excuse me, I'm here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green.",
        "Ross, please, this is a hospital, ok? That actually means something here.",
        "Can somebody please go in?",
        "Ross, please, don't be so scared of him!",
        "Oh! (They enter. Rachel sees his father, lying on a bed, with tubes, drip and everything) Oh! Oh my God! Ohhh, ohhh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain, huh?",
        "Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?",
        "Hi!",
        "Uh. (pause) Did you call your parents?",
        "Oh good.",
        "What?",
        "What do you mean? You've been in my room before!",
        "Ok I gotta tell ya, it's really weird when you use my whole name.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean he is a doctor, you don't expect doctors to get sick!",
        "(she's sad) Ow. I don't want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!",
        "What?",
        "Really, I shouldn't feel guilty?",
        "Ok, maybe you're right.",
        "Wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?",
        "Ok. (She sits on the bed and Ross sits near her) Thank you for coming with me today.",
        "Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room!",
        "I just don't want to be alone tonight.",
        "Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?",
        "Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!",
        "Wow. Ok.",
        "Mhm-mh!",
        "(She turns around very slowly, looks at him for a second and then turns back to her coffee) Sure. (She gives him the cup she was pouring for herself without looking at him)",
        "Hmm-hmm. (starts to pour herself a cup of coffee, never looking at Ross)",
        "(coldly) Yep.",
        "FYI..",
        "In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy s*x... just do it. (she smiles fakely at him)",
        "(sarcastically) Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!",
        "Oh stop that!",
        "(sarcastic) Oh, that is so hot. She walks around him to the other side)",
        "Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.",
        "Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either. (She turns to leave and Ross over takes her and stands infront on her, his back to the row of doors leading to the hospital rooms)",
        "What?",
        "Oh, good.",
        "Okay... Hey listen, just before you go I-I again, I just wanna say \"thank you\" for coming with me.",
        "And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole s*x thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again.",
        "It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good.",
        "Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...?",
        "You know it was you're uhm... birthday...",
        "Well, I guess that's all in the past, now.",
        "(after a pause) Not even one more time?",
        "No matter how much we want it.",
        "That's what we decided.",
        "...It's kinda hard though!",
        "You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that's... just seems like such a... waste.",
        "...Ross?",
        "Just so you know... With us... it's never off the table. (she enters her room and closes the door.)",
        "How was the honeymoon?",
        "Oh!",
        "I did not know you spoke French.",
        "Oh... you're so sexy!",
        "Seriously stop it, or I'm gonna jump on ya.",
        "Ross...",

        "No, come on, I'm totally ok. (hugging him) I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own.",
        "Ok. If you really need to.",
        "Oh, I really could.",
        "Ohh... (Ross mouths HA-HA at Monica and takes two cookies and she looks at him angrily)",
        "(stopping a nurse who's coming out of a room) Oh, uhm, excuse me, I'm here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green.",

        "Really, I shouldn't feel guilty?",
        "Ok, maybe you're right.",
        "Wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?",
        "Ok. (She sits on the bed and Ross sits near her) Thank you for coming with me today.",

        "Just so you know... With us... it's never off the table. (she enters her room and closes the door.)",
        "Ok! Can't believe I'm risking this again, but you're on! All right Joe, you remember the rules! Heads I win, tails you lose.",
        "Oh, that sounds good!",
        "It's all done!",
        "I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I'm having shipped, and that's the sandwich that I made for the plane...",
        "Oh, well. Everything that I need (she takes her bag) is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them.",
        "It should be right next to my plane ticket.",
        "What? Maybe I put it in here (she opens her bag). Oh, oh, it's not in there! Oh, no! I must have packed it in one of these boxes!",
        "Shoot. Oh, I can't believe I did this!",
        "No, no, no. It's ok. I'm gonna be fine.",
        "Well, I've been better.",
        "You guys are gonna come and visit me, right?",
        "I'm gonna miss you so much.",
        "You know what? Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here (they go into the guest room).",
        "Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.",
        "Oh, oh. (she's holding the present, a transparent bag with a white stick in it). What is this?",
        "I'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!",
        "I love you Phoebe.",
        "All right. Well, if I gonna do this, I'd better keep going.",
        "Ok. Monica?",
        "Can you come here with me for a minute?",
        "Mon... Okay... I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me...",
        "(starts crying and speaking at the same time, making it almost impossible to understand what she's saying) I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you...",
        "(says something that cannot be understood)",
        "I... I... I... (again saying something that cannot be understood)",
        "(laughs) Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.",
        "Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...",
        "Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.",
        "(to Chandler) Can I talk to you alone for a minute?",
        "Oh honey...",
        "(all mushy) Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you. (they hug)",
        "Okay. Oh...",
        "Oh!",
        "Oh... (holding Ross's shoulder) Well...",
        "I think I'm gonna take off. (pats Ross on his back, but he looks very surprised)",
        "Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night.",
        "What?",
        "Ross...",
        "You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?",
        "I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.",
        "Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!",
        "What?",
        "WHAT?",
        "He offered me one.",
        "The job is in Paris. (we see Ross stare in disbelief)",
        "Oh, God! Please, somebody say something.",
        "I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.",
        "I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out... Anything we want.",
        "Thank you! Thank you!",
        "I think it is. (Ross looks very sad. Phoebe and Joey enter.)",
        "I got a really incredible job offer.",
        "It's in Paris.",
        "Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. And it means a lot if you could try to get on board.",
        "(walking towards Joey) Joey, it would mean so...",
        "Joey...",
        "Hi.",
        "Oh, well, she’s asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.",
        "Oh, you’re not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back!",
        "Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me.",
        "No, I’m still going.",
        "When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! Isn’t that great?",
        "Hi!",
        "You are never going to believe what happened to me today.",
        "Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money.",
        "Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I don't even know what department that guy's in.",
        "Well, I took it.",
        "(hesitant) Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great. It's certainly the easier choice...",
        "Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can... (she sits down, and Ross who is stunned to hear all this follows her example)",
        "Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared... But this is... fine. This is gonna be good. (they both stare around)",
        "What?",
        "You really think so?",
        "But I already told Zelner that I would come back...",
        "All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris.",
        "Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross!",
        "Oh! Oh, I'm so happy.",
        "So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me.",
        "What?!",
        "Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.",
        "It really was. You've learned some new moves!",
        "Ah.",
        "I know!",
        "Morning!",
        "Hey.",
        "Good. You?",
        "Chick and the duck? Didn't they die...",
        "You too. Last night was just wonderful.",
        "I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.",
        "Uh-huh. I know. It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye. (She hugs him, and Ross looks crushed.)",
        "Hi!",
        "Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.",
        "No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first, and then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.",
        "Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck, Emma!",
        "Yeah?",
        "(touched) Gunther... Oh... I love you too. Probably not in the same way, but I do. And, and when I'm in a café, having coffee, or I see a man with hair brighter than the sun, I'll think of you. Aw.",
        "Oh... Bye guys.",
        "Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. I can't believe they're not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the baby!",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Hi! Oh my gosh!",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh.",
        "What... What...",
        "Aw..",
        "Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful.",
        "Oh, you guys, I can't believe this. But I'll leave now, or I'm gonna miss my plane.",
        "Me too. Oh, I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around to watch you two attempt to handle this! Alright, I can't say goodbye to you guys again. I love you all so much.",
        "I will. Ross, come here.",
        "I just want you to know.. Last night.. I'll never forget it.",
        "Alright, now I really have to go. Okay. Au revoir! Oh, they're gonna really hate me over there.",
        "Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasn't gonna remember any of my high-school French, but I understood every word you just said!",
        "Oh.",
        "Oh, shoot. I had it. Oh, I can't believe this.",
        "I have it, I have it, I have it. Oh, okay, I can't find it, but I remember that I was in seat 32C, because that's my bra-size.",
        "Okay, fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not be having this problem.",
        "Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it? Oh! Oh! I found it! I found it!",
        "Hah! I found it! I told you I would find it! In your face! You're a different person.",

        "Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.",
        "Demi Moore.",
        "Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten.",
        "Oh, oh, oh my god!",
        "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?",
        "Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.",
        "It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.",
        "I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.",
        "Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, you come on in.",
        "Thank you.",
        "You wanna do it right now?",
        "Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andy McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?",
        "Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.",
        "Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my god, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?",
        "I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.",
        "Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.",
        "Woof, woof.",
        "What?",
        "Oh, all right. What did I have?",
        "Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.",
        "I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.",
        "Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.",
        "Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, uh, boobs.",
        "Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.",
        "Ben, dinner!",
        "Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.",
        "I licked my arm, what?",
        "So?",
        "You won't even taste it?",
        "Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?",
        "Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.",
        "Come on. It doesn't taste bad.",
        "You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.",
        "Wait, wait, wait, wait!",
        "You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.",
        "I miss Janice though. \"Hello, Chandler Bing.\"",
        "Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!",
        "I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.",
        "Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?",
        "Nah. Not really.",
        "I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.",
        "Yeah, I just don't buy it.",
        "Ok, don't get me started on gravity.",
        "Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.",
        "Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!",
        "Really? You can actually see it?",
        "See, I didn't know that.",
        "Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?",
        "Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.",
        "Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.",
        "What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.",
        "He's even kind of cute.",
        "I'd call that excessive.",
        "Janice? You called Janice?",
        "Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.",
        "Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.",
        "Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?",
        "I can't believe you caved.",
        "You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?",
        "Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.",
        "Uh huh. Why is that?",
        "Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!",
        "You're there!",
        "Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...",
        "Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.",
        "Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.",
        "Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, \"ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage.\" Little did she know God was thinking, \"Ok, but that's it.\" Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.",
        "I think it went into me.",
        "[Mrs. Adelman's voice] Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.",
        "I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Sit up!",
        "I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.",
        "I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?",
        "[Mrs. Adelman's voice] In my day, divorce was not an option.",
        "That's him.",
        "Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.",
        "Um, do you wanna sit?",
        "I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.",
        "Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?",
        "Everything?",
        "Whoa, that's a lot of stuff.",
        "I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.",
        "[enters] Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.",
        "Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. [Takes Mrs. Green's chin in her hand and says, in Mrs. Adelman's voice] Oh, such a pretty face.",
        "Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.",
        "Sir! No sir!",
        "[Mrs. Adelman's voice] Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.",
        "[Mrs. Adelman's voice] Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! [Phoebe's voice] Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.",
        "I miss Rose.",
        "I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone.",
        "Ok, that's so nice.",
        "Yeah, me, too, technically.",
        "Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.",
        "(singing) I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it. My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget.",
        "(singing) Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.",
        "But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk.",
        "And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.",
        "Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could. ",
        "Really?",
        "Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting. How much am I gonna get?",
        "Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing.",
        "Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.",
        "No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. (Out on the sidewalk, singing) When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity. (Someone puts a coin in her guitar case) Thank you! La la la la la la la....",
        "(singing) ... with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar player?",
        "Right. My name was on there, but now it just says \"carrot cake\". So, um, so um, how many chords do you know?",
        "Oh yeah, so you know D?",
        "Ok, do you know A minor?",
        "Ok, do you know how to go from D to A minor?",
        "Ok. Um, so does your guitar have a strap?",
        "Oh. Mine does. (singing) Stephanie knows all the chords. (makes a face)",
        "(singing angrily) Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!",
        "(singing/screaming) You're all invited to bite me!",
        "Oh, hi.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.",
        "No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang \"Su-Su-Suicide\", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, \"Smelly Cat\", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.",
        "It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money.",
        "Really? From who?",
        "Yeah. Here you go.",
        "No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's \"smelly cat, smel-ly cat\".",
        "Better. Yeah.",
        "Yeah, much better. And you know what, don't feel bad, because it's a hard song.",
        "You wanna try it again?",
        "Ok, there is no top. That's the beauty of Smelly Cat. Um, why don't you just follow me?",
        "Mmmm hmmm.",
        "That's too much. Sorry.\nEND",
        "Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.",
        "I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.",
        "OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.",
        "I might have.",
        "Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything.",
        "Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having s*x with Fun Bobby out on the terrace.",
        "You have a third nipple?",
        "Yeah, is there a hair on it?",
        "Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades.",
        "OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.",
        "Hi.",
        "Ta-da.",
        "Hi.",
        "Do I? Thank you, so do you.",
        "Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy. I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice.",
        "Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo.",
        "OK.",
        "Oh, right, OK. Ole.",
        "Um, the matador. [Duncan leaves] Ole, ha ha ha.",
        "So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.",
        "Ohh. . .K. How come?",
        "What?",
        "Huuh.",
        "I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties.",
        "So how long have you known?",
        "And um, and there's actually a, a woman?",
        "Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?",
        "Sure.",
        "I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'",
        "Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?",
        "So, um, have you told your parents?",
        "[handing him the papers] Here you go. You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who. . . no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't th ink either answer would make me feel better.",
        "So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.",
        "Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls.",
        "I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.",
        "Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.",
        "Hey.",
        "Happy Christmas Eve Eve. [sees Ross's picture frame] Oh my God, where did you get this?",
        "This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.",
        "No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.",
        "No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.",
        "[showing her pictures] OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.",
        "It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother. [turns to leave]",
        "Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?",
        "Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?",
        "Just, you know, to see... um.",
        "OK, is this really my father?",
        "OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.",
        "Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me.",
        "Oh God.",
        "Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?",
        "OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?",
        "[realizes] Oh.",
        "Oh.",
        "Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. . . OK, um, in Ithica. . . alright, um, Saratoga. . . Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information. [hangs up]",
        "Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.",
        "Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.",
        "No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.",
        "Whattaya mean?",
        "Wow. Thank you.",
        "Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! [blows a kiss to a picture of Einstein]",
        "Hey.",
        "Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.",
        "OK, let's go.",
        "Alright, here, you have to hold this. [hands Chandler a piece of paper]",
        "Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.",
        "Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it. [Chandler jumps out of the car]",
        "Ooh, this is it, 74. [screeches to a halt, Joey and Chandler are thrown into the plexiglass wall in the cab]",
        "Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh.",
        "OK, here I go. I'm goin' in.",
        "OK, here I go. . . here I go. . . I'm goin'. [she just sits in the cab]",
        "OK.",
        "Mailbox.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . .",
        "Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.",
        "Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.",
        "Yeah?",
        "You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.",
        "Oh, I couldn't go in.",
        "Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.",
        "Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?",
        "You guuuyys.",
        "Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?",
        "It's Ross.",
        "Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?",
        "Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.",
        "Let's see!",
        "Wow, look at these prices.",
        "Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.",
        "No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.",
        "I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just...",
        "Not for you.",
        "Fine. All right, fine.",
        "Well, then...Let's.",
        "No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, it's like a skit.",
        "Cool.",
        "So...Thank you.",
        "Actually, it makes us feel that big.",
        "I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.",
        "Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.",
        "Fine.",
        "Ok. One.",
        "We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?",
        "Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, \"hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck\".",
        "Oh.",
        "Oh, some guy she met at the movies.",
        "Hang in there, it's gonna happen.",
        "Because she's your lobster.",
        "C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life. You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their tank, ya know, holding claws like. . .",
        "So, do you have any other possibilities?",
        "What is that sparkly thing?",
        "Do you want a refill?",
        "OK. Ooh, OK, you gotta give me a second, I wanna get this just right. [she sticks out her gut, clears her throat and sniffs her nose and then in her best male voice. . .] Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out. That was really good, I think I'm ready for my pen1s now.",
        "It's not that bad.",
        "Chandler, Chandler.",
        "I think she's OK.",
        "Do the claws again.",
        "Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.",
        "Hey now you have two. [Chandler looks annoyed] Oh, now you have two.",
        "[Standing in living room with Chandler and Joey. She pulls a huge bathing suit out of a box] Hey, Mon, what is this?",
        "See, he's her lobster.",
        "I can't believe two cows made the ultimate sacrifice so you guys could watch TV with your feet up.",
        "Hey cool, mine too.",
        "OK, I can be a waitress, I can be a waitress.",
        "I can be a waitress. OK watch this. Um, gimme two number ones, 86 the bacon, one Adam and Eve on a raft and rick'em, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la.",
        "It's James Bond.",
        "[entering the kitchen from the party] That's funny, no. Cadillac, cataract, I get it, no I get it, you stay out there.",
        "You are so smitten.",
        "Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten. You should ask him out.",
        "So. You two are totally into each other.",
        "OK, so what, you're just never gonna see him again?",
        "Didn't you like, just get your eyes checked?",
        "We have got to get you lazy boys out of these chairs.",
        "You know you should go outside and be with the three-dimensional people.",
        "You guys are so pathetic, I, oh, OH, XANADU! OH.",
        "Hey.",
        "Goodnight.",
        "You're not the only one who has a date tonight.",
        "Oh God, absolutely.",
        "Oh you are so lucky.",
        "[looking at a water sculpture that looks like a window with rain running down it] Hey, excellent, excellent water-table thing. ",
        "Yeah, well me too, yeah. I think that's the challenge.",
        "So why don't ya show us the rest of your casa?",
        "Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. You are not gonna believe this. I have just been discovered.",
        "Anyway, OK, now promise you won't like, freak out and say how great this is until I'm done, OK.",
        "OK. I just met this producer of this like, teeny record company, who said that I have a very fresh, offbeat sound and she wants to do a demo of Smelly Cat.",
        "I told you not to do that yet. And, she wants to do a video.",
        "I'm not done yet, OK. God. OK, if that goes well, they may even want to make an album.",
        "I'm done now.",
        "Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?",
        "OK. [singing] Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat [back up singers start singing smelly, smelly, smelly, smelly behind her] Oh woah, oh my God. I mean like, who was that?",
        "OH!! Oh I thought they were just watching me. You know, like at, like at an aquarium, ya know.",
        "OK. [singing] Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat [back up singers - smelly, smelly, smelly, really bad smelly cat, it's not your fault] OK, sorry. I'm just, I'm just not getting that everyone um, gets how smelly this cat acually is. I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the cat.",
        "Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh, check it out, oh check it out. It's Smelly Cat the video.",
        "Now OK, I haven't seen it yet so, if you don't like it, well, so what, none of you ever made a video. [puts the tape in] OK.",
        "Oh my God.",
        "I sound amazing. I, I, I've never heard myself sing before. I mean, except in my own head. Oh, this is so cool, now I can hear what you hear.",
        "Oh, I am sorry but I am incredibly talented.",
        "Hey.",
        "Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video.",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.",
        "Well, I can't work with people who would do this.",
        "I mean this poor woman.",
        "The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a video.",
        "Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels.",
        "[singing] Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Everybody.",
        "Monica.",
        "Chandler.",
        "Rachel.",
        "Uh, Ross, those are the only lines we have, sorry. OK, you guys, once more.",
        "Hey.",
        "Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?",
        "Ahh.",
        "Okey-doke.",
        "Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.",
        "I think on my shoulder. [Ross enters]",
        "Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo.",
        "No, I think you should tell them.",
        "OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?",
        "I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.",
        "Here we go.",
        "You're not going?",
        "What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?",
        "I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?",
        "Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?",
        "OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?",
        "OK, who is the boss of you?!!",
        "No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. GO!!",
        "Oh that looks so good, oh I love it.",
        "Ahh. OK, let's see yours again.",
        "Oh OK. [pulls over her shirt and shows a bare shoulder] Oh no, oh it's gone, that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went.",
        "No.",
        "I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",
        "I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?",
        "Wanna see mine, wanna see mine?",
        "OK, well then what is this? [shows her bare shoulder]",
        "OK, that's my tattoo.",
        "OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.",
        "I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you.",
        "No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.",
        "Why don't you play with your roommate?",
        "Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?",
        "Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?",
        "Oh yeah, it'll be fun. [throws a tennis ball at Eddie's bedroom door]",
        "Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of us had some beers and got to know each other.",
        "Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye.",
        "I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him. [leaves]",
        "And a crusty old man said I'll do what I can and the rest of the rats played moroccas. That's it, thanks, good night.",
        "I know.",
        "Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech. I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the best.",
        "Ok.",
        "Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.",
        "Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture.",
        "Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?",
        "Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?",
        "Why would you kill his fish?",
        "Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks.",
        "But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.",
        "Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say.",
        "Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there.",
        "No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name.",
        "And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.",
        "No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.",
        "Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him.",
        "Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist.",
        "Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'.",
        "Thanks. [gets out of the cab]",
        "[a little dog starts attacking her leg] Hey, hey, no, oh oh.",
        "No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wanna love all animals, please no.",
        "Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap. [Flings the dog off and jumps in the cab. The dog keeps jumping up to the window.] Ok, alright, we have a problem.",
        "Are you crazy?",
        "Yeah, I don't know.",
        "I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.",
        "Ok, thanks. Sorry, again",
        "[innocently] What was that?",
        "[enters] Hey.",
        "Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow.",
        "Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.",
        "I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.'",
        "Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok. [goes over and grabs the phone that's sitting by Monica]",
        "So talk to her.",
        "Hi.",
        "It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose. She's a vegetarian.",
        "Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast.",
        "Sure, oh, is, is Frank home.",
        "Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here?",
        "Oh, ok, um, I mean Frank senior.",
        "Ok so will he be back soon?",
        "Alright, I'm, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry.",
        "Um well I don't really. Just genetically. He's kinda my dad too.",
        "Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?",
        "Oh.",
        "Stilts?",
        "Wow.",
        "I don't know what to do with that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'",
        "That'll work too.",
        "Yeah, that'd be ok.",
        "Ok, I'm in the book.",
        "Alright. So um, stilts huh?",
        "Ok.",
        "Hey nice boobs.",
        "[enters] Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.",
        "Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.",
        "Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.",
        "No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.",
        "Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. [Sees a red bump on her arm.] Oh look!",
        "Yeah? Are you sure, really. [She picks up a mirror and sees the white splotches all over her face.]",
        "I, I, I'm hideous.",
        "Come in.",
        "Hey Ryan, what's up?",
        "Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.",
        "Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.",
        "'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.",
        "Ohh, ohh.",
        "Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.",
        "Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.",
        "And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... [she unveils herself right as a huge lightning bolt crashes outside. Ryan screams in terror.] Oh, I am scary.",
        "I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.",
        "Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.",
        "That you don't stop talking about it.",
        "Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. [She picks up the dice.] Here we go, double sixes, here we go... [She starts to rub the dice all over herself.] Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice...",
        "No. This is what I do for luck, ok.",
        "No.",
        "No. Here. [Throws them on the table.] There. Ooh, double sixes.",
        "Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body. [Grabs a handful of the houses.]",
        "Give it.",
        "Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good. [She starts scratching him.]",
        "Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.",
        "Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.",
        "It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up.",
        "Please. [Ryan pulls the cork with his teeth and spits it into Phoebe's mits.]",
        "I got it. [Wipes it up with her mits.]",
        "What?",
        "Oh.",
        "You know what, that's it, that's it. [She rips off the mits, Ryan follows her lead.]",
        "Ok, I'll walk you out.",
        "I know. We didn't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that. [They kiss.]",
        "Bye you. [Ryan's cab drives off. As Phoebe is going back in, she sees the Central Perk sign in the window and laughs.]",
        "Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.",
        "Why not her?",
        "I'm sorry, I didn't know.",
        "Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.",
        "Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?",
        "Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?",
        "And because you're both, you know, white women.",
        "[cutting Mrs. Greene off] Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon. [they go in the bathroom]",
        "Listen if you wanna go, just go.",
        "Alright, I can get you out.",
        "Shh. In a minute, I'm gonna create a diversion. When I do, walk quickly to the door and don't look back.",
        "Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?",
        "Great, I'm seeing water rings again.",
        "Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute.",
        "No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious.",
        "There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.",
        "Everything you've heard is true.",
        "[enters with the three people she got out] Ok, welcome to the fu-oh.",
        "Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.",
        "Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. [opens the door, the guys are right there] Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.",
        "Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway.",
        "Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.",
        "Hey. Watcha guys doin?",
        "Why are you guys so upset? It's Old Yeller, it's a happy movie.",
        "C'mon, happy family gets a dog, frontier fun.",
        "What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?",
        "Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.",
        "He doesn't have rabies, he has babies. That's what my mom said.",
        "What, what's about to happen? [starts watching] I've never seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun? Oh no, no no Travis, put down the gun. No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller, no, no no, the end, THE END. [hear the gunshot from the TV]\n[Scene:Monica and Rachel's apartment. Richard is on the balcony smoking and Monica is on the phone.]",
        "Hey.",
        "Ok, Love Story, Brian's Song, and Terms of Endearment.",
        "Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.",
        "Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies.",
        "With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.",
        "Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.",
        "Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.",
        "Sure.",
        "Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.",
        "Me too. [leaves]",
        "Hey. Oh thanks for the great movie tip.",
        "Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.",
        "I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, \"It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does.\"",
        "[pauses the tape] Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so. Ok, here we go. [starts the tape again]",
        "Oh, I'm so glad you're here.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oooh, so so so, did you read the book?",
        "Didn't it like totally speak to you?",
        "Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.",
        "Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.",
        "No, 'cause he's yummy.",
        "Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.",
        "Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'",
        "I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.",
        "Um-um, um-um.",
        "Ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind? I would have to say no.",
        "What?",
        "Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date.",
        "Paul.",
        "Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.",
        "I love you goddesses. I don't ever want to suck your wind again.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Is anyone else starting to really like him?",
        "Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing (Chandler and Monica, give her a look that says 'think about it') Ooh.",
        "All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.",
        "Uh-huh, let's go. (they move in to kiss) Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. (they kiss rather passionately) Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.",
        "(laughing) Oh my God, you look so good!",
        "Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?",
        "All right, stop it, you're freaking me out.",
        "I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like.",
        "Come on, like you never talk that.",
        "Bye, good luck.",
        "So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that (points at the computer screen).",
        "What does she mean by HH?",
        "Are you the cutest?",
        "You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy.",
        "It could be like a big giant guy.",
        "We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.",
        "Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'",
        "Well at least we know she's a woman.",
        "Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?",
        "Oh, my.",
        "She wants to meet you in person.",
        "What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.",
        "Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her! (Chandler runs and picks up his shoes) Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww. (Chandler runs to the bathroom, as the computer bing-bongs) No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first. (Chandler runs to the computer) No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much. (Chandler walks slowly into the kitchen)",
        "Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil. I think what you have to do is try not to...",
        "See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's The Boss.",
        "(singing) Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za.",
        "Hi Monica!",
        "Oh my God, has she slept at all?",
        "Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.",
        "Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal. (Ross gives her this look, like 'Yeah, doesn't it', and gets up to dump it down the drain.)",
        "Maybe, because you told him not to.",
        "Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that.",
        "Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.",
        "Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!",
        "No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!",
        "Rach, look! (she holds two buns up to her ears to make her hair look like the Princess Leia 'do.) Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me. (Ross stands up horrified) There he is.",
        "( in a soothing voice) Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place.",
        "All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!",
        "Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.",
        "Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....",
        "All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....",
        "All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....",
        "Monica, do you want us to take you home?",
        "Oh, oh! It's on again!",
        "Hey.",
        "Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! (they all stare at her) Okay,\n        it was me! ",
        "Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean,\n        Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7\n        and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell\n        you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it. (shows\n        him her hand)",
        "Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.",
        "That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my\n        fault.",
        "What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh (starts\n        dialing). ",
        "No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. (on the phone in a different\n        voice) 'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um,\n        is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'",
        "(on phone) 'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey\n        Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak\n        to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to\n        do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns\n        down the apartment, the world does not stop.'",
        "(on phone) 'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition,\n        that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll,\n        what time can you see him?' (to Monica) I need a pen. (Chandler\n        hands her one, but she needs something to right on, so she\n        tilts Chandler's head over and writes on the back of his neck)",
        "Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone\n        again?",
        "(on phone, in 'Katelynn's' voice) 'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay\n        returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have\n        to patch you through.'",
        "(in voice, on phone) 'Okay, go ahead.' (in normal voice on\n        phone) Um, hi Annie. (listens) Fantastic! (to Joey) You got\n        it. (on phone) Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work for scale?' you ask\n        me. Well, I don't know about that, (Joey clears his throat to\n        signify yes) except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are\n        such a sweetheart. I would love to have lunch with you, how\n        about we have lunch next....(hangs up phone) Op, went through\n        a tunnel.",
        "It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone\n        before.",
        "Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.",
        "Two?",
        "Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right",
        "(entering) Helloo! Oh! (sees Joey and starts to leave)",
        "No it's not, sorry.",
        "Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in\n        those....pants.",
        "Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't\n        get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",
        "But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a\n        terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the\n        person who makes your face look like that.",
        "Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry\n        I quit, okay, I just quit.",
        "Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an\n        Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.",
        "Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this\n        job! I...",
        "Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.",
        "Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to\n        work on. ",
        "Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.",
        "No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So,\n        you can work on that. ",
        "Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but\n        dumb'.",
        "Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'",
        "Oh.",
        "Yeah, no, I understand.",
        "Yeah. Sorry. (she starts to leave)",
        "What?",
        "(in a coy tone) Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.",
        "Wow, it’s like a dirty math problem.",
        "Oh, that is so unfortunate.",
        "Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.",
        "You didn’t leave lipstick marks on the phone.",
        "(angrily) Bye-bye! (to Ross) That’s why I moved out.",
        "I think on some levels she already knows.",
        "Okay, well maybe not on those levels.",
        "Why, nobody good?",
        "Oh, really?",
        "So what are they doing?",
        "(to Monica, who’s entering) Hey, you’re early.",
        "I’m just taking it to be re-wired.",
        "No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.",
        "You don’t play the oboe!",
        "Then I’m gonna have to ask you to keep it down. (slams the door in his face.)",
        "Huh?",
        "It’s not in the apartment? (Monica gives a ‘Come on’ look) Oh no. I can’t believe this is happening again.",
        "Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I’ve, I don’t live here anymore.",
        "I’m sorry, I-I-I-I don’t live here anymore. I-I didn’t know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!",
        "That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn’t sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.",
        "Yeah, I would’ve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.",
        "Okay, this is what I’m talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.",
        "Aw, honey it’s not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don’t see that happening.",
        "Aww, good. (they hug) What?",
        "No you’re not, you’re wondering which cushion it is.",
        "Oh, it’s already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?",
        "Oh no! Why?",
        "Oh my God! I don’t believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.",
        "Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?",
        "I’m sorry.",
        "Aw, God Ross. Oh.(goes over and hugs him)",
        "I know no, no, y'know you don’t deserve this, you don’t Ross. You’re, you’re really, you’re so good. (kisses him on the cheek)",
        "And you’re so sweet. (kisses him on the other cheek) And you’re kind (kisses him on the lips)",
        "Huh?",
        "Okay, it’s okay.",
        "Oh. (they start kissing again)",
        "What?",
        "What?",
        "Well, that’s not something a girl wants to hear.",
        "What?",
        "You have chalk on your face.",
        "Oh, Ross you’re right, I don’t know why I always thought this was real grass.",
        "Hey!",
        "No, but he’s always late.",
        "Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, ‘Frank’s always late.’",
        "No, I know, I’m just nervous. Y'know it’s just y'know Mom’s dead, don’t talk to my sister, Grandma’s been sleeping a lot lately. It’s like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You’re so sweet to wait with me.",
        "(entering) Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank.",
        "This is everybody. This is Ross.",
        "Chandler.",
        "Joey.",
        "This is Monica.",
        "And this is Rachel.",
        "I’m gonna get coffee.",
        "Oh yeah! Yeah, no, we’re gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything.",
        "(sits up) Oh, ew!",
        "Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue? Because I can, and my Mom couldn’t, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.",
        "Yeah, yeah. You can do it to. (tries to do it, but can’t)",
        "Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can’t. We don’t have that....",
        "Feburary 16th.",
        "Wow, that’s close. When’s yours?",
        "That’s the same month as Halloween. So, um, what kinda things do you like to do at home?",
        "Okay so, by melting, you meant melting.",
        "So is it like art?",
        "Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom?",
        "Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know I’m just gonna go to bed, I think the fumes are giving me a headache.",
        "G’night, bro.",
        "Here. (gives him a fire extinguisher) Y'know, just in case.",
        "No kind. He just makes it up.",
        "So far, it kinda blows. I don’t know, I just thought y'know that he’d feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and....",
        "Ah!!",
        "Oh, how do you play the shadow game?",
        "I just asked you.",
        "I don’t have time for this.",
        "Which you just gave up really quickly.",
        "Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly.",
        "Yeah. (phone rings and Phoebe answers it) ‘Hello. (listens) Oh my God, I totally forgot! (listens) Well can’t someone else do it. (listens) But, I have company. (listens) Yeah, no look, that’s all right I’ll come in.’ (hangs up phone) Um, Frank, I’m really sorry but I have to go to work. It’s-it’s one of my regulars and he’s insisting that I do ‘um.",
        "Oh! I’m a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.",
        "Well, y'know we don’t call it that, but yeah!",
        "All righty. I’ll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come with me?",
        "No, no, you can get one yourself. It’ll be on the house! Y'know what are big sisters for?",
        "No, no, no, I wouldn’t do you myself, I mean that would be weird. Yeah, no, I’ll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun! Hey! Are you excited?",
        "Hey!-Hey! What’s going on?",
        "You can’t have s*x with her!",
        "Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes.",
        "(turns around and hits Frank) So that’s what you thought I did!! God! That’s not what I do!",
        "Nooo! Why would you think that?",
        "Whatever, it’s the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways.",
        "You really thought it was perfect?",
        "Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?",
        "I don’t....",
        "Right, okay, um-mm.",
        "Yeah, I guess I do, yeah.",
        "Well, I-I wasn’t hopping mad, y'know.",
        "Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now, this.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "She wasn’t a hooker.",
        "Maybe all the rulers are wrong.",
        "Who’s singing?",
        "Ewww! Oh! It’s the Mattress King!",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah, I can’t say croissant. (realises) Oh my God!",
        "Ugh! I don’t know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice’s ex-husband, that’s like betraying Chandler.",
        "(sees a little kid playing with a race car bed) (to kid) Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. (the kid just stares at her, and she makes the ‘that went right over your head’ motion) Woo!",
        "Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler’s your friend... (hops onto the bed) Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.",
        "Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?",
        "Ooooh, nice.",
        "Oh, yay!",
        "Oh. (goes and answers the door and there is this huge black delievery guy.)",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It’s that bedroom there. (points to Monica’s room)",
        "Yeah, so please, please, please, don’t say anything to Chandler.",
        "Is that a problem?",
        "Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let’s see what you got. All right ya, put ‘em up. Come on. (they start shadow boxing)",
        "Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren’t acting Christian enough.",
        "Oh! Oh! Oh!",
        "Wow! And I’m a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I’m sorry, we’ll put some ice on it.",
        "‘Kay, put your head back.",
        "All right, I have ya. Oh God.",
        "Oh, it’s the compulsively neat one by the window, okay.",
        "I’m, I’m freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn’t have! All right, I haven’t lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?",
        "I am soo dead. (goes to Monica’s room)",
        "Isn’t it cool! Varoom! Varoom!",
        "I know, you must’ve won like a contest or something!",
        "I’m sorry, okay, I-I wasn’t looking, and the store says that they won’t take it back because you signed for it...",
        "When I was you! Y'know what, it’s all Joey’s fault, ‘cause he left his nose open!",
        "It’s Monica’s bed. What?",
        "So. This has always been Monica’s bed, what you’re just noticing now, how self-involved are you?",
        "Well, if you really, really want it, then it’s okay.",
        "Have fun. Oh wait, no, don’t! I forgot I am totally against that now.",
        "No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. (to Joey) Hey, how do you sleep at night?",
        "Really?",
        "(walking up to Joey) Hey.",
        "Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, (looks at the tree) oh, but oh...",
        "Destiny.",
        "Yes.",
        "Okay. (One of Joey’s co-workers, walks by with a dead tree.) Yikes! That one doesn’t look very fulfilled.",
        "You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.",
        "So, what happens to the old guys?",
        "Why, do I have a feeling that’s not as happy as it sounds? (Joey points out one going into the chipper to her, as this haunty, demonic music starts to play in the background) No! Nooooo!!! (she winces in horror and hides her face against Joey’s shoulder, as she sees the tree spit out from the chipper.)",
        "(running up carrying a tree) Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you don’t want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one. (points to the almost dead tree she has)",
        "Okay but that’s why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it’s Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey",
        "Well look no further, (shows her the dead one) this one’s yours! Ahhh.",
        "All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one! I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to get so emotional, I guess it’s just the holidays, it’s hard.",
        "Oh, I wasn’t even thinking about that.",
        "This is the worst Christmas ever.",
        "Oh! Oh my God!",
        "You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you’re the best!",
        "Oh, God bless us, everyone.",
        "Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.",
        "Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. (just as she sits down).",
        "Oh, can I play too? I’ve never played football, like ever.",
        "Yay!!",
        "Okay, so how do we decide that?",
        "Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle.",
        "Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?",
        "Yeah.",
        "What’s block?",
        "I thought you meant in life.",
        "Go! Go! Go!",
        "Oh I got it!! (catches the ball) Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!",
        "Touchdown!! Touchdown!!",
        "Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Woo-yay!!",
        "I love this game!!",
        "Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!",
        "All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?",
        "Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.",
        "Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.",
        "Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn’t the play still going.",
        "Isn’t there a national football league.",
        "Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?",
        "No, no, it’s just my tooth.",
        "No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can’t see him.",
        "Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.",
        "Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there\n        was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend\n        ‘Albino Bob’.",
        "Yes, while I was in the chair! That’s why I take such good\n        care of my teeth now, y'know, it’s not about oral hygiene, I\n        floss to save lives!",
        "Well tell that to them. Oh! You can’t, their dead.",
        "(trying to bite into an apple) Ow! Ow! (drops the apple in\n        disgust.)",
        "All right, fine, fine, but if you’re my next victim, don’t come\n        back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.",
        "Although, don’t feel like you can’t visit.",
        "Well, you could wait ‘til I go to the dentist, maybe I’ll kill\n        him.",
        "Well, I’m going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the\n        look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or,\n        or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay,\n        And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that\n        um...... (starts to cry and runs out)",
        "(running through the door) No! Oh! You’re alive! You’re\n        alive!",
        "Yeah, well, we’ll see about that. Can I use your phone? I\n        just wanna call everyone I know.",
        "(on phone) ‘Hey! You’re not dead! Okay, see ya!’",
        "(rushing in) Okay. If you’re alive you answer your phone!",
        "Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I\n        know, and everyone is alive.",
        "What?",
        "Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this\n        curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.",
        "I’m telling you he’s dead. What we are about to have here\n        is a dead fat guy on a stick.",
        "He’s alive! He’s a-live!!!",
        "(joining him) ‘Love....’",
        "‘I’ll be a fool for you. I’m sure, you know I\n                     don’t mind.’",
        "‘Yes! You mean the world the world to me.\n                     Oh..’",
        "‘I know.’",
        "‘I’ve found....’",
        "‘...in you, my endless (Phoebe goes high\n                     pitched, Chandler goes low pitched) love.’ (they\n                     both look at each other.) ‘My endless love.’ (once\n                     again they don’t match tones, and they just look\n                     at each other)",
        "Why don’t you go up there and ask him to ‘step lightly, please?’",
        "Ooh, that is silly. (gets up) I’ll go up there, I’ll tell him to keep it down.",
        "(muffled through the floor) Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... (I tired but the rest is unintelligible).",
        "(muffled) Oh, thank you.",
        "Well, he’s very charming.",
        "Well, you’re just gonna have to try.",
        "(to one of his sisters, Cookie) Hey!",
        "Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice.",
        "Wow. Okay, I don’t know how to talk to you.",
        "Where’d you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.",
        "Why, what happened?",
        "How can you not know which one?",
        "We didn’t fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!",
        "Oh well y'know. (laughs)",
        "Ick, you were eavesdropping.",
        "Oh, I’m sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me.",
        "Thanks you guys! Thank you.",
        "God, I hope they kick his ass!",
        "(entering, with about 20 purses hanging around her neck) Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses!",
        "Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.",
        "Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it.",
        "A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich�. Why don't you get a magician?!",
        "Well, can you dance at all?",
        "(covering her mouth in shock) What, what is that?",
        "Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita?",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!",
        "What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, (reading) 'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!",
        "Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "What are you wrapping?",
        "Yeah, it's a vase.",
        "Well not exactly like the one in the poem.",
        "Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh. (hugs her)",
        "(entering, holding a pair of Roller Blades) Hi.",
        "Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that’s he’s going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff.",
        "I’m going to let him.",
        "Oh, there’s no such thing as an innocent burger.",
        "Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.",
        "(to Robert) You’ve have lipstick right here (points to her cheek). That’s okay, it’s mine, we just kissed.",
        "I’ll have coffee.",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.",
        "Oh, I get more because I’m dainty.",
        "Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter?",
        "What? (the guys keep laughing.) What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert? (the guys keep laughing.) Why are you laughing?!",
        "You guys!! Come on!",
        "What do you mean?",
        "Hey.",
        "Hey. Ooh! Don’t sit down!",
        "Yeah. And, first here’s a gift.",
        "That’s all right, that’s well, I figured.... (they start to leave as Joey enters.)",
        "Listen, Robert’s gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?",
        "Please, right now, no, every time I see him it’s like ‘Is it on the lose?’ ‘Is it watching me?’",
        "Hey.",
        "No, I can spot you from here.",
        "Okay, listen Robert...",
        "Umm, I think you’re really, really great...",
        "I-I-I-I-I don’t know, I don’t know what to say.",
        "Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.",
        "(to Chandler) Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?",
        "Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she’s done.",
        "Oh no, one of those ‘look for the hidden meaning’ songs.",
        "Hey Leslie, how’d you know I’d be here?",
        "Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.",
        "Hmm, bummer.",
        "No. But thanks.",
        "Okay. No. But thanks.",
        "Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y’know. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. (to Monica) Can I have a tissue, please?",
        "Where’s Chandler?",
        "Oh. (takes her beeper puts in a pot, covers it, and puts the pot in the oven)",
        "Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. That’s the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!",
        "Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together.",
        "You never run on a barge!",
        "Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!",
        "It’s just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn’t called. Not that I even care, y'know.",
        "You think you know me so well.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That’s what I said.",
        "I can’t. I can’t. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was ‘Okay, bye Pheebs’ gone. Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I’ve ever had in like all my lives.",
        "(singing) I stepped in something icky.",
        "(singing) Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, it’s not your fault.",
        "Oh, yeah!",
        "I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.",
        "Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I’d be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.",
        "That’s okay. All right, I’m gonna play song that’s really, really sad. It’s called Magician Box Mix Up. (she turns her guitar upside down to play it.)",
        "(to Leslie) Oh, I thought you weren’t coming. What? Where were you?",
        "Okay, don’t give me a reason to get mad, okay",
        "No, look, I told you that I didn’t want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would’ve done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can’t trust you then just forget it.",
        "Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won’t be partners. So what’s it gonna be?",
        "Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life’s gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song?",
        "Okay. (singing) ‘Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.’ That’s all I have so far.",
        "(entering) Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas!",
        "I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages outside the UN and, I don’t know where his country is.",
        "Oh!! That’s my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace.",
        "Ick-neck-tree-anis..... There’s a ‘g’ in there.",
        "In your atlas!",
        "Oh.",
        "Oh.",
        "Umm, well he’s very dashing, y'know, and umm, very, very sophisticated, and he doesn’t speak any English, but according to his translator, he totally gets me.",
        "What is this?",
        "Me too. Although this city is my home, so. So that’s dumb what I said, don’t tell him I said that. Umm, you make something up. (Mischa does so and Sergei kisses her hand.) Nice, (to Mischa) thank you. This is me. Here.",
        "(to Mischa) Thank you, very much! Oh! (to Sergei) Thank you!",
        "(to Mischa) Okay, y'know what, you don’t have to do that now. (Mischa translates that to Sergei) No-no-no-no!! Not him, you don’t! (Mischa tells Sergei he can proceed and steps away) Well the moment’s over.",
        "Oh.",
        "(pointing to the globe) See there it is right there.",
        "Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.",
        "Yeah. Except for, y'know when you’re on a date and you’re getting along really great but the guy’s translator keeps getting in the way.",
        "(to Monica) Anyway, I’m going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator’s date? So that when we, it’s time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he’s really, he’s kinda cute.",
        "Hey, don’t call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!",
        "(laughing and banging her spoon on the table) Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.",
        "You didn’t say Boutros Boutros Gali.",
        "Interesting.",
        "Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.",
        "Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. (Behind the menu) What are you doing?",
        "Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven’t been able to say two words to each other.",
        "That would be great. Thank you.",
        "Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don’t accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it.",
        "Well, tell him, apology accepted.",
        "Excuse me, but umm, isn’t he paying for your dinner?",
        "Plate! Yes, plate.",
        "See, we don’t need them.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Ameri-can.",
        "Ameri-can. Y'know it’s a very hard language. Let’s do it again.",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?",
        "Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.",
        "The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.",
        "Now what is Fabutec?",
        "Waxine!!",
        "Oh, it’s incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.",
        "God. Do think it really doesn’t hurt? ‘Cause how can they do that?",
        "They have the best stuff in there.",
        "(reading from the instructions) After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,",
        "Grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.",
        "Was it not pain-free?",
        "Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’t seem to think it’s that bad.",
        "(Removing one of the strips) Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!",
        "Oh!!",
        "Ow!!!",
        "Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!",
        "We’re all right.",
        "We’re all right.",
        "For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.",
        "Oh yeah, come here. (Puts a little wax on Joey’s arm and puts a strip on it.)",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "(to Joey) What, what are they talking about?",
        "Whe-where did he put it?!",
        "Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.",
        "Should we do something?",
        "Hi, it’s Phoebe. Listen someone’s gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, ‘cause it’s like 9:15 now, and I’m not there.",
        "We could eat the wax! It’s organic.",
        "No, not the used wax.",
        "They’re gonna get through this, aren’t they?",
        "Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.",
        "They’ve been quiet for a long time.",
        "Oh come on, they can be in the same room.",
        "Why? What happened now?",
        "Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He’s the one who slept with someone else.",
        "Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you’re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.",
        "Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....",
        "Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.",
        "(turning around and picking a cup off of a table) Oh, hey, look, I found coffee! (handing her the cup) Okay, let’s skedaddle.",
        "Okay, your highness.",
        "(in a deep voice, imitating Ross) Um, Rachel I’m really sorry. (imitating Rachel) That’s okay, do you wanna get back together? (imitating Ross) Yeah, okay. (in her normal voice) Did anyone else hear that?!",
        "Hey!",
        "No, it’s just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.",
        "Ohhh boy, do I feel bad.",
        "Chandler what are you doing?!",
        "Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?",
        "Him? Him, Ross?",
        "Wait. Really?! ‘Cause mine get me out of tickets.",
        "Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel’s sister’s cabin. (Chandler goes back to the window to smoke again.)",
        "Y'know what, I can stay, I’m gonna stay. ‘Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.",
        "Chandler!!",
        "What does the sign say?",
        "No, the ‘No Smoking’ sign. There’s no smoking in my Grandmother’s cab.",
        "Please!",
        "(to Rachel, who’s staying in the cab.) Aren’t you gonna go?",
        "No, y'know what don’t close it (Rachel slams the door shut locking themselves out.) ‘cause the... keys...are in there.",
        "Okay, Monica’s are the biggest.",
        "All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.",
        "(finishing removing her bra) Okay, there.",
        "Okay. (The car moves a few feet and sputters to a stop.) Oh, no!",
        "Yeah, this has happened before.",
        "Yep. Put more gas in.",
        "Okay, yeah. (to Monica and Rachel) Triple A can pick us up.",
        "Yeah, what town are we near?",
        "(to Monica) Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we’re on?",
        "Okay. (on phone) We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. (to Rachel) There is no Route 27. (listens) (to Rachel) Okay, either 93 or 76?",
        "Okay. (on phone) Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? (listens) Okay! (hangs up) Yeah, no they don’t do that.",
        "But if...",
        "Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.",
        "(answering the phone) (whispering) Ross, thank God.",
        "I ate a bug.",
        "Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don’t know where we are, so we can’t get a tow truck.",
        "Yes, please.",
        "Oh, it’s Ross on one of his drives!",
        "Hi!",
        "(to Chandler and Monica) You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we’re then gonna go skiing?",
        "Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.",
        "Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! (they all stop fighting, Chandler continues to dance.) Look what you’re doing to Chandler!! (Chandler finally stops) (to Ross and Rachel) Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? (Ross starts to leave) You don’t, all right you don’t have to love each other, okay? You don’t, you don’t even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.",
        "Yeah, otherwise, I mean that’s, that’s, that’s just it for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? (they both look away) Can you be civil?",
        "Okay. Good, all right, let’s get back in the car, ‘cause it’s freezing, and my chest is unsupported.",
        "Maybe we can like go to a movie or something.",
        "Or, or the rodeo!!",
        "Okay!",
        "Bye!!!",
        "Oh, it’s so great to see you feeling like this!",
        "Wait, am I missing something though? ‘Cause I thought death was something that’s supposed to be sad, in a way.",
        "Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.",
        "No, just a barrel.",
        "Really?! Really?!",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It’s so beautiful.",
        "So, I’m here, ready to play.",
        "I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha. (She removes this large ceramic dog that comes up to the second floor and places it next to the house.)",
        "That’s a dog, every house should have a dog.",
        "Well, maybe it’s so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.",
        "No, no, that’s the ghost for the attic.",
        "Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you’ve got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.",
        "Okay, obviously you don’t know much about the U.S. government.",
        "(holding a dinosaur) Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! (the dinosaur starts attacking the house. She starts to bark like a dog.) Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!",
        "Okay, (starts to pack up her stuff) fine. Come dinosaur, we’re not welcome in the house of no imagination.",
        "The little ones do.",
        "Hey!",
        "Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!",
        "Look, look! (She lifts up the roof, and the front panel falls revealing the interior.)",
        "Oh, okay, it’s the slide instead of stairs. Watch this. (She slides a doll down the slide)",
        "The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.",
        "Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room? (lights some incense)",
        "Watch, watch. (She turns a strand of Christmas lights strung around the house.)",
        "And, and! (She turns on a bubble maker.)",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "What?! Oh my... (sees the remains of the house) Oh my God!! What happened?!",
        "All right. Did everyone get out okay?",
        "Ohh. What is this? (She sees a tissue covering something, and moves to remove it.)",
        "(She pauses to ready herself, and removes the tissue.) Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!",
        "All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.",
        "Oh my God!!",
        "Frank! Hi!",
        "What are you doing here?",
        "What happened?",
        "But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?",
        "Your getting married?!",
        "My little brother’s getting married!!",
        "Do I?",
        "Yeah, I do, yeah.",
        "Yeah, isn’t it fantastic?",
        "What, he’s 18.",
        "Yeah, I’m a big surprise.",
        "Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you’re ready for that?",
        "Oh good! Okay. ‘Cause you were acting like you didn’t.",
        "No, I know, I know, that this is Frank’s life, (walks behind them, they turn around in the leather chairs to face her) y'know. Y'know, I don’t want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it’s sick and wrong!",
        "No-no, oh, I’m fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it’s tongue down my little brother’s throat!",
        "But, I mean, do you think he’s gonna enjoy it when he’s up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank, (she walks behind them again, and hey again turn to follow her) and it-it’s not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it’s not good home economics.",
        "Yes. Not out loud.",
        "Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he’s gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can’t. (pause) But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.",
        "Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!",
        "Okay, I’m gonna go get Frank. (exits)",
        "(to Joey) You’re Frank’s best man?!",
        "Well then, (to Ross) what about you?! Huh?!",
        "Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I’m so glad you could come, ‘cause I’ve got a real umm, Home Ec emergency. (Points to the table cloth, which has a huge mustard stain on it.)",
        "Yeah, I know. It’s a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?",
        "Y'know what, forget it. It’s ruined.",
        "Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.",
        "Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?",
        "Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?",
        "What umm, what happened?",
        "Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?",
        "Yeah, yeah, no, I don’t, I don’t know. But, y'know what, maybe it’s just all for the best?",
        "Oh, sweetie, oh. (hugs him)",
        "Uh, well I can tell you why. It’s, it’s because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?",
        "Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn’t be together, y'know. And you’re gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay, but.",
        "Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn’t. There’s someone here who can explain this better than I can.",
        "Yeah, but not just that.",
        "None the less.",
        "That’s right, exactly. (sees them) All right, it’s a good bye kiss, that’s good. (Frank picks Alice up and they move to the couch) Bye-bye. (They both lie down on the couch and start to make out.) Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I’m saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. (They ignore her) Okay, I’ve decided I’m gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? (She reaches in and Alice moans) Okay, all right, good. (leaves).",
        "We were out of Doritos.",
        "Oh.",
        "Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.",
        "What, so what are you gonna tell him?",
        "Huh.",
        "Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you’re not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.",
        "Okay, so it’s probably just the Ross thing then.",
        "So, you’re like a zillionaire? (Pete smiles and nods)",
        "Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.",
        "Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.",
        "Yeah, kinda.",
        "(to Chandler) Hey! (Chandler looks up, startled) Why isn’t it Spiderman? Y’know like Goldman, Silverman...",
        "It isn’t?",
        "Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!",
        "Okay well, he would turn things to gold.",
        "Ahh, his work is done.",
        "Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!! (they both kick up the foot rests like an old fashioned gun fight.)",
        "Oh my God, they took my idea!",
        "Yeah! Okay, here you go. (rolls her back to Rachel)",
        "Oh my God, are you guys okay?",
        "Umm, oh, about three months.",
        "Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?",
        "Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this\n        age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right\n        food, and lot’s and lot’s of love.",
        "(to Pete) Wow! That’s exciting, you went to Japan, made up a\n        woman.",
        "I’m just saying, this woman, I mean she’s fictitious. No?",
        "‘Cause you’re still into Monica. So you told her there was\n        somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so ‘cause\n        you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe\n        something might happen, and...",
        "Yeah, no, I’m fairly intuitive and psychic. It’s a substantial\n        gift.",
        "Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?",
        "No I’m serious. I mean I’m intuitive, but my memory sucks.",
        "Hey! ",
        "What?",
        "Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.",
        "Ooh, I have to tell you something.",
        "But I can’t tell you.",
        "Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn’t\n        tell, and I swore to like all my gods.",
        "No.",
        "No.",
        "No, but let’s come back to that later!",
        "Noo!",
        "Oh, wait, wait. Clogs, or claws?",
        "No.",
        "No.",
        "(Shaking her head yes) No!",
        "I don’t know! (frantically points at Monica)",
        "I can’t!!",
        "I, but you’re so close! No!",
        "Oh, just go. You’re never gonna get it!",
        "All right, so, so you went to Pete’s...",
        "So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?",
        "No-no-no oh, keep your name, don’t take his name.",
        "Well then definately don’t take his name.",
        "(intrigued) Oh?!",
        "(disappointed) Oh.",
        "Yeesh, what’d you do about it?",
        "Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?",
        "Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?",
        "Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren’t together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you’re not cool with it...",
        "You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She’s yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...",
        "Great! Okay, good for you! (as they leave she slaps Rachel on the butt)",
        "Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie. (who has hair by the way)",
        "(to Bonnie) Well I hope you have fun tonight.",
        "Yeah, she was bald, she’s not now.",
        "I don’t know, I hardly ever say that about people.",
        "Well I’m sorry, I thought you said it was okay.",
        "Well, maybe it won’t work out. Maybe Ross won’t like her personality.",
        "Oh no, Bonnie’s the best!",
        "So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?",
        "Ohh, that’s too bad!",
        "Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.",
        "Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?",
        "Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?",
        "No! No! Look at that! (drags her away from the window) It’s a line of ants! They’re working as a team!",
        "(looking in the window) Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let’s go.",
        "Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.",
        "You said it was okay!",
        "What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!",
        "Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don’t get it. Aren’t you the one that decided that you didn’t want to be with Ross?",
        "Well isn’t he your friend? Don’t you want him to be happy?",
        "So?",
        "(sits down next to her and hugs her) Oh no.",
        "Oh, we killed them all.",
        "Wait, if that’s his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?",
        "(to her date) Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music. (points to the stage)",
        "Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people.",
        "Vince is a fireman.",
        "Okay. (watches him leave)",
        "Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.",
        "I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.",
        "Does a dog's lips move when he reads? (Joey makes an `I don't know' face, and looks to Chandler and Rachel, who're also stumped) Okay, no they don't.",
        "That is so great! Oh, I... (sees that a parked car near them has caught on fire) Oh my God!",
        "(the fire has worsened) Oh my God!!!",
        "(stopping him) No! No!",
        "Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic. (hears the sound of approaching sirens) Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out of here!",
        "Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay? (she drags him away)",
        "(entering with Rachel) …and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.",
        "(disgusted) Uh.",
        "Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field.",
        "Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's so burly, he's sooo very burly. (giggles)",
        "Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Jason is not a sissy!",
        "God, that is the nicest kitchen.",
        "No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day.",
        "All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.",
        "Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it’s just Jason’s so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it’s just better than having just like a really, really, really nice (pause) butt. (Her eyes glaze over thinking about the butt.) (pause) Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!",
        "Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?",
        "Wow! I didn’t know you guys actually used those.",
        "Umm, wow. This-this isn’t gonna be easy. Umm, I don’t think we should see each other anymore.",
        "I’m sorry.",
        "Oh my God, I didn’t…",
        "(running after him) Wait-wait-wait! Wait!!",
        "(to Ross) I’m telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.",
        "(gasps) Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. (They both look at her.) Like for clubbing.",
        "Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?",
        "No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he’s incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.",
        "Yeah, well he’d prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.",
        "Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and… Okay so Jason is sensitive, (holds up one finger) but now so’s Vince (holds up one finger on her other hand) Plus, Vince has the body y'know? (holds up two more fingers on the Vince side) So… It’s really just about the math.",
        "(knocks on the door) Jason?",
        "Nah-ha!",
        "(singing) “Crazy underwear, creepin’ up my butt. (Jason enters) Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under-(sees Jason)-wear…” (In her head) Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep playing. You’ll get through this; you’ll be fine. (She tries to continue the song, but she has lost the ability to pronounce words, and the lyrics come out as gibberish.) (giving up on the song) Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show.",
        "Hey!",
        "I don’t know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!",
        "Yeah, okay, I’ve-I’ve been dating both of you, and it’s been really horrible. ‘Cause y'know it’s been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I like you both, and I, and I didn’t know how to chose, so... I’m sorry, I’m just, I’m terrible, I’m a terrible person. I’m terrible.",
        "Really?!",
        "Well, this is none of my business. (starts to walk away)",
        "Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park.",
        "(to Vince) Well, that could’ve been really awkward.",
        "Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I’m gonna do that for you.",
        "Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he’s at Flimby’s.",
        "Oh, yeah, that’s the word I use when I can’t remember the real thing.",
        "No! Rachel, that’s what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow, if I don’t get through, they’re not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! It’s us versus them!",
        "Like a date type (looks at Rachel) person?",
        "Thanks!",
        "Okay. (on phone) Ooh, I’m setting the phone down. (does so) But I’m still here! Just don’t go anywhere I’m still here. (starts to put on the sweater) Don’t-don’t switch or anything, ‘cause I’m, I’m right here. (She has pulled the sweater over her head, but her head is stuck in a sleeve.) Just one sec. One sec! One second!! (She is now frantically trying to get the sweater on, as Monica returns from the bathroom.) Wait! One second! Just…",
        "What?! Monica, I’m scared!!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yes!! Yes!! I’m the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.",
        "No.",
        "Oh, is the play over?",
        "Nah. I kept myself busy.",
        "Oh, okay, yeah. (to Monica) I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff in your room.",
        "No, no, I’m fine, and y’know why? ‘Cause of all the riboflavin.",
        "I’m so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see you’re play. I swear you’re play is very important to us, thank you for your patience. You’re play is the next play is the next play I’m gonna see.",
        "Oh, I… (starts jabbering incoherently)",
        "I do, I believe you.",
        "Yeah. But I also believed her (points to the phone) when she said I was next.",
        "Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it’s one of those 801 numbers. Right?",
        "No, no, no, oh no-no-no, it’s has to be 800. (picks up the instruction manual to check the phone number) ‘Cause all those big companies have 800 numbers, every one. (Finds the number) Yeah, every big Utah-based company has one.",
        "Sorry, I’m so sorry, I will pay you back.",
        "Fine! Fine! (slams the phone down, breaking it) Oh-oh!",
        "Well, I think I broke it. But that’s all right, here’s the number you can call.",
        "(entering, hurridly) Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look\n        at this! (She hands Chandler a picture) That’s my Mom’s\n        writing! Look.",
        "Y'know what that means?",
        "No-no, that’s not, that’s not me Phoebe, that’s her pal\n        Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like\n        B.F.F. (Ross and Bonnie look at her quizzically) Best Friends\n        Forever.",
        "I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of\n        stories about my parents, and she might even know like where\n        my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach.\n        So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?",
        "So great! Okay! Tomorrow we’re gonna drive out to Montauk.",
        "Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this\n        woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy\n        back gives me his beach house.",
        "Oh, I wasn’t talking about his karma.",
        "And this time, they’ve ganged up to form one giant, super hat.",
        "Oy!!",
        "Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.",
        "(at the door) Knock, knock, knock.",
        "(entering) Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?",
        "Hi Phoebe Abott, I’m your best friends daughter!",
        "No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here. (hands her the\n        picture) Lily, from high school. Remember?",
        "(points to herself) Phoebe. (points to her) Phoebe. Phoebe,\n        yeah. She named me after you I guess.",
        "Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That’s my Dad, that’s Frank! Yeah! I’m\n        sorry I’m getting all flingy.",
        "No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks. ",
        "(goes and gets some cookies) Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I’ve\n        been, I’ve been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard\n        from him, or seen him?",
        "(disappointed) Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my\n        parents. Everything.",
        "Oh, what? What was it?",
        "(happily) Yeah, no, it was great.",
        "(entering) Oh, hey!",
        "Oh, so, how are we doing?",
        "I’m kind, caring, and sweet. What’s Monica like?",
        "Ohh, I think she knows where my Dad is.",
        "She was acting, she was pretending like she hasn’t heard from\n        him on years, but I found this picture on her fridge, and look\n        (shows Monica)! Isn’t this what he would look like now?",
        "I don’t know, but we’re having dinner tomorrow night, so I\n        figured, she’s gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just\n        wanted to give him time to, buy me presents, I don’t know! So,\n        you’re all bored?",
        "All right, I’m gonna close my eyes and point to someone, and\n        you, whoever I point has to come up with something fun for us\n        to do, and we have to do it. ",
        "Okay.",
        "Okay. (Starts to spin) Ooh, y'know we could just do this. (She\n        stops at Chandler)",
        "Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody\n        take off one item of clothing. It hasn’t happened yet, but\n        we’re all very excited.",
        "Come on, take ‘em off!!",
        "Shhh! Shhhh! Joey’s asleep.",
        "After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him\n        warm.",
        "She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!",
        "Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. She’s\n        avoiding me, she doesn’t want to tell me where my Father is.\n        She knows, and she won’t tell me.",
        "Yeah, well, don’t \"Aww Pheebs, that sucks!\" me yet. (she starts\n        to leave)",
        "Well, she’s out of town so, there’s gotta be something in her\n        house that tells me where my Father is.",
        "Well, are any of those people here?!",
        "Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? I’ll-I’ll fill her\n        ice trays.",
        "Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. (She manages to climb completely\n        inside and the window slams shut.) Oh, shhh!",
        "No! No!! It’s me! It’s me! I-I didn’t want to make any noise!",
        "I’m sorry.",
        "I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.",
        "Umm, okay, okay, look. I took this picture from your fridge.\n        Okay, because I know that this is my Father. Yeah, this is\n        Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him.\n        Now, look I deserve to know where I came from. All right? So\n        if you can help me find my Father then you should! Otherwise,\n        you’re just mean! (pause) So, just tell me the truth!",
        "My Father is Chuck Magioni?",
        "Oh.",
        "Heh?",
        "(screaming, angrily) ...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!! (applause) (happily) Thank you, thanks.",
        "Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?",
        "Yeah, I actually don’t know...",
        "Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on, you! (goes over and picks up the cat) Come on. Crazy. (looks into the cat’s eyes) Oh my God.",
        "Nothing. Nothing.",
        "I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.",
        "No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.",
        "No Dr. Skeptismo! I’m sure. First of all, okay, there’s the feeling. (Chandler shrugs) Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. (Rachel nods her head in unsure agreement) My Mother’s favourite fish is Orange Roughy... (Joey thinks he understands, but then nods that he has no clue.) Cats....like....fish! (Ross and Rachel are totally lost) (to the cat) Hi, Mommy. (Rachel covers her mouth, in an “Oh my God.” gesture) Oh, I haven’t seen this smile in 17 years!",
        "(is struggling with the cat) Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.",
        "Well, I’m not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there’s y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she’s worried that y'know, she’s gonna, she’s gonna be replaced. (to the cat, in a funny voice) Well, that’s not gonna happen is it? Noo. (gets up) Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.",
        "Well, I’m returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word. (goes into Monica’s room)",
        "(entering, with Julio) Hi. (sits down in the chair)",
        "Yeah?",
        "So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.",
        "I just feel so, uhh.....",
        "Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo.",
        "Yeah? (sees Ross) Hi!",
        "Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?",
        "(she turns around and puts the cat on the entertainment center) Ross, how many parents have you lost?",
        "Okay, then you don’t know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I’m wrong, who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive.",
        "Okay.",
        "I think she would like that.",
        "Thank you. We both forgive you.",
        "Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you’re welcome to come back anytime.",
        "Come on, Mom, I’ll take you home.",
        "Hey! New wallet, huh?",
        "Oh please, somebody tell me I don’t have to go to work today!",
        "Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I’m not allowed to charge for.",
        "Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it’s against my oath as a masseuse.",
        "No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one’s actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.",
        "No, I can handle it. No, I’m a professional. (She starts to leave)",
        "I don’t what your talking about. (Laughs nervously and continues to leaqve)",
        "Because it’s Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!",
        "These old things.",
        "You mean the—Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.",
        "Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y’know, real (lifts up the towel) nice and tight. So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.",
        "Oh. (She goes to work, and her head slowly drops out of view.)",
        "No!",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.",
        "On the touchy.",
        "No, I know! I-I’m sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.",
        "(thinking to herself) Okay, baseball. Rick, playing baseball. Okay, slides into second, maybe even his pants come down a little… Oh no—wait no, no! No! Okay, all right, sandwiches, sandwiches. Umm, okay, on a plate, maybe Rick’s pants come down a little. No! No! Okay, Chandler! Okay Chandler, ooh, that’s working.",
        "(thinking to herself) Chandler’s knees. Chandler’s… ankles. Chandler’s ankle hair. (notices the clock) Oh no. (to Rick) Okay, you’re all set.",
        "Yeah! In… really long hour world.",
        "Ugh, okay, I have an enormous crush on you. But because you’re a client, I can’t ask you out, even though you give me y’know, the feeling.",
        "Really?!",
        "What?",
        "(laughs) Okay, quit down. (they start to kiss again)",
        "Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isn’t what it looks like, ‘cause Rick is my ahh, husband.",
        "Yes, I will tell her.",
        "Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.",
        "It’s so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!",
        "I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next, y’know? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then these policemen, thought I was a whore too. It’s been a really bad day, whore wise.",
        "Yeah, they thought I was a whore.",
        "Great! Thank you very much.",
        "How come?",
        "Okay, I didn’t hear that.",
        "Wow! And hey, it’s cool if you’re a lesbian! (Gives her a thumbs up)",
        "That’s weird.",
        "Your nails.",
        "Oh, no, I meant that it’s weird that you only have nine now.",
        "Okay, don’t panic. I’m gonna go to the store, I’m gonna get you another set of nails, no one’s gonna know, and you’re gonna look great. (She runs over to get her coat.) Oh! Oh, it’s ‘cause they’re gonna eat—that’s the problem.",
        "And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!",
        "I don’t get it.",
        "Op, the ruined quiches are ready.",
        "Hey!",
        "This used to be your room? (She nods ‘Yes’) Wow! You must’ve been in really good shape as a kid.",
        "Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.",
        "No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we’ll call that pulling a Monica.",
        "Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A’s, his parents would say, \"Yeah, he pulled a Monica.\" Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, \"Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica.\" Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, \"Yeah, that one’s outta here.\" Though some things don’t change.",
        "Wow! My breasts are really strong. (She goes and joins Monica.)",
        "They’re not even touching the lasagna!",
        "Oh, they love your casserole.",
        "It’s hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.",
        "Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. (They both look at her) (to Monica) She doesn’t know we switched it. (Monica nods her head ‘No.’)",
        "Oh.",
        "Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.",
        "Ehh?",
        "I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!",
        "How close?",
        "I don’t even know how that would work!",
        "(interrupting) I’m not asking!",
        "Yeah. Let’s see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.",
        "Yeah, well, everybody does! I’m a really cool person. And y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn’t even try! Y'know what, you walked out on me, and I’m just, I’m gonna do the same thing to you.",
        "I don’t ever want to see you again! ",
        "(walking back in with her hand over her eyes.) Umm, where’s my purse?",
        "Well, umm, my Mom’s friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.",
        "Oh, my new Mom, who-who’s a big, fat abandoner! (starts to go upstairs)",
        "No. I’m just, I wanna, I need to be alone.",
        "(turning around, insistently) Monica!",
        "Well, I’m ready to get the hell out of here! (Sees Ross and Rachel cuddling on the couch.) Oh. Are you? Are you?!! (they nod ‘Yes.’) Ohh! That’s so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. (they nod ‘No.’) But for you, yay! Ohh.",
        "Okay, I’m gonna put this (her suitcase) in the car.",
        "(to the person that answered the door) Hi, Ursula.",
        "Okay, well umm, I know that we haven’t talked in a long time, but umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.",
        "(shocked) You know her?!",
        "There-there was a suicide note?! (Ursula nods ‘Yes.’) Well, do you still have it?",
        "I can’t believe you didn’t tell me there was a suicide note!",
        "I, umm, shut up!",
        "(reading from the note) “Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I’ll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk.” You just wrote this!",
        "Noooo!!",
        "No. I’m-I’m to depressed to talk.",
        "(singing) “...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm.” (applause) Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. (Sees that Phoebe Sr. has entered, and to her) Except for you. You go away.",
        "Okay, bye.",
        "No.",
        "But, it’s not like we’re losing anything. Y'know?",
        "It’s not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common.",
        "I-I like pizza!",
        "Oh my God, so do I!",
        "Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?",
        "Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I’m-I’m mad at you.",
        "Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I’m kinda hungry.",
        "All right, stop it. Now you’re just doing it to freak me out.",
        "Hey what are you guys looking at?",
        "Yeah, come to papa.",
        "Oo! Is it for my birthday present?",
        "Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?",
        "'Kay.",
        "Yeah, and what a great way to say, \"I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!\"",
        "It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!",
        "Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican... (Monica looks almost puzzled) ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?",
        "There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!",
        "Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.",
        "Yes, but I'm doing this.",
        "Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?",
        "Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.",
        "Mon! I'm so happy for you!",
        "I'll have one, please. Plus my money.",
        "Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank.",
        "Yes. Did you settle the bill?",
        "Oh, look what we almost left. (Picks up a coffee maker)",
        "Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!",
        "But Mon, you have to get our money!",
        "I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?",
        "Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, \"that massage wasn't long enough, or, \"I don't recognize any of those songs,\" or, you know, \"these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!\"",
        "Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.",
        "She seems fine now.",
        "You didn't get the money, did you?",
        "No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough! (Phoebe goes into the living room.) Hey, widow?",
        "Okay, Widow!",
        "Excuse me. Excuse me! (Mrs. Bukart stops singing) Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.",
        "Good. (Phoebe and Mrs. Burkart go into the other room, leaving Monica with everyone staring at her.)",
        "Uh... yay!",
        "Yeah. I'm a hard ass.",
        "Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!",
        "Okay!",
        "Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties!",
        "Thank you.",
        "(entering) Oh.",
        "(in a nasally voice, from her cold) But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. (She puts her shoe on the table, and it's horribly decorated) Pretty, huh? (Sneezes)",
        "Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People. (Starts to sing) Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you? (Stops singing) This chick sounds good. (Singing) Smelly cat, smelly--(stops singing) Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.",
        "(singing, drunk) My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey.",
        "It's fun, God I love how sexy I am. (Coughs really loudly.)",
        "Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.",
        "Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.",
        "So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.",
        "Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that \"Woo-hoo\" thing.",
        "Hey.",
        "Hi.",
        "Wow, cute one!",
        "Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour. Hey, (clears her voice and in her normal voice) you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. Ooh, (tries to sing) My sticky shoes--eww! Eww! I lost my sexy phlegm!",
        "Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common.",
        "What?!",
        "Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!",
        "You mean you stole it! (Monica sneezes again) Don't cover your mouth when you do that!",
        "(entering) Hi! It's me. And soup. (to Rachel) Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket.",
        "(to Monica) Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water.",
        "(picking up Monica's used Kleenex and putting some in her pocket.) Sure.",
        "But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.",
        "It's okay. How's the soup?",
        "(singing) Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street. Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats. (to Gunther) Does it even work without my sexy voice?",
        "Gunther, kiss me.",
        "(singing) And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.",
        "Look everyone, it’s the spirit of Thanksgiving!",
        "Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there’s the added mystery of who gets who.",
        "I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!",
        "Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it’s like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let’s trade!",
        "Ohh.",
        "You don’t have to do that, Ross and Joey aren’t here, you can watch the parade if you want.",
        "God, what happened?!",
        "Open it up, let me see.",
        "Ooh, God it looks bad.",
        "Honey, you’ve got to go. What’s his office number?",
        "(on phone) Hi! Yeah, I’m calling on behalf of Monica Geller’s eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. (Listens) (to Monica) He’s out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?",
        "Yes! She’s very excited about that.",
        "This is so cool, ‘til Monica gets back, it’s like I’m head chef and I get to make all the decisions. (She looks at the remaining butter, and then decides to add it to the dish.)",
        "Okay, get out of my kitchen!",
        "All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.",
        "Yeah, I can see where I’d be your best shot but, no. I’m sorry, but I think it’s twisted.",
        "Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, \"That’s not how your dad used to do it.\"",
        "Oh, I’ll get it. (goes over to the door.)",
        "Oh, he-he can’t talk right now.",
        "He’s just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.",
        "They were threefold.",
        "Oh, she sees him! Oh, they’re hugging!",
        "Oh, there they are!",
        "All right, get a room.",
        "Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?",
        "(singing) \"Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease…\" Darn it! Now, I don’t know who to get to the next verse.",
        "Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about ‘bah-bah-bha-bhan?’",
        "Oh yeah, that’s right, the keyboards, huh?",
        "I wanna hear \"The Sound.\"",
        "Come on, play that funky music white boy.",
        "Wow, it was so—wow!",
        "What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it’s just, it’s so different from the stuff you usually hear.",
        "(pushing Monica back onto the couch) It’s so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!",
        "Oh no, I’m not playing tonight.",
        "I can’t follow Ross! It’d be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.",
        "Oh my God, he’s not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!",
        "You guys. You suck too. (She hugs them both.)",
        "Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!",
        "Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Yeah, I-I can’t—I mean y’know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just—I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I…",
        "Oh no. No-no-no, don’t do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.",
        "Does Joey know?",
        "I think maybe, yeah.",
        "Yeah! No, that’s right. And I thought it was a really good idea.",
        "Oh my God, he’s lost it. He’s totally lost it.",
        "After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.",
        "Okay!",
        "Okayyyyy, open up!",
        "Yeah, it’s for our catering business!",
        "No, we’re gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette.",
        "And also, we don’t know what to do with this. (She turns on a switch and the girl’s nipples light up.)",
        "Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.",
        "How could you say yes, what about our catering business?",
        "Oh, in that case—(hops up and down in joy)—Yay! (Monica looks confused) That was me hopping on board.",
        "Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?",
        "Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.",
        "Oh, okay! (reading) \"Would I go back to Allesandro’s? Sure, but I’d have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head.\" (to Monica) Wow! You really laid into this place.",
        "Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.",
        "No-no, it’s okay. But are we sure we don’t want the waterbed?",
        "Yeah, all right. (starts to leave)",
        "Bye!",
        "(on intercom) Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go.",
        "Hey, Monica!",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Yeah.",
        "I don’t know, it would totally depend on her coloring and… (realizes) You got the job!!",
        "Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.",
        "But we’ve only had one job.",
        "Yeah! What are you saying?",
        "What?",
        "You’re the cook! With out you it’s just me driving up to people’s houses with empty trays and asking for money!",
        "For what? I can’t believe this! I gotta get out of here. (leaves)",
        "Okay, I’m hearing.",
        "What?!",
        "I wa-I wa-I wa…",
        "Monica!",
        "No.",
        "No.",
        "Really?! Are you sure?",
        "Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let’s plan the wedding reception. (She grabs the notebook which Monica used for her ideas and starts flipping page after page after page after page after page to find a blank one.) Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. (pause) Y’know what, I want you to take the chef job.",
        "Yeah. That’s what you really want. Yeah, I don’t want to be the reason you’re unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don’t want to be the reason I’m unhappy.",
        "Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.",
        "Hey!",
        "Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth. (Joey, with an obvious mouth full, nods yes.)",
        "Where were you?",
        "Oh, which museum?",
        "(just Phoebe) No, answer his.",
        "Umm, that paper’s two weeks old.",
        "What’s wrong Mon?",
        "Oh.",
        "Hey, maybe they meant to write, ‘Quiet, bitch.’",
        "Hey! You guys, I’m writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?",
        "(singing) Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey! Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel!",
        "Oh, yay!",
        "I know but it’s so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!",
        "All good, thanks. (to Rachel) Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that’s easier to rhyme?",
        "Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?",
        "(shocked) You work with robots!!",
        "No! No, the robots just work for them.",
        "If she’s no fun, why do you want to date her at all?",
        "Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?",
        "(singing) Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry…",
        "What?",
        "So! Ross doesn’t really decorate his tree with floss, but you don’t hear him complaining do you? God! (Phoebe hits her guitar which wakes up Ross with a start.)",
        "So, did you pick one yet?",
        "Well look, you don’t really like the one from uptown and you’re too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you’re done!",
        "Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.",
        "There’s sooo much you don’t know.",
        "(singing) \"Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap.\n                                Asked him to bring my friends all kind of crap.\n                                Said all you need is to write them a song.\n                                They haven't heard it, so don't try and sing along.\n                                No, don't sing along.",

        "Rachel has a new doll.",
        "Ooh, what do I smell?",
        "Ooh! (They all go over to her apartment)",
        "What? What?",
        "(getting up) Well, I hate to eat and run, but…",
        "Yeah, I don’t need it.",
        "Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?",
        "If you wanted to punish them, you should’ve just made them hang out here!",
        "Oh, are we gonna trash that place?",
        "Wait a minute.",
        "Why don’t you ask him out?",
        "He just got a divorce right?",
        "So he’s probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.",
        "(shocked) You’ve never asked a guy out?!!",
        "Thousands of times!! That doesn’t make me sound too good does it?",
        "Oh, please!",
        "I’ve never done that.",
        "No, sorry.",
        "Great!",

        "You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn’t be living in an apartment.",
        "All right. I’m gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I’m ready to have Frank and Alice’s embryo transferred into my uterus.",
        "Oh, they’re just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.",
        "Okay everyone, think thick.",
        "Hi! Wish me luck!",
        "Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.",
        "Embryossss? As in, \"More than one?\"",
        "Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?",
        "That’s it! 25 percent? That means that’s it’s like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!",
        "Okay, well y’know what, don’t worry you guys, ‘cause I’m-I’m gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.",
        "Whoa!! That—okay, that’s a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. (to Dr. Zane) So, well okay, so is there—is maybe is there something that I can do y’know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?",
        "Wow! You guys really don’t know anything!",
        "Hello, tiny embryos. Well, I’m-I’m Phoebe Buffay, hi! I’m-I’m-I’m hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months. You should know, that we’re doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, you’ve been there! Umm, y’know they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on. Okay, and-and I promise that I’ll keep you safe and warm until you’re ready to have them take you home, so… Oh! And also, umm next time you see me, I’m screaming, don’t worry, that’s what’s supposed to happen.",
        "Uh-huh. (To the embryos) Good luck.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Umm, yeah, uh-huh, they’re implanted.",
        "Well, freaked. ‘Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alice’s like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket.",
        "All right, I’m gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now.",
        "Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body’s always been a little faster than Western medicine.",
        "Nope, not knocked up yet.",
        "Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, I’m gonna do whatever I can to help this so, I’m just gonna y’know, lie it your chair, (She climbs into the chair and drapes her feet over the back of the chair.) Y'know? Yeah, good, I’m let gravity y’know, do its jobs.",
        "(singing) \"Are you in there little fetus?\n                             In nine will you come great us?\n                             I will buy you some Adidas.\"",
        "Oh. Oh.",
        "All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, y’know just remember that it’s still really early, okay so, if it says that I’m not pregnant, that doesn’t mean that I’m not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so I don’t go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.",
        "Great. (Goes to take the test.)",
        "You guys! You guys! You’re gonna have a baby! They’re gonna have a baby!",
        "Okay, but this can’t be good for the baby.",
        "(holding a lure) So now, what is this now?",
        "(laughs and picks up another lure) And this?",
        "(laughs harder) You make it so funny.",
        "Hey!",
        "I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.",
        "Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.",
        "Don’t you just love the way they talk?!",
        "Ohh!",
        "It kicked! I think the baby kicked!",
        "Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.",
        "Why?",
        "Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?",
        "(going over to comfort her) Aww, Pheebs.",
        "That’s short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!",
        "Shhh!! Please! What’s he saying?",
        "What? Oh my God!",
        "Well, look, why don’t you just, why don’t you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.",
        "Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!",
        "Y’know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!",
        "I’m sorry. (Goes and hugs him)",
        "Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, ‘cause I’m pregnant.",
        "Ha-ha, it’s not my baby, ha-ha-ha! (He leaves.)",
        "(doing the same) I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.",
        "Come on! Look where you are!!",
        "Remember, a virgin for me please.",
        "Well, if you think it will help.",
        "You should! How is she?",
        "Who, Josh?",
        "Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, y’know what, you were right, you were right. We really weren’t great at being guys, but you know why? Because we’re girls.",
        "And do you know what girls are really good at?",
        "No, listening! Sit! Y’know, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk.",
        "Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh! What is that? What is that?",
        "Hey—ooh so, how was Vermont?",
        "I-I wanna be with her, (points to the stripper next to her) I like her.",
        "Ohhh, wow.",
        "What?! I thought you were crazy about her!",
        "Yep!",
        "Oh my God, that’s so freaky! Turn him off!!",
        "Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.",
        "(whispering to Ross) Janice.",
        "Yeah, I know, I do that ‘cause it makes me look taller.",
        "Well, why are you doing this anyway?",
        "You’re kidding! And he plays rugby?! That’s so funny. (Realises) Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.",
        "(to the player) Hi.",
        "Whoa! (The player leaves and to Joey) I kinda liked it.",
        "No offence but, y’know sometimes it’s hard to understand you, y’know with the accent, so…",
        "Oh, poor baby.",
        "She’s right! You have to stop!",
        "Now, are you sure you don’t want to go see a doctor?",
        "Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice! (They go and get the coffee and the ice leaving Ross and Emily alone.)",
        "See? I’m doing it. I am totally doing it. (Suddenly it stops working.) I lost it.",
        "I-I can’t find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I’m telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake—ooh! Cake! (Chandler shrugs, and Phoebe grimaces.) No.",
        "God! Ooh! What is that smell? It’s coming from the bathroom. Ooh! (She goes to the bathroom.)",
        "It’s me. It’s Phoebe. Listen there’s something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?",
        "(she smells his head) No!",
        "Yes. Yes. Yes. I can’t believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can’t eat meat!",
        "(angered by the rubbing) Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y’know? And I got nauseous.",
        "Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.",
        "That’s sweat. You throw up all morning, you’ll have that glow too.",
        "Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?",
        "Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?",
        "Oooh, yeah. You’re a genius.",
        "Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!",
        "Y’know it doesn’t matter how much I’m craving it. Y’know why I’m never gonna eat meat? Because it’s murder, cold blooded murder.",
        "I can’t help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.",
        "Yeah, totally!",
        "Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I’m gonna eat like, y’know millions of cows.",
        "What?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Joey, I can’t believe you would do that for me.",
        "Pastrami.",
        "Okay.",
        "Six months.",
        "Not if I get there first.",
        "(entering, carrying her massage table) Hi!",
        "Yeah.",

        "You mean like a doctor?",
        "Ohh! (She moves.) Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN today.",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Why don’t take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I’ll hold onto your card, okay?",
        "Three? You guys were worried I wouldn’t even have one!",
        "Well, yeah.",
        "Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months I’m going to have three full grown babies just walkin’ around inside me?! Oh! Oh! And it’s gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!",
        "What do you know?!",
        "Ooh! Hi!",
        "Oh well, okay, hey, y’know how when you’re umm, you’re walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, \"Oh, that’s nice?\"",
        "Okay, yeah well, good news, you’re going to have three babies.",
        "Oh God, I’m so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.",
        "No, no maybe ‘cause it’s harder to raise them, and the added expense, and…",
        "No, back to happy. Back to happy!",
        "No you can’t quit college! No! You’re in college? Really?",
        "You can’t give up on your dream.",
        "Hey.",
        "Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you (Points to Chandler) about, ‘cause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.",
        "(entering carrying a case) Ooh, good, you’re hear! Okay.",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh this, well I’m glad you asked. (She opens the case and removes a knife and an soda can.) Now, don’t you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? (She efficiently cuts it in half.) Ahh! Now, I know what you’re thinking…",
        "No!",
        "No!",
        "No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.",
        "My Saturn dealership.",
        "Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I’m gonna open up my own massage place and Frank’s gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn’t have to quit school!",
        "I’m telling it! I’m telling it!",
        "Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I’ve got?",
        "No! Think about it, it’s a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it’s…",
        "The name was my favourite part!",
        "YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That’s not good.",
        "Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that’s better than Relaxi Cab.",
        "Oh, that is better.",
        "Hey!",
        "(not amused) Ha-ha. (She sits down on the couch.) No, it’s just I’m so pregnant that I—my guitar doesn’t fit anymore. So I thought ‘til I’m not, I’m just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!",
        "Listen. Listen. (She starts to play and sing.) Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?",
        "I know! I know, and I’ve only been playing for like an hour!",
        "Hey! What are you doing here?",
        "Oh, well, don’t tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.",
        "Wow! That’s so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.",
        "Hi!",
        "Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book (Holds up a book) and found nothing! I want a name that’s really like, y’know strong and confident, y’know? Like-like Exxon.",
        "No, I’m-I’m not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with \"The.\"",
        "Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. (They both stare at her.) But, all right, I don’t—maybe I’ll just name him The Hulk.",
        "God, Susan is so fun!",
        "Yeah, I definitely. I don’t like the name Ross.",
        "No! No! I-I meant for the baby!",
        "Well, it’s just y’know that something like this would never to like The Hulk, y’know…",
        "So, I decided I’m definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.",
        "Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it’s like y’know, Chanoey?",
        "All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?",
        "Umm, Gene.",
        "Bye, Gene.",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Wow, Carol really messed you up!",
        "Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant. (They all look at her.) All right, so I don’t know what sycophant means, but the rest is right.",
        "All right, all right, so up until ‘92-93 he was very trusting, then ’94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!",
        "Yeah. The ’92 Ross wouldn’t.",
        "Drum roll.",
        "You’re actually going through with this?",
        "You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact—yes, (To Joey) I’m, I’m sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I’m-I’m, I’m gonna, I’m gonna name the baby Chandler.",
        "Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!",
        "Okay!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yay!",
        "Yay—oh—yay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!",
        "Ooh, uh… (She grabs her coat and runs out.)",
        "Okay, bye!",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, the Olympics.",
        "I still cannot believe you’re engaged! (Ross looks at her) Just ‘cause its happening so fast; not ‘cause you’re such a loser.",
        "Already?!",
        "Yeah, but y’know, about have of these are gonna end up getting divorced.",
        "You’re the most beautiful bride I’ve ever seen.",

        "Yeah!",
        "No, you have to let me in right now!!",
        "Yes!",
        "Yeah.",

        "Thank you!",
        "Okay! (Gets into position) Okay, ready?",
        "Okay. (Phoebe turns and throws it on the couch.)",
        "I’m not gonna right to you! That’s not real!",
        "Yeah, I think we are.",
        "Well, at least you didn’t rent yours from a store called, \"It’s Not Too Late.\"",
        "Me too.",
        "Me too.",
        "Okay.",
        "Yay!",
        "I hate my regular clothes now! Y’know? I look down and-and I know that this isn’t gonna be the most special day of my life.",
        "I guess.",

        "Oh, you’re such a cheater!",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, how’d that happen?",
        "What is that?",
        "Oh, how did it go?",
        "What did he say?",
        "Yeah, maybe.",
        "Any luck?",
        "(looks at Monica) Hey, y’know what might cheer you up?",
        "No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!",
        "Not after this!",
        "(entering, wearing Santa pants) Hello!",
        "Excuse me.",
        "Oh, yeah! You like ‘em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!",
        "What?",
        "Nuh-uh! They’re maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby names. (Pulls out a sheet of paper which lists who’s been naughty and who’s been nice.) See, these names are good, and these names are bad. (Finally, she figures it out.) Ohh.",
        "I don’t know! How are the-the-the-the, y’know—You’re clothes aren’t funny.",
        "Boy! I didn’t see that coming!",
        "That’s too hard. Too hard!",
        "Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?",
        "Or you could end up with everything.",
        "Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?",
        "Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh—oh, I have a game!",
        "This is great!",
        "Oh, well, it doesn’t have a name—oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it doesn’t have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?",
        "Good! Good! Five points!",
        "All right, Joey, same question.",
        "Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy, leafy.",
        "Oh, I have cards!",
        "Yeah! Here! (She grabs a deck out of her purse) Oh no, these are the trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.",
        "What make you think I can?! (Shields her eyes from it.)",
        "I don’t know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! (She fans out the trick deck.) Ah-ha!",
        "(opening the door) I had nothing to do with it. (Closes the door.) (Opens the door.) Okay, it was my idea, but I don’t feel good about it.",
        "That’s so funny to think if you’d just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.",
        "Okay, scarf’s done. (It’s not really a scarf, it’s just a bunch of yarn that Phoebe has tied together. Just then, Ross and Emily enter dragging with them Joey and Chandler.)",
        "Hey!",
        "What? Oh, are you pregnant too?!",
        "(angrily) That’s like the tenth time I’ve peed since I’ve been here!",
        "Yeah, oh I’m sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya, it’s a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I’m so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, ‘cause—Oh! I’m pregnant!",
        "(starting to cry) Thank you so much.",
        "I haven’t really had any yet.",
        "(to her babies) Stop it!",
        "One of the babies is kicking.",
        "It’s not kicking me, it’s kicking one of the other babies. Oh (looks down her dress)! Don’t make me come in there!",
        "Hey!! Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!! (Joey walks back in, scared.)",
        "I can’t believe I’m gonna have a party! This is so great! (Really excited) A party! (Really, really excited) Yay!! (Suddenly, she starts crying and Rachel moves to comfort her.) I don’t know why.",
        "What the hell is this?! What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can’t use for another two months?! This sucks! All right, what’s my next present?!",
        "Hi, guys.",
        "I-I wanted to apologise if I—y’know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y’know it’s just the hormones, y’know.",
        "Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet. (She goes to hug them and they both flinch, thinking that Phoebe is about to attack them.)",
        "Good. Y’know—no-no, okay, it’s-it feels like everything’s been about me lately, so what’s happening with you?",
        "Oh!",
        "Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.",
        "Well, let’s see, it’s not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y’know a bunch of y’know high school crap that nobody really gives y’know…",
        "Alrighty, here come the water works. (Rachel starts crying harder.)",
        "(sips it) It’s so good. (Monica and Rachel breath a sigh of relief.) Oh, thanks.",
        "(sets the cup down) Oh! (Grabs her stomach in pain.)",
        "Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.",
        "Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one.",
        "No. It’s all right; it’s probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.",
        "Well, do you see any babies?",
        "Okay, I guess. I mean… I don’t know, it’s just, I guess I know it’s going to be over soon.",
        "I know. It’s just y’know usually when you’re, when you’re done with the pregnant thing, y’know, then you get to do the mom thing. I’m gonna be y’know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.",
        "Okay that’s even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it’s just that now that they’re in me it’s like, it’s like I know them y’know, I mean-I mean, it’s just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.",
        "Yeah, okay.",
        "Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!",
        "They are gonna love me.",
        "Thanks you guys! Again.",
        "You’re the best. Thanks. Oh!",
        "Just kidding. Ahh!",
        "Got cha again, you guys are so easy.",
        "(On the phone, in New York) Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller’s personal physician, Dr. Philange.",
        "Yeah, I’ve discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women’s names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.",
        "No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!",
        "Hello?",
        "Hi, so what happened?",
        "Yeah, I know, but I don’t think that means anything.",
        "Hey!",
        "(To Joey) You ate meat! (Joey is shocked) (To Chandler and Monica) You had s*x! (They’re shocked.)",
        "I know you didn’t, I was talking about Monica.",
        "This pregnancy is throwing me all off.",
        "Oh, me too!",
        "Oh right, maybe I’ll just go home.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "What-what’s up?",
        "Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y’know you can die. And, you would die!",
        "So you guys’ll stay here and hang out with me?",
        "[singing] I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...",
        "Oooh look! Isn’t this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine!",
        "Hey! Hey, did you get your invitation to Ross’s wedding?",
        "I’m so jealous you’re all going! I can’t believe I never knew that you can’t fly in your third trimester!",
        "Remembered what?",
        "Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.",
        "See, he's her lobster.",
        "Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.",
        "Okay, okay, but Rachel’s gonna be here too, can’t I just ask her this stuff?",
        "Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your wedding, but I don’t—can’t get up.",
        "Great! Yeah, could you bring me the newspaper?",
        "Oh, have a great wedding!",
        "Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!",
        "Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, it’s on the counter in your apartment.",
        "(laughs) Thank you.",
        "Thank you. (She pats him on his head.)",
        "Oh, do you need a hug? You don’t have to bring me anything!",
        "Oh. Oh.",
        "Oh, no. Oh, nothing.",
        "Okay, I have a wedgie.",
        "So-so, what do you want for lunch?",
        "Yeah, I do. What’s the matter?",
        "Eh, don’t be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married…",
        "Yeah!",
        "Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.",
        "We thought you knew!",
        "Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!",
        "Oh no, Ross doesn’t know anything.",
        "Well, because we thought you knew!! It’s so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, \"Hey, you like things clean.\"",
        "Hey!",
        "So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?",
        "Well, I think I can help you get over him.",
        "Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.",
        "And a small piece of chocolate.",
        "And a glass of tepid water. (She gathers up all of these things.)",
        "Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn’t feel like getting up. Okay, I’m gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you’re going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.",
        "Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he’s such a great guy. Here. (Hands her the picture, Rachel grabs it out of her hand.) Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you’re with Ross okay and imagine that you’re kissing him. And you’re-you’re running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it’s some kind of grease, it’s—uck! Hah?",
        "Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let’s try some uh, aversion therapy.",
        "Okay?",
        "So uh, now look at the picture…",
        "All right, and umm… (She grabs the picture and smacks her in the head.)",
        "Okay, how do you feel now?",
        "Hello.",
        "Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the—that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say ‘hi!’ but then I figured, he doesn’t care if he looks like you.",
        "Ohh, they’re having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn’t been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?",
        "So you’re not homesick yet?",
        "All right, the seven of us miss you.",
        "Y’know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies…",
        "Ooh, the pizza guy’s here!",
        "Yeah. But y’know we were thinking about you, y’know we ordered the Joey Special.",
        "Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Yeah, it’s in the guys’ apartment under the sink. Why?",
        "What?! What do you mean you’re going to London?",
        "I—Rachel, you can’t go! Ross loves Emily!",
        "That’s not why you’re going! You’re going because you hope he’s gonna say, \"Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy.\"",
        "No! Because he’s in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you’re just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y’know, it’s too late! You missed you’re chance! I’m sorry, I know this must be really hard, it’s over.",
        "I do! I do! I do! (Chases her into the hall, but Rachel doesn’t stop.) I do! (Gives up.) Ugh, like I can really chase you. I’m carrying a litter.",
        "Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily’s Parents’ house.",
        "(In a British accent) This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it’s not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?",
        "No no no, I’ll be nice, I swear!!!   Could you just give me the number for where they are?",
        "Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if you don’t give me that number then I’m going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.",
        "Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass.",
        "(Looking relieved. She puts down the phone.) Oh thank god. Oh, you changed your mind. Oh, look I know you probably want to be alone, and you don’t want to talk about it, that’s fine. I just want you to know, I think you are doing the right thing and...",
        "(Trying to get up.) Wait!! Where are you going?! What are you doing?! No!! Wait!! (Not able to get up.) God!! Why am I always pregnant when she does that?!",
        "Oh, hi, Mrs. Waltham. I need to speak with ether one of the best men, or Ross’s sister Monica.",
        "Oh, I’m Phoebe Buffay. I’m one of Ross’s best friends.",
        "Yeah, um, I can’t fly. I’m having my brother’s babies.",
        "No..umm, could I talk to one of them? It’s very very important.",
        "Ohh! Okay, I’m going to have to kick her ass too.",
        "(Angrily.) Hey, were the hell have you been?!",
        "I don’t want to hear about her!!",
        "No! No, we have an emergency. Okay? Rachel’s coming to London.",
        "No it’s not great. No, she’s coming to tell Ross that she loves him.",
        "I KNOW THAT!!! You have to stop her!! She’s going to ruin the wedding!!",
        "All right, so, okay...",
        "Okay, so I’m done my part, okay. It’s your responsibility now, okay. The burden is off me, right?",
        "So tell me about this girl?",
        "Mrs. Waltham. Hi. It’s Phoebe again.",
        "Yea. Can I please, please, please talk to one of the best men? This is going to be the last time I promise.",
        "Did you stop Rachel?",
        "So nothing got ruined?",
        "Oh that’s so great! Ohh, so what’s going on now?",
        "No!! wait, wait, wait!! Oh please, hold it up so I can listen. (Joey looks at Ross and holds the phone above Ross’s shoulder.)",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this driver…",
        "What?",
        "Oh. Ha-ha-ha. All right, anyway…",
        "Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat--I don't want to talk about it.",
        "So you still hadn't heard from Emily?",
        "London is stupid! Stupid!",
        "Oh… No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "(Grabs the pictures) Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me. (She picks up a magic marker and draws herself in. Monica can't watch.)",
        "No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.",
        "Well, it felt French.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!",
        "(excited) Central…(not so excited) Park!",
        "That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? \"Well, it's right by my house, all right!\"",
        "That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.",
        "Okay, woo! Hi.",
        "Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?",
        "Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!",
        "Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for rolling bones!",
        "All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun! (She starts out the door.)",
        "Wait, wait, remember when my water broke? (They all high-five again.)",
        "(to the nurse) Hi.",
        "Hi, yeah, hi! I'm umm, Phoebe Buffay, and I have babies coming out of me.",
        "Not yet. Umm, I heard they really hurt, do they hurt?",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Oh no, none of them are the father. The father is my brother.",
        "Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me!",
        "(standing up) Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice. (As she is talking Joey is sticking the camera under her skirt.) And then my mom wants to know-(notices Joey)-Joey, what are you doing?!",
        "What?!",
        "Oh my God, she's so stupid!",
        "That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your v*g1n*!",
        "All right--Ooh! Oh dead God, save me!",
        "I'm having my first contraction!",
        "Ooh, it's not bad.",
        "Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!",
        "No-no-no! We haven't started yet. Where's Alice?",
        "Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either--Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! (Checks under the blanket.) Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.",
        "Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder.",
        "Hey.",
        "It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!",
        "(interrupting) What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!",
        "Hi! And you're going into what grade?",
        "(interrupting) Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor.",
        "Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!",
        "They are. Why?",
        "Happy birthday!",
        "I know, it is.",
        "Can I tell you a little secret?",
        "I want to keep one. (Giggles in excitement.)",
        "Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!",
        "Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?",
        "Oh, just ask him!",
        "I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out!",
        "You're right.",
        "Tell him it's for you.",
        "(To Rachel) So did you ask him?",
        "Well, I'm kinda on a clock here.",
        "Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.",
        "Hi!",
        "Okay, doctor says any minute now.",
        "Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.",
        "Oo, this is a big one. Eww! Arghhhh!!",
        "What is that?",
        "Oh my God!",
        "I already had a baby. Leave me alone.",
        "Which one do you have?",
        "But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know…",
        "Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies.",
        "So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little high fives! (Imitates the high fives.) Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! (One of the babies begins to cry.) Well, if you're gonna cry. (She starts crying.)",
        "I know.",
        "Yeah. You won't be able to take it.",
        "They're gonna call her Chandler.",
        "Works on you.",
        "Ugh, PBS!",
        "Ugh, what's right with them?",
        "Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.",
        "All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!",
        "This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.",
        "What-what are you talking about?!",
        "Yeah. So?",
        "Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.",
        "Yeah, it's… Y'know there's—no you may not!",
        "Are you calling me selfish?!",
        "I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.",
        "Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?",
        "Right. (She turns and opens her eyes in shock.)",
        "I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!",
        "I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!",
        "Ooh-ohh!",
        "Why?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.",
        "(on phone from Central Perk) Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.",
        "Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.",
        "(Thinks for a moment.) Aw, dammit! (Slams the phone down.)",
        "Ooh, it's not a toy.",
        "(on phone) Hi Joey.",
        "I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.",
        "Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.",
        "No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.",
        "Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.",
        "Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel—Oh no! (Realizes that her deed made her happy and therefore it's selfish and covers her mouth in horror.)",
        "Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!",
        "Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?",
        "Yeah that's better than my way.",
        "(To Chandler) Can you hear anything?",
        "Ooh, Madlibs, mine! (Grabs it.)",
        "I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.",
        "Yeah, me either.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.",
        "Ehh!!",
        "Come where?",
        "Okay, but try and get Joey too.",
        "Oh, sure! (She gets up to leave.) Bye Ross! (Whispering behind his back.) Forever.",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.",
        "We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!",
        "The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, \"Hi, Phoebe!\"",
        "Count for what?",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.",
        "Eeeee-(She opens the box and removes its contents and sees that it's a fur coat.)-ohh!! God! (She throws it at Joey.)",
        "Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!",
        "Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.",
        "Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.",
        "I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.",
        "That might work! (She gives him the coat.)",
        "Why?",
        "Hey!",
        "So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?",
        "He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.",
        "This is fashion?! (Grabs the coat from Rachel.) Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. (She puts the coat on and starts to model it.) Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? (Sees herself in the mirror.) 'Cause I do.",
        "Nooo!!",
        "I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.",
        "Oh, I know.",
        "All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places. (She puts on her fur coat.)",
        "Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I—it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! (She starts to leave but stops and says to Monica.) Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!",
        "Are you still mad at us?",
        "Oh good! Because we have an \"I'm sorry\" song.",
        "(To Chandler) You're kinda stepping on the song. (She gets ready to play but is stopped by…)",
        "Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!",
        "Yes! Exactly! And that's why…",
        "Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!",
        "Oh God, I really missed that fat b*st*rd!",
        "Hi Emily!",
        "Here. (She wraps her coat around his shoulders.)",
        "(to the squirrel) Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they're mean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be coats! (The squirrel stares at her.) All right, fine, now I get it. (To the clerk.) Here. (She hands him her coat.) You take it. (To the squirrel.) Are you happy now? I'm cold!",
        "Does anyone wanna watch TV?",
        "Monica your remote doesn't work.",
        "Oh. Aw, forget it.",
        "Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.",
        "I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.",
        "Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's worse!",
        "More bandages! More bandages! Please, can I get some more bandages in here! This man is dying—(She is cut off by an exploding shell just outside the tent. When the smoke clears, she's missing an arm and the blood is pumping out like you'd see in a horror movie. And upon seeing her condition, she says…) Oh no.",
        "Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.",
        "Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.",
        "Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!",
        "(surprised) Hello?",
        "Joey? What's going on?",
        "Oh my God!",
        "(walks him to the kitchen) Easy. Step. How did it get on?",
        "Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!",
        "Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal.",
        "Hey!",
        "No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary.",
        "All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.",
        "Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?",
        "Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.",
        "Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!",
        "Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever.",
        " Gauze! Gauze! I need to get some gauze in here! Can I please get some gauze in here! (A shell explodes outside next to the tent and when the smoke clears, Phoebe still has her arm.) Whew! (Her arm falls off and starts pumping out blood.) This is getting ridiculous uh!",
        "Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?",
        "It's okay to laugh right?",
        "Okay. (She laughs harder.)",
        "Yum-my!",
        "Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.",
        "Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. (To Larry) Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!",
        "Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.",
        "Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat.",
        "Okay.",
        "He's so funny! (She imitates what he just did.)",
        "(smiles) Show me the badge again.",
        "Shiny.",
        "(laughing) You are just nonstop!",
        "Why?!",
        "(awed) You have the power to do that?",
        "(excited) Shut it down.",
        "Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!",
        "Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, \"See you ladle.\" (Laughs.)",
        "Ooh, absolutely!",
        "Ooh, I love that place! (Thinks about it.) So, no.",
        "Enh. Sure!",
        "Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That—this milk is mine. I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. (She takes a swig of it, but has to turn away from him as she makes a face to show that it has gone bad.) Okay, let's go!",
        "Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?",
        "Thank you. (To Gunther, who's standing there frozen) Okay, go! Go! Go! (He runs off.) (To Larry) Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.",
        "What am I sitting on?",
        "(taking something out of the couch) Ew-eww!! Undies!",
        "Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.",
        "Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam.",
        "Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I'd have someone to sit with!",
        "Yeah! Okay—ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?",
        "This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish.",
        "Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.",
        "Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff. (Writes him a note and the gang reads it.)",
        "Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.",
        "Well, he stabbed me first!!",
        "Okay.",
        "I thought you said you read it in high school.",
        "Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.",
        "(To Rachel) You completely stole my answer!",
        "Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!",
        "I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.",
        "Would you care to venture one?",
        "Are you just repeating what I'm saying?",
        "Okay then.",
        "Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!",
        "Yeah?",
        "Hi!",
        "You didn't read this one either?!",
        "What?",
        "No! You should've read it yourself!",
        "Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg.",
        "Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.",
        "Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.",
        "(smiling) I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.",
        "Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.",
        "Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.",
        "All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!",
        "What's going on?",
        "So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.",
        "I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.",
        "I don't know! I didn't come with her!",
        "Hey you guys, guess what?",
        "Ohh, you and your ways. (She shakes the bell at him and sits down.) Since it’s Christmastime. I’m going to be one of those people collection donations.",
        "(Excitedly) Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my bucket.",
        "Yeah, yeah, I’m going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I’m going to do the whole city.",
        "Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I’m the only one who can sing \"Merry Christmas\" in 25 languages. (She smirks.) I lied.",
        "Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo, and Merry Christmas. (A man put some change in her bucket.) Ohh thank you sir. Here's some joy. (She waves her hand up and down as if she is spreading joy.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Well, it's going okay.",
        "Oh, thanks!",
        "Wow!",
        "Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive.",
        "Just get your nails done?",
        "Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays, here's your joy. (She waves her arm and spreads her joy.)",
        "Thank you! And Happy Holidays.",
        "Wait, you can't take the money out.",
        "But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.",
        "Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still…",
        "Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just… (She scowls at him.)",
        "Thank you, Happy Holidays.",
        "Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't… (The lady ignores her and walks off.) Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!",
        "Hey!! (The bucket starts smoking.) The charity's on fire! Help! (Yet another guy walks by carrying a cup, which Phoebe grabs.) Oh good! Thank you, I need that. (She throws onto the smoldering fire. Suddenly the bucket erupts in flames.) Whoa! What is that?! (She sniffs the cup.) (To the guy.) It's nine o'clock in the morning!",
        "Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here! Look! (Hands it to Monica.) Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?",
        "Does it look like an ashtray?",
        "Does it look like a urinal?",
        "Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!",
        "Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'know what? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys. Sorry. (Leaves.)",
        "Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look. (The lady opens up her hand.) Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. (She throws the lint away.) What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here! (The lady walks away.)",
        "Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution! (The guy starts to walk away with a hurt look on his face.) And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! (Her boss and a co-worker walk up.) Hi Bob! (The same old lady from before walks bye.) (To the old lady.) I thought I told you to get outta here!",
        "What?!",
        "That chick can't handle my corner.",
        "Fine. (She hands her bell to Ginger and starts to take down her signs.) (The same old lady walks by again.) All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch. (The old lady.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?",
        "Exactly! Because it's in the past!",
        "Okay, then what happened?",
        "(gasps) Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. (The chick clucks.) You'll get your turn!",
        "Nothing! (Picks up and sets the chick down on the floor.) (To the chick.) This is not over!",
        "What?!",
        "Hey!",
        "What were you doing?",
        "Oh, nobody's judging you. (They all turn and look at Ross.)",
        "You two will have very hairy children.",
        "So are you actually gonna see her again?",
        "Uh-hmm.",
        "Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!",
        "Ohhh.",
        "Hey!",
        "Are you serious?!",
        "You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We…",
        "(turning from Ross.) No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!",
        "Ohh, tough call.",
        "Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the hospital.",
        "Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.",
        "It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.",
        "Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse!",
        "It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins.",
        "Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.",
        "It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; \"Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter.\" And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.",
        "It's Phoebe.",
        "Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?",
        "Umm, well, umm Grandma died.",
        "No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow.",
        "No you didn't!",
        "Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?",
        "Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert. (Starts to leave.)",
        "Well hello, Mrs. Penella! Thank you so much for coming! Well, okay look, here's your umm, 3-D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on.",
        "(notices his bag.) Hey, y'know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag!",
        "Thanks!",
        "Yeah, welcome.",
        "Umm here's your 3-D glasses.",
        "So how did you know Francis?",
        "Really?! What's your name?",
        "You're Frank Buffay?",
        "You just said…",
        "But…",
        "Oh my God!",
        "That was my dad!",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "He said, \"Nice to meet you Glenda.\" (They stare at her, dumbfounded) Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?",
        "Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!",
        "Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.",
        "All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.",
        "All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.",
        "Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out",
        "Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.",
        "All right.",
        "Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!",
        "As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!",
        "(seeing the look on Chandler's face) He-he does not like it! He hates it! He's in pain!",
        "Umm, thank you for meeting with me.",
        "Come, sit. (He's hesitant.) Sit. (Still hesitating.) Sit! (He sits on the arm of the couch.) Umm, all righty, before we get started I just—I need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.",
        "Okay.",
        "Huh?",
        "Oh yes. Yes. Yeah—no. She did. She left you umm, (looking in her purse) this lipstick.",
        "Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my official forms. (She picks up a couple of crumpled receipts.) Okay, so, question 1) You and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?",
        "Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium, or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?",
        "Yeah. See? (Quickly shows him.)",
        "Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A. Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man?",
        "What?!",
        "But you-you-you came to see Lilly?",
        "Lilly's dead. (He looks up in shock.)",
        "She's dead.",
        "Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake.",
        "17 years ago.",
        "Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe, (pause) is on this couch.",
        "Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!",
        "Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there.",
        "Y'know what, it doesn’t matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go.",
        "That's a defense?",
        "You make up songs?",
        "Well, I am. (Moves over and takes his hand.)",
        "Not yet, no. (Drops his hand and moves back.)",
        "It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?",
        "You too!",
        "Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.",
        "Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.",
        "Really?! How come?",
        "Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.",
        "Well, I taught me and I love me.",
        "Hey!",
        "Hornswoggle? (To Chandler) Ooh, this must be killing you.",
        "Okay. (Joey tries to take the guitar.) Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here, (Points to her head.) then you learn here. (Points to the guitar.)",
        "Okay, lesson one: chords. Now, I don't know the actual names of the chords but umm, I-I-I made up names for the way my hand looks while I'm doing them. (She starts to show Joey the chords. Transcribers Note: For this one you'll have to use your imagination, 'cause it would take me 50 pages to describe each one. So if you want to see them, you'll have to wait for this episode to come to a TV near you.) (Holding up her hand and then reconfiguring her hand with each name.) So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady. (Joey tries to imitate them.)",
        "Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.",
        "Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady! (They both laugh at what she said.)",
        "Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?!",
        "Give me your hands. (He does and she smells his left hand.) Strings. Gimme it! (He gives her his right hand and she smells it as well.) Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?",
        "Then don't touch one!!",
        "Tiger! (Joey moves his hand in an attempt to do the chord, in fact he does it with each name.) Dragon! Iceberg!! (He fails.) Joseph, did you even study at all last night?",
        "Then do Iceberg!",
        "G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords? (Joey doesn't answer.) Have you? (He looks away in shame.) Oh my God!",
        "No, but you're questioning my method!",
        "Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.",
        "Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!",
        "Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!",
        "Oh, fine! Take his side! (Storms out.)",
        "No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!",
        "Uh-huh!",
        "No!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.",
        "Bye! (She exits, leaving Rachel and Joey alone.)",
        "Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So…",
        "That's weird. (Pause.) I bet they're doing it.",
        "(looking out the window) Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!",
        "It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.",
        "(looking out the window) Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! (Starts yelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothes off.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!",
        "(screaming) Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!",
        "CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!",
        "OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!",
        "NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!",
        "YOU KNOW?!!!",
        "(Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her and Rachel.)",
        "You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or—Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!",
        "Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better.",
        "Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?",
        "Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.",
        "Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.",
        "No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!",
        "Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.",
        "And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.",
        "Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.",
        "Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!",
        "(feels his arm) Yeah the material feels so soft—hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?",
        "Well, if you really wanna know, I'm—Oh! I can't tell you this.",
        "Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.",
        "I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don’t even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee—Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just something to think about. I know I will.",
        "I have quarters! (She holds up a bag of quarters.)",
        "But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?",
        "Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She pinches his butt.)",
        "Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?",
        "He broke that.",
        "I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.",
        "(in a sexy voice) Oh? (Takes the phone from Rachel.) Hello you.",
        "Eh?",
        "Really?",
        "I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!",
        "No!",
        "God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey, you can't say anything!",
        "All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in.",
        "(laughs) Please.",
        "So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight.",
        "Oh absolutely. Shall we say, around seven?",
        "Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.",
        "Okay, Rachel, get me perfume!",
        "And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses? (He begrudgingly does so.)",
        "Okay.",
        "Good idea!",
        "Oh now, don't give away the farm!",
        "Chandler.",
        "I was going too. (They go inside and he closes the door.) Umm, I brought some wine. Would you like some?",
        "So, here we are. Nervous?",
        "No, I want this to happen.",
        "Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you. (She starts doing a rather suggestive and seductive dance that's silly at the same time.)",
        "Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!",
        "Really?",
        "No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.",
        "He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.",
        "Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you didn’t rip off any buttons.",
        "Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is showcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra.",
        "You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now.",
        "Ooh.",
        "Here it comes. Our first kiss.",
        "And why not?!",
        "You're-you're what?!",
        "I just—I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!",
        "God! (She turns and buttons up.)",
        "Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything.",
        "Hey! I brought you some house warming gifts.",
        "Yeah. Salt, so your life always has flavor.",
        "Bread, so you never go hungry.",
        "And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Mr. President.",
        "Yeah. I really like his glasses.",
        "Oh, hi Ross!",
        "Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it’s a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man! (A guest walks up to her.)",
        "Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.",
        "Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.",
        "No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah, okay, my bad.",
        "(ignoring him and continuing her conversation) That's what I'm saying. (Laughs.)",
        "Ooh. (Turns to him.)",
        "No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?",
        "Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.",
        "But somehow you came off as the bad guy.",
        "Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.",
        "Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!",
        "All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? (Ross is the only one who raises his hand and Phoebe glares at him to put his hand back down.) Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, \"Who hear likes Ross,\" and he's wearing two nametags! (He takes one off.) I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys (She turns to an elderly gentleman and a 20 something woman, who're a couple.) (To the girl) Gold-digger, (To the old guy) cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.",
        "Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.",
        "Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.",
        "What are you talking about?!",
        "Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.",
        "Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.",
        "Okay, great so do you want to do it together?",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?",
        "Oh good!",
        "Oh good.",
        "Oh wait, I change my mind! (She slams the door on them.) Okay, let's talk about the party! I have so many ideas! (Holds up a cocktail napkin.)",
        "Oh, look at that.",
        "What happened to the intimate dinner party?",
        "So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.",
        "Like what?",
        "Cups? You're giving me cups?",
        "Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? (Thinks of something) All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!",
        "I got it! Mine!",
        "(entering, carrying two garbage bags) Hey!",
        "Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?",
        "Umm, cups.",
        "Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.",
        "Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. (She goes and opens the door to Joey.) Oh, hi Joey!",
        "(To Chandler) Check it out! Cup hat! (Points to her hat.) Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup! (Holds up one.)",
        "(following him) And did you notice the ice? (Gestures to 3 huge buckets of ice on the table.) Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! (Pours some water onto the dry ice, causing it to evaporate/smoke.) Ahhh! Mystical!",
        "(noticing her) Oh, look! Look! Look!",
        "I was in charge of cups.",
        "All right. Hold on. (She starts digging in the chair.) I got it. Nickel! (Donates it.) How much more do we need?",
        "Okay, dime! (Donates that.) You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. (Finds something else.) Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! (Looks at it.) Oh my God, this is a police badge!",
        "Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year! (She crosses her fingers in hope.)",
        "Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?",
        "You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!",
        "No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.",
        "Hold it! (Grabs the badge) N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!",
        "Yeah that's right you are so busted. (To no one in particular.) Book 'em.",
        "Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.",
        "You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. (The woman calls her bluff.) (Screaming at no one in particular) Backup! Backup!!",
        "Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!",
        "…so this guy was all (Mumbles.) And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide. (Flashes the badge.) It was just so cool!",
        "I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.",
        "You could get arrested, right now! (Flashes the badge and they glare at her.) All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power. (She heads for the door just as Joey enters.)",
        "(To Joey) Hey.",
        "Excuse me, is this your car?",
        "Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance.",
        "Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop. (Shows the badge.)",
        "Ohh, no. (Pause) Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4. (Tries to leave.)",
        "I-I'm with the umm, the 57th.",
        "I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.",
        "Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?",
        "Yeah, big guy, kinda bald.",
        "(starts to walk away, but stops) Don’t try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died.",
        "I-I sure will, take care. (Starts walking off.)",
        "Oh. (She starts laughing. Then she throws the badge at him and runs away.)",
        "Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!",
        "Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you (Points at all of them) with me. (They all look at her.) Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck Chandler. (She opens the door to the cop from before.) Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But you'll never make it stick and you know it!",
        "Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!",
        "I would love it if I weren't here!",
        "Me?!",
        "Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out!",
        "Umm, yeah, I'd like to go out with you officer…",
        "Gary.",
        "Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find me?",
        "Ohh, impressive.",
        "Yeah, we'll talk at dinner.",
        "All right, I can't wait!",
        "Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it!",
        "You wanna work on your interview skills?",
        "Okay! All right, let's start with the handshake. Hi.",
        "Very good handshake, good wrist action.",
        "Okay. (They shake hands and she pulls away suddenly) Oh my God! What did I ever do to you?! (Rubbing her hand.)",
        "Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler.",
        "But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause some guy shot at a store clerk.",
        "Okay, then maybe I can come too!",
        "All right, you go. (They kiss.)",
        "'Kay, bye!",
        "Oh God!",
        "Oh I just miss him so much!",
        "Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this little puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just love beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each other.",
        "So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?",
        "Come on, seriously! When did it end?",
        "Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.",
        "(Under her breath) God, I woke the beast. Sorry. (To Monica) I was wrong obviously, I just—I misspoke. It's okay.",
        "Oh we can't, we already have plans.",
        "Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie.",
        "You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?",
        "Yeah!",
        "You tired Chandler?",
        "Ohh, (laughs) umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.",
        "We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!",
        "I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?",
        "Don't get me started on that.",
        "Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.",
        "(looking through the pizzas) Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!",
        "See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.",
        "This is so cool!",
        "But I like it here!",
        "Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them.",
        "Okay! (Walks over to Rachel) Rach, hi, I need those earrings you borrowed.",
        "I guess so. (See, the brief possession didn't affect her at all, like we could really tell.)",
        "Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?",
        "Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!",
        "Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!",
        "These are her earrings.",
        "Why not?",
        "(entering from Rachel's bedroom) I found it!",
        "On your dresser.",
        "(smiling) Maybe your scene's coming up?",
        "(smiling) This is terrible, what are you going to do?",
        "(not smiling) That's not good.",
        "But I already gave them back to you!",
        "All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said. (Walks away over to Rachel.) Where is that other earring?",
        "Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.",
        "Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!",
        "(she just looks at him) Why are you being weird?",
        "No, that would be, \"Why are you being cute?\"",
        "Ohh! I did not get that.",
        "Did you find it?",
        "Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.",
        "(To Rachel) What are we going to do?!",
        "All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all.",
        "I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.",
        "Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?",
        "Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!",
        "I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.",
        "No.",
        "Yeah! You're the best!",
        "Oh, right! (Hands Monica back her sunglasses.)",
        "I-I-I found it interesting.",
        "(walking over to Ross) Ross?",
        "What else do they add smell too?",
        "Oh no!",
        "I am definitely gonna watch that!",
        "Definitely!",
        "Oh, then no.",
        "(entering, with Gary) Hey!",
        "Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes.",
        "Uh-huh!",
        "(excited) John Glenn is here?!",
        "Hi!",
        "My God, Joey!",
        "Yeah! Sure! Yep! (Gets up) Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.",
        "Okay!",
        "Bye!",
        "Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.",
        "Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way. (Gets up) But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. (Starts to leave.) (To Joey) Not you Joey.",
        "Ohh, give him a kiss for me!",
        "Bye!",
        "(after he's gone) I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I didn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!",
        "I'm trying, but man that guy can push my buttons!",
        "Look, I don't wanna talk about it. Okay?",
        "You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by the way?",
        "Uh, it's a piece of paper and it says, \"Ross\" on it.",
        "Ohh-oh, chilling!",
        "Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.",
        "No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas.",
        "Oh hey Joey! What's up?",
        "Yeah, I've been around.",
        "Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}",
        "But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.",
        "Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.",
        "Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax. Take a deep breath. Clear your mind. (Quickly) Which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites?",
        "Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?",
        "Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?",
        "No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?",
        "North route or south route?",
        "Bamn! There you go! Huh?",
        "Oh, this guy again. (She ignores him.)",
        "Umm, no thank you. (She gets up and moves to the couch. They were at a table previously.)",
        "Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!",
        "Bye!",
        "Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.",
        "Well, if you don't know I can't help you.",
        "Well, I can't help you.",
        "Apology accepted.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "(quietly) Bye, fat ass.",
        "I don't know! I don't remember!",
        "Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fat ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney.",
        "No.",
        "No that made me feel precious.",
        "That game should not be played without my supervision.",
        "What's in the bag?",
        "I do!",
        "Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. (Thinks) Or-or Rachel!",
        "Hey, dude!",
        "Oh that's my grandma. (Joey holds the box away from him.) And thanks Joey she's having a really great time. (Joey is happy now.)",
        "Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering… (We hear the dial tone as Joey hangs up.) Okay, I guess he ran out of change.",
        "No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with p0rn!",
        "Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison.",
        "Uh-hmm.",
        "Fauna.",
        "Garfunkle.",
        "You said I was boring--Ohh!",
        "Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!",
        "Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz! (Realizes) Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream.",
        "Okay! Okay! Okay! (They run into the chapel.)",
        "(to her) Hey! Don’t you give me any of your—Hey! (Sees Chandler and Monica standing there.)",
        "Well, maybe you wouldn’t have had you (turns to the attendant) run in the chapel!",
        "What’s the big deal, y’know? It’s not like it’s a real marriage.",
        "Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you’re only married in Vegas.",
        "(shocked) Really?!",
        "Oh my God!—Eh! Well…",
        "Oh Joey, I’m so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?",
        "What about my cab?",
        "No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.",
        "I don’t know, it’s such a long trip.",
        "Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?",
        "All right. Although I don’t think we need one, I never stopped loving you.",
        "Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.",
        "Well you don’t.",
        "Good! Good! I was just testing you.",
        "No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable.",
        "Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.",
        "Hell, I’m drunk right now! (They all turn and look at her.) What? I can’t have a mimosa with breakfast?! I’m on vacation!",
        "Oh-oh, that’s your thing.",
        "You’re thing. You’re thing. Y’know? You’re the guy who gets divorced.",
        "Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you’re probably gonna marry it! Then it won’t work out and you’re gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. (Pause) I’m so drunk.",
        "Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. (Joey groans.) Come on Joey! You can’t win if you don’t ask any (sees that he’s asleep) QUESTIONS!!!",
        "Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We’ve been on the road six hours and you’ve been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!",
        "Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio’s broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.",
        "Sing!!",
        "(To Joey) How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape—(She holds her hand in front of the hitchhiker’s face), a rapist or a killer or something!",
        "Y’know what? I’m not talking to you! You go back to sleep! (To the hitchhiker) And you, are you a rapist?!",
        "Do you like car games?",
        "I love the license plate game!",
        "No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh! (She closes the partition.)",
        "Oh, okay.",
        "And I have your name and the fact that you’re a drifter, so the ball’s pretty much in your court.",
        "Stop it! Stop it no! That’s not fair! Y’know I can’t resist that beautiful voice!",
        "You can still sleep at night and stuff.",
        "Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?",
        "Is it a meatball sub?",
        "No thanks, I’ve already seen one.",
        "Always.",
        "What?!",
        "Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie?",
        "(smiles) Okay! (Goes to answer the phone.)",
        "(answering the phone) Hello? (Listens) Hey Joey!",
        "Sure! Where is it?",
        "Ohh! So you're 5639?!",
        "(to Joey) Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?",
        "Who was that?",
        "Yeah! (She hands the phone to Chandler.)",
        "Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! (Starts looking around for her) Monica? (Goes into Monica's bedroom.)",
        "(saddened) It's okay. What the hell took you so long?",
        "Which Richard?",
        "Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!",
        "Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?",
        "That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.",
        "But again, Simmons. Go on.",
        "Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?",
        "Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!",
        "Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks!",
        "On a totally different bet.",
        "Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.",
        "Okay, I'm gonna go too!",
        "Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.",
        "Uh-huh, great story! I'm going!",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?!",
        "Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!",
        "Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.",
        "Naked alone time.",
        "Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?",
        "So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?",
        "Okay, what about after I give you these candies? (Hands them each one from her purse.)",
        "Ah-ha! Okay, (takes out a notepad) Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back. (Gets up and heads aft.)",
        "(sitting down) Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.",
        "Oh no. [The patented version.]",
        "(To Monica under her breath) Simmons! Go with Simmons!",
        "Okay, London 1…",
        "Hey you guys wait! Guys! (Catches up to them.) This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!",
        "For 99 cents, I'd eat you. (Sees the casino) Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! (Points to Joey in his gladiator suit posing for a picture with two old ladies.) Oh! Look! Hi!",
        "Hey! Joey! (They all head over to him, he spots them coming and panics.) Hey! Hey!! Wow! (She hugs him.)",
        "Why are you dressed as a gladiator?",
        "So you're a gladiator! Wow!",
        "Monica had lunch with Richard.",
        "Noo! But that would've been so cool!",
        "I love Vegas!",
        "Thanks.",
        "Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. (Monica turns and stares at her.) I am so sorry.",
        "So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.",
        "Sure! (When Monica gets close to the door.) (Yelling) Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah?",
        "Ohh, you are so lucky! (To Chandler) Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up?",
        "But she just came up here!",
        "I wonder where she is. That is so weird.",
        "Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!",
        "Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.",
        "Good. (After he leaves, she puts on Joey's gladiator helmet and checks herself out in the mirror) I should really start wearing hats!",
        "(sees Ross and Rachel) Hey!",
        "You guys are here! Yay!",
        "(sees Rachel's face) What? Did you go to a costume party? Let me guess umm Pancho Vila? (Points at Rachel) and you're Bob Saget. (An old lady has sat down at the slot machine Phoebe was just at.)",
        "Yeah! (Motions to her face, indicating all of Rachel's \"make-up.\")",
        "Whoa, what kind of party was this?",
        "Ugh!",
        "That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing.",
        "M-M-Mole people?",
        "Oh. What's a lurker?",
        "Kills you?",
        "Ohhh!",
        "How do you know about this?",
        "Dance karate?",
        "(seeing her) Get out of here you lurker! (She doesn't move) Go on! Get! (She throws a quarter at her.)",
        "Ohh! You made up!",
        "Ohh, get a room.",
        "I know. Use it.",
        "Oh well, lost again. (She gets up and slowly moves away. The lurker scurries in and takes her spot, only this time Phoebe set a trap for her and catches her in the act.) That's it! You and me, outside!",
        "Be cool! (They both pretend to have a nice conversation as the guard walks by, but after he leaves they both start fighting again.) Okay lady, your lurking days are over!",
        "Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move on to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll be on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When do you leave?",
        "What time? Maybe we can share a cab!",
        "I won! I won! I finally won!",
        "Fine! Here! Take a hike toots! (Gives back her quarter.)",
        "(quietly) Sells drugs to kids.",
        "She sells drugs to kids. (The guard looks at the lurker.)",
        "How about we talk about this over dinner?",
        "No! No, you can't arrest me! No!! I won't go back! I won't go back to that hell hole!!",
        "Oh, okay. (Walks out.)",
        "(entering and sitting down at the table.) Hello. My name is Regina Phalange. I'm a businesswoman in town on business. Would you like to see my card? (Looks down) Ooh, what did I do with my file-a-facts? I must've left it in conference room B.",
        "Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world.",
        "No, you threw out Phoebe. I'm Ms. Regina Phalange. Phalange!",
        "I'm fine, thanks.",
        "Nope. (Chandler nods in agreement.)",
        "Okay. Bye!",
        "So, what movie should we see?",
        "What?! Really?!",
        "I can't believe this!",
        "No, but it is fast. Isn't it?",
        "No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!",
        "I don't know. I'll just handle it—I'll ask you to talk to him!",
        "Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a…man!",
        "Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?",
        "What?!",
        "You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!",
        "Ohh!! God! (Gary enters and she sees him) Ooh! (To Chandler) Get out of here, good for nothing.",
        "Yeah! Okay. (They move to the couch.)",
        "Thanks! Okay. (They sit down.)",
        "Yeah?",
        "Uh-hmm.",
        "No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this. (She stays still for a brief second.)",
        "Yeah?",
        "That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.",
        "I just—I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.",
        "I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just—I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.",
        "Which is why my answer is yes!",
        "Uh-huh! (They hug.) I'm so…happy. (She's not happy.)",
        "We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!",
        "I know, I'm so excited!",
        "Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the most excited!",
        "Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!",
        "I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.",
        "No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?",
        "Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.",
        "No, nothing.",
        "Yeah.",
        "No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't have a pool, I need a pool. (Turns away from him.)",
        "Uh-huh!",
        "(sits down) Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together.",
        "Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. (Pause) Can I get some water?",
        "Umm, yeah! Today's.",
        "(looks at the paper) Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging!",
        "Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts! (Pause) I'm sorry! (Puts her head down.)",
        "Yeah?",
        "That's so sweet.",
        "Living with you would make me happy.",
        "No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!",
        "Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in! (Hugs him.)",
        "Oh wait, one sec. One sec. (Goes to the mirror) Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms, (sees the look on his face) which was never!",
        "I like waking up with you too. (Looks out the window) Oh! It's such a beautiful morning. (Some birds are singing outside the window) Oh, I can stay here all day.",
        "We could have breakfast in bed…",
        "Okay. (He grabs his gun and shoots the bird.) Oh! Oh no.",
        "(entering) Oh good, you're all up.",
        "Oh yeah, that's over.",
        "He shot a bird!",
        "Yeah. Yeah, I'll be alright.",
        "(catches it) Nah, I don't feel like playing. (She sets the ball down on the table and everyone gasps.)",
        "Yeah!",
        "Always.",
        "What?!",
        "(running out) Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?",
        "Oh, there’s a cab! Taxi!! (The cab stops and she opens the door.) Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go. (Pushes Rachel in and closes the door.)",
        "Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go! (She bangs on the cab’s roof and it pulls away.) (To Ross) You didn’t get the annulment?!!",
        "Ross?!",
        "Don’t be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y’know? Mine’s gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.",
        "So okay what? You’re gonna be married to a girl who doesn’t even know about it?!—Op, woman! Sorry.",
        "Rachel is one of my closest friends. (Pause) Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!",
        "Hey Rach!",
        "Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?",
        "Well then you’d better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go! (Bangs on the roof again and off they go.)",
        "Hey!",
        "No, why?",
        "(gasps) You’re pregnant!",
        "Ooh! That’s good! Wow! But now if you were pregnant, what would you name it? Hint: Phoebe.",
        "Guys, I’m happy too.",
        "Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled… (Winks at Ross.)",
        "Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel… Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!",
        "Ross, it’s not that big a deal! So you’ll been divorced three times, you’ll still have a life, you’ll go on dates…",
        "Ross, you’re being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!",
        "Y’know that’s really fair. Y’know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I’ll show you! Come here.",
        "(to the girls) Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn’t you date him?",
        "Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn’t be interested? Who wouldn’t want to date him?",
        "Okay, what about you? (Points to Karin) Wouldn’t you want a date?",
        "(interrupting) Whatever! What about you Meg?",
        "(leaning to him) She said, \"He’s obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.\" (He glares at her.)",
        "Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.",
        "Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!",
        "Yes, and now he’s using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, \"Well done!\" Bravo Meg.",
        "(to Joey and Chandler) Okay, bye!",
        "So? Did you get the annulment?",
        "I knew it! Because you love Rachel.",
        "Yeah, complicated ‘cause of the love.",
        "I’ve never been more convinced of your love for her.",
        "Oh we do, but not just yet.",
        "Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won’t work out.",
        "I know. Then, I’m gonna marry Chandler for the money and you’ll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.",
        "But then we ditch those two and that’s when we get married. We’ll have Chandler’s money and Rachel’s kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel’s drinking problem.",
        "I don’t want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.",
        "(overdoing it) Oh my God!!",
        "Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!",
        "Another lie. You have a sickness!",
        "(coming in from the bathroom) Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!",
        "Okay, well I’ll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, they’re not actually puppies, they’re Frank and Alice’s triplets. Okay, see ya! (Exits.)",
        "(stops) Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I’m nervous ‘cause I’ve never done that before by myself!",
        "What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don’t have a roommate.",
        "Maybe you could be my roommate!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Umm, she said she’d be back December 26th.",
        "(rapidly) I’m doing okay. I think it’s going well. Do you think they’re having fun? Am I talking to fast?",
        "Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.",
        "That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.",
        "Yeah? (Checking the final diaper) Well this is not what I ordered.",
        "Hey!",
        "I don’t know why I was so nervous about this. And I don’t know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.",
        "No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that’s just gonna mess them up.",
        "What?!",
        "Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.",
        "Oh, I can still do that.",
        "How did that happen?!!",
        "Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.",
        "What?! No, you can’t, you can’t leave me here with them! We’re baby-sitting!",
        "But you-you can’t leave me with them! We-we’re a team! We’re playing a zone! They’re gonna triple team me!",
        "But no, because a doctor won’t be able to help him, it’s just gonna y’know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.",
        "I’m pretty sure it’s gun.",
        "A real man wouldn’t just run to the hospital! (They don’t stop.) No! What would, what would Krog do? (They ignore her and Phoebe is left alone.)",
        "Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, I’m gonna take that spit bubble as, \"Yeah, I do!\" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I’ll set you up with a clean one. (She throws it at the garbage without looking, misses, and knocks over a vase and flowers, which fall to the floor and break.) Okay, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? ‘Cause let’s face it, we’re at Monica’s. (She crawls over, disposes of the diaper, picks up the flowers, and the vase.) I broke it. All right. Well, that’s just the way that goes. (She throws out both the flowers and the vase.) Okay, good. (She turns around and only counts two babies.) Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can’t answer. (She starts looking for her) Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! (She turns around and finds that Leslie has managed to crawl into the bottom drawer of the TV cabinet.) Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! (She picks her up and notices a surprise is waiting in the drawer.) Oh, you’re a lot mischievous! Well, it’ll dry. (Closes the drawer with her foot.) (To Leslie) Okay, you sit with your brother and sister now—who aren’t there! (They both have disappeared as well.)",
        "(exhausted) How do you feel?",
        "Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed ‘em, bathed ‘em, and put ‘em to bed.",
        "I know, the babies are asleep.",
        "I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!",
        "Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!",
        "Uh-huh, what?",
        "Oh!",
        "Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?",
        "My roommate.",
        "Yes, Denise. Denise!",
        "Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!",
        "Hey.",
        "So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?",
        "You didn’t tell her did you?",
        "Of course not, because you’re in love with her.",
        "What do you mean, comforted her?",
        "Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!",
        "Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson. (Tries to take a bite out of Ross’s cookie.)",
        "Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?",
        "Ninety percent of a women’s pheromones come out the top of her head! That’s why, that’s why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! (Ross is staring at her dumbfounded.) Oh come on Ross, you’re a scientist.",
        "(taking his coffee) Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel’s not in the same place you are.",
        "Okay, I didn’t understand that, but y’know, maybe that’s ‘cause you were speaking the secret language of love!",
        "Shhhhhh! I’m swamped right now.",
        "Umm, I’m trying to move that pencil. (There’s a pencil lying on the table.)",
        "It worked!",
        "Wait, no, look at this! (Points to one.) (Reading) \"Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay…\" Oh, yeah, but it’s on the ground floor.",
        "I saw it.",
        "Umm, I’m talking about that which you already know but won’t admit. You love her again; you re-love her!",
        "I can’t believe you won’t just admit it! (Pause) Okay, just promise me that you won’t do anything stupid.",
        "What?!",
        "Wow! I’m-I’m so happy for you guys. (To Ross) This is so-so, not stupid.",
        "No. No, I won’t. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn’t love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that’s how she ended up living with me! (Ross looks at her.) (Pause) Okay, that’s a lie.",
        "(singing) I found you in my bed!\n                          How’d you whined up there?\n                          You are a mystery!\n                          Little black curly hair!\n                          Little black curly hair!\n                          Little black, little black, little black, little black, little black curly hair…………",
        "Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.",
        "(on the microphone, accidentally) Yes.",
        "So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?",
        "Well, how much do you think he needs?",
        "Why don’t you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.",
        "And also, my birthday.",
        "What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it’s not your birthday!",
        "Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?",
        "My God, I can’t get a minute of peace around this place.",
        "Oh my God! Monica’s just gonna kill you.",
        "Well, what you’re wearing is fine for that.",
        "I have plans.",
        "That’s right.",
        "Okay.",
        "Hurry! Monica’s gonna make you pack! She’s got jobs for everyone! Now, it’s too late for me, but save your selves! (The guys scramble for the door.)",
        "You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time… (She starts laughing hysterically.) You don’t remember?",
        "Well, this doesn’t have to be so sad though. Y’know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you’re gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you’re not gonna miss.",
        "Come on, there’s gotta be something.",
        "Good! Great! You can go first.",
        "Good that’s a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y’know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?",
        "Okay, good. There you go. Doesn’t anyone feel better?",
        "Great! It worked! No one’s sad.",
        "Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?",
        "Hey! I call her!",
        "Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations. (Phoebe dumps a drawer full of makeup into a box.)",
        "Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she’s the one who’s leaving. It’s harder for her!",
        "I know, I took it hard too.",
        "Hey, how are you guys doing?",
        "Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what’s going on here. Okay, you guys… STOP!! (They stop.) I know that, I know that you’re acting mad because you think that it’ll make it easier to leave. But deep down you’re still really sad. Deep-deep down.",
        "Well, deep-deep-deep down!",
        "Then keep running. (They resume the chase.)",
        "Hey you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore.",
        "You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!",
        "What else?",
        "That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.",
        "Okay Rachel, I can’t wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We’ll have so much fun!!",
        "Oh that’s right. You’re still set on that?",
        "Ross, I know what you’re thinking.",
        "That she’s gonna move in with you and maybe then she’ll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you’re already married, she’ll just be happy. Y’know? You’re just, you’re very sad.",
        "What?!!",
        "No! (Ross’s phone rings.)",
        "Yeah, Professor and Mrs.",
        "Oh! Yeah, y’know you and Ross are still married.",
        "Just kidding!",
        "(To Ross) Saved your ass.",
        "Hi.",
        "Well, you know that psychic I see?",
        "Well, she told me that I’m gonna die this week, so I’m kinda bummed about that.",
        "Yeah, and I know you guys don’t know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.",
        "I don’t—she said y’know that I’d have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.",
        "No, ‘cause she didn’t tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I’ve only got a week left, y’know? I’ve really gotta start living now! (So she picks up the latest copy of Car and Driver (a U.S. auto magazine), leans back, and starts reading.)",
        "Oh, this is it. This what’s gonna kill me.",
        "Hey!",
        "Ugh, it’s so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way, do you think you could—(Groans, hacks, and then freezes with her eyes open and her tongue hanging out.)",
        "I was preparing you for my—didn’t you think I was dead? Did that not come off?",
        "Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can.",
        "Hey!",
        "What’s going on?",
        "Hey! Maybe you’ll die!",
        "No, we can go together! Just don’t wait too long though, okay? ‘Cause I’m outta here sometime before Friday.",
        "No-no, it’ll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Listen to this! My reading was wrong, I’m not going die!",
        "Because my psychic is dead! She must’ve read the cards wrong!",
        "Eh, better her than me! Hey, let’s bake cookies!",
        "Have you really done this before?",
        "Hey!",
        "We’re just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.",
        "(Walking over and Sitting down.) Hey.",
        "Rachel?",
        "I’m, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So, can I come to Bloomingdale’s and use the copy machine.",
        "Oh my God. What happened?",
        "Well that’s great! Congratulations!! (She hugs Rachel.)",
        "(Hugging her again.) You’ve lasted a whole year. Good for you.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Now you will not believe this. But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in.",
        "Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser.",
        "Totally.",
        "Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know, we’re making out. You know.",
        "No!",
        "What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he’s married? (Rachel looks at her.) No, yeah, I should.",
        "Hey. Here. (Hands Chandler a copy of her flyer and sees the picture of Ralph.) Ohh, who’s the silver fox?",
        "That’s not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.",
        "Yeah, no, Ralph doesn’t look anything like that guy. He’s-he’s young and he’s got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.",
        "What?",
        "Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?",
        "Ohhh.",
        "Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? (He smiles at her.) OH!! Demon!! Demon!!",
        "But why didn’t you just tell her the truth.",
        "Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?",
        "Just for a second.",
        "Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.",
        "Ohh, sleep with Kenny.",
        "Ohh, yes it would.",
        "Ready?",
        "Okay.",
        "it's...",
        "and…",
        "please...",
        "leave…",
        "Yeah, I know because you have all the good words. What do I get? I get \"it’s,\" \"and\" oh I'm sorry, I have \"A.\" Forget it.",
        "All right, so let's switch.",
        "Okay.",
        "Hi…",
        "It's…",
        "and…",
        "Please...wait, how did you do that?",
        "Oh, you're no ordinary roommate are you?",
        "Really?",
        "Okay, let's go running!",
        "Let's run towards them!",
        "All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message, thanks!",
        "Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green.",
        "I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up.",
        "Okay. (Starts running crazily with her arms flapping and her legs far apart) Come on! That's not running! Let's go! (Rachel pauses, then follows, embarrassed.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Why? Why would you do that?",
        "(jumps in front of Rachel) Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.",
        "Please Rachel, I am not an idiot. (Runs off)",
        "Sure",
        "So, what should you have done?",
        "Uh-Huh, Which is...?",
        "So?",
        "Why do you care?",
        "But people that you don't know and will never see again.",
        "Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss (panting). But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight.",
        "That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didn’t you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan? (Rachel looks confused) The neighbor's dog.",
        "Hey!",
        "See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone!",
        "She’s made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.",
        "Yeah well, we’ll see.",
        "Hey!",
        "(sees the table) Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it?",
        "Umm, a flea market?",
        "Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where (She’s opening and closing the drawers) they kept all the stuff to make their potions.",
        "Y’know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.",
        "How much was it?",
        "500 bucks at a flea market?!",
        "Oh no.",
        "A dollar?",
        "Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.",
        "Well, what period is it from?",
        "Yes, yes I do. God, oh it’s just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y’know where it was from or…",
        "(gasps) White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Okay. Hey—Ooh, cool sheets! (Notices the sheet over the table.)",
        "Sure!",
        "You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.",
        "Oh sure! (She goes to take her feet off, but drags the sheet with her which spills the wine.) Noo!",
        "What?!",
        "Ross, where did you get this?!",
        "Wow! Oh my God, well if they’ve ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!",
        "Well this doesn’t even smell like opium.",
        "Oh Ross, calm down, I’ll give you the 80 cents. (Ross glares at Rachel)",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "(sees Ross) Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.",
        "(gasps) Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!",
        "Ah!",
        "Yeah no, I’m telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, y’know if you ever decide you need to redecorate—And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.",
        "Oh, come on! I think he’s ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.",
        "No! I do want to!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.",
        "Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!",
        "No! Look-look! There’s the coffee table they stole from us!",
        "That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the…wait a sec! This is our exact living room!",
        "Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!",
        "No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it’s all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don’t have that lamp!",
        "I can’t! I can’t! Unless… Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn’t buy that lamp?",
        "But are you saying that you would move out if I didn’t buy that lamp?",
        "Okay then I don’t have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!",
        "But at least the apothecary table is real.",
        "That is nice and we’re done. TADA!",
        "Yeah, Chandler why don’t you take a walk? This doesn’t concern you.",
        "No-no, we do it every year!",
        "No, yeah, we never find them! She’s always best at us that wily minx.",
        "But we have to!",
        "Well then, you should look with us.",
        "Oh, that’s it? (Mimics Chandler) A great idea!",
        "Ooh ooh, we have a live one!",
        "Ooh, who’s it for?",
        "Uh-oh. She may be onto us.",
        "Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!",
        "Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!",
        "Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz.",
        "Hey! Look who I found!",
        "Y’know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.",
        "Or we could just follow your clever jokes – any ideas? No! Didn’t think so! Okay, c’mon guys, show us where the presents are!",
        "Hmm, how about my azzz?",
        "What?",
        "No, don’t look directly at them!",
        "Alright, no, we could look at them!",
        "Oh, this one’s for Chandler. Here.",
        "And the big one’s for me!",
        "Hee hee!",
        "Will you get us better gifts?",
        "Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless.",
        "Hey!",
        "Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case Rachel’s dessert is...[about to say “bad”] so good that I eat all of it. There’s none left for anybody else!",
        "And who else is going to be there?",
        "Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.",
        "Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.",
        "Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it’s making me look at him totally differently. Y’know, I mean he used to be just, y’know “Jack Geller Monica and Ross’s dad” and now he’s he’s “Jack Geller, dream hunk.\"",
        "Rachel?",
        "Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn’t give to be that can of (looks closer to see what Jack is drinking) condensed milk.",
        "Monica, leave him alone!",
        "So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn’t it?",
        "Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?",
        "I can’t have any. You know I don’t eat meat. (Faking dissapointment.) Ohhh no.",
        "Rachel, come here. (Rachel walks over to Phoebe. Chandler sits down on the lounge-chair.) Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.",
        "I dunno, let’s see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.",
        "Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.",
        "Five minutes ago, a line like that would’ve floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.",
        "(joining in) I love Jacques Cousteau!",
        "I didn’t know Playboy prints jokes.",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "Wh-wh-what are you doing?",
        "Oh, I want to look too! (She runs over and sits down and checks out a picture). Yikes!",
        "Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?",
        "Rachel.",
        "I don’t know. (Pause) Me neither.",
        "I guess it was kinda funny.",
        "Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you’re … just … kinda high maintenance—Okay let’s go to lunch!",
        "No, okay, you’re right. You’re easy-going. You’re just not as easy-going as Rachel. She’s just more flexible and-and mellow. That’s all.",
        "Ya, you know, Rachel … she’ll do whatever you want. Y’know, you can just walk all over her.",
        "Oh, okay, (laughing) you’re not a pushover.",
        "Okay.",
        "That true, I am flaky.",
        "Yeah, totally.",
        "That’s great. Good for you guys.",
        "Who said you were?",
        "Oh, I’m flaky. I’ll say anything.",
        "Really? I’ve heard better.",
        "(to Monica) Y’know, suddenly I find you very attractive.",
        "Wow! That is a bad audition.",
        "(returning from the bathroom) Rach, you’re in my seat.",
        "Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.",
        "Yeah, well, I kinda thought.",
        "(dejected) Hi, you guys.",
        "Well it’s just—it’s one of those situations that I just hate. Y’know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.",
        "No! No! It’s just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!",
        "Okay that’s so generous!",
        "Great! Okay then it’s just us girls!",
        "Yeah.",
        "It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.",
        "Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!",
        "(gasps) Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. (Giggles) Yeah I know; we’d be great together!",
        "So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer’s clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven’t been cleaned yet?",
        "Hey, and then lunch.",
        "Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he’s gonna tell you that he’s gay?",
        "No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?",
        "Yeah, but there’s a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That’s four years. Chandler’s not gonna wait that long. He’s gonna find somebody else, y’know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list. (Rachel agrees.)",
        "Me too!",
        "I don’t know, I don’t have anyone right now. Y’know?",
        "Don’t feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn’t gay.",
        "Don’t even get me started on yours!",
        "Yeah?",
        "No! Why?",
        "Well for the regular guy, it’s bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!",
        "What are you gonna do?",
        "Rachel said that!",
        "Oh! Here it is! (Noticing it next to the door.) Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, \"Son of a bitch?\" (Son of a bitch is written across the entire picture.)",
        "Okay, maybe ask this guy.",
        "Well, what did he do?",
        "Joey!",
        "Well, we should go.",
        "(entering from her room) Hey, did she buy it?",
        "So did Heldi show you the place?",
        "I can’t believe you’re gonna ask Monica to marry you!",
        "What’s a Movement class?",
        "Oh my God! How bad was it?",
        "Coming through! (Has to dodge a fireman) Oh! Coming through! (Sees a cute one.) Oh! Hello! Hi! (Smiles then realizes) No! Right! Coming through!",
        "Oh!",
        "Oh, it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there that isn’t burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!",
        "No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now.",
        "Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It’s me! It’s me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!",
        "Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess (To Rachel) you should get to stay here.",
        "Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.",
        "What’s that smell?",
        "So did you sleep well last night?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Y’know what Joey left on my pillow?",
        "Gum!",
        "Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!",
        "I don’t use a curling iron.",
        "Thanks Monica!",
        "What the smell from Joey’s? No, I can hardly smell it over here.",
        "I can smell it a little, bake the pie.",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh! (Takes the phone.) Hello? (Listens) Yeah this is Phoebe. (Listens) Really?!",
        "Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.",
        "Oh that’s all right. I’m still full from your homemade potato chips.",
        "Okay. (Reaches for one.)",
        "(gritting her teeth) Okay, I’ll be out in a second.",
        "That doesn’t lock does it?",
        "(entering) Hey! Hi!",
        "(To Rachel) Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you!",
        "Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I’m partly at fault. You see, I didn’t, I didn’t tell you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y’know let’s just face it, that’s just kindling! So I think it’s better that I stay at Joey’s.",
        "Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.",
        "Yeah she said something about crumbies.",
        "(To Rachel) Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me crazy!",
        "No but at Monica’s you can eat cookies over the sink!",
        "All right fine! This looks like so much fun. (Examining the bowl of wet paper towels.)",
        "God, what a mess. (She grabs the bowl and heads for Monica’s.)",
        "Yeah Joey that is so gross!",
        "(giggles) I’m pretty.",
        "Oh I do! (She grabs her huge purse and starts rummaging through it and taking out various items in a futile search for the gum.) Oh, y’know what? No. (Pause) Wait a second. (She removes a bag filled with water that has a goldfish swimming in it.) I know it’s in here somewhere.",
        "(To Ross) Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or that’s bitter?",
        "Never mind, I got it.",
        "Of course, yeah!",
        "Ooh, I like cards.",
        "Seriously, I don’t Rachel’s gonna think it’s a good idea.",
        "I would love that job!",
        "Sorry Jill.",
        "Oh well, all right, I got (Ross hands her a bag) (To Ross) thank you, I got uh, this y’know \"I want a job sweater.\" (Holds up the same sweater.)",
        "And, and then I got uh, these are apartment pants.",
        "Yeah, you never heard of them?",
        "What about, what about when I said y’know about the apartment pants, how dumb was I?",
        "(gets up and sits between them) Okay-okay, why don’t I sit here and you’ll both stop it!",
        "Hey.",
        "Umm, I think there’s something you should maybe know.",
        "No. No. It’s just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I’m pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.",
        "Yeah I mean it’s probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Okay then.",
        "But great news about the apartment pants, huh?",
        "Wow!",
        "No! Barry and Mindy.",
        "Which time?",
        "What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?",
        "Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.",
        "Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y’know that if I’d work with stocks, I’d have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "What?",
        "Ohh that’s so sweet! (Her cell phone rings.) Oh! Hang on! (Quickly grabs a cigarette and starts to light it as her phone rings.) Hang onnnnnn!!! (Gets the cigarette lighted and answers the phone.) (On phone.) Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it hits 50! 5-0, it’s a number! It comes after 4-9!! No, it’s okay. It’s okay, you’re allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired.",
        "Hi!",
        "Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! (Answering the phone.) Go!! Who’s this? (Listens) Oh okay, you’re gonna like working for me. What’s your name? (Listens) What kind of name is Brendy? I… Whatever… Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.",
        "(yelling from Monica’s room) No-no!! No!!",
        "No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.",
        "What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can’t call my office they’ll kill me! I can’t call my clients they’ll kill themselves! Great, now my chest hearts.",
        "(louder) My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I can’t breathe.",
        "Oh, if I were, would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm?",
        "Then yes that is what I’m having. (Takes another puff of the cigarette.)",
        "Most people don’t like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I’m already going crazy. I miss Joan.",
        "(To Ross) So what’s going on with you?",
        "Still going through that dry spell with Carol?",
        "How long has it been since you had s*x?",
        "Oh that’s not so bad.",
        "That is.",
        "Maybe you need to spice things up a little.",
        "I don’t know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other…",
        "Y’know, dirty talk, mange-a-tois, toys…",
        "Roll playing… You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!",
        "Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you’re-you’re-you’re rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody’s watching! (Ross looks at her.) It never happened.",
        "Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.",
        "No! It’s not a cigarette! The smoke is coming out of me!",
        "Okay! Okay! (Puts it out and comes out of the bathroom.) I’m so glad you’re here.",
        "Oh, give it to me.",
        "Give it!",
        "Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!",
        "Thank God.",
        "Hey.",
        "Well, I’ve got to get out of this bed, I’m going crazy here. Crazy!",
        "What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!",
        "What are you two girls whispering about over there?!",
        "Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here! (Points at Ross.)",
        "I know! But if I didn’t work there, what else would I do?",
        "Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!",
        "Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change—ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!",
        "I thought I’d try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I’ll be back soon.",
        "No. I’ve learned my lesson.",
        "Let’s go! Come on! Move it! (Grabs her coat.) Come on! (To an old man who’s holding her shoes and briefcase.) Shoes! Briefcase! (Takes them both.) Thanks Lou, good luck with the gall bladder. (She leaves.)",
        "Surprise! Look who’s back!",
        "Hey!",
        "Uh, I don’t think so!",
        "Jack!! Hey!",
        "All better! Back to work! Except this clown from research told me I was fired. He should do his research, huh?",
        "Nu-uh!",
        "Oh, okay I didn’t get that message. So this doesn’t count—Anyway, I’ll be in my office.",
        "That’s all right, I’ll work here. This is goo, next to this plant. (She picks a place in the lobby next to a plant.)",
        "You’re in my office! Look, I have made a lot of cash for this company! Okay? I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake…",
        "Oh, so this is all about money! Y’know it’s bad enough that—Ow! Oh, you have got to be kidding!",
        "I’m having another heart attack!",
        "I’m having another heart attack!! Call 9-1-1!!",
        "(to Arthur, he’s the guy calling 9-1-1) Dumbass!",
        "Well, they fired me and I’m having heart attack.",
        "Yeah.",
        "(singing)",
        "Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?",
        "Y’know, this is probably none of my business, but weren’t you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?",
        "Oh, sly.",
        "(interrupting) Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12?",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.",
        "Oh that’s good, I guess she’ll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.",
        "‘Cause that’s just your taste.",
        "Oh yeah?",
        "My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these (She squeezes the skin on her chin together to form…)",
        "A chin dimple!",
        "Have you seen your guy’s body?",
        "Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He’s a massage client and one time umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it.",
        "Oh yeah, like there are police for that!",
        "I know. (Laughs.)",
        "Oh, Chandler funny?",
        "My guy is well read.",
        "My guy has great teeth!",
        "Hey!",
        "What did you do on yours?",
        "Rachel, what the hell is this?!",
        "You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!",
        "Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.",
        "So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?",
        "No reason, it’s just I know a single guy that cares about other people.",
        "Well, so do a lot of people.",
        "Yeah, y’know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you’d like to take to a ball? \"Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?\" (Imitates him.) \"Uhh, okay—I gotta go!\"",
        "Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y’know you might even end up with someone really special (whispers) if you pick my guy.",
        "Okay sure!",
        "Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.",
        "Okay.",
        "Ross, you can’t tell her not to go. You just started dating.",
        "Nothing, you just have to be cool with it.",
        "This is Patrick. (Points to him.)",
        "(looks) Oh my God, you’re right! I am too late; they’re sitting on the couch and talking! (To Patrick) Come on! (They go over to the couch.) Rachel?",
        "This is Patrick.",
        "Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about.",
        "Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to what’s underneath it.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Oh! Okay! Yeah, that’s okay. (To Patrick) Have a seat. (Sits Patrick down next to Rachel.)",
        "Rachel? Patrick is really rich. (To Patrick) Give her some money.",
        "Yeah, okay, let’s talk it out.",
        "Then why did she ask us to…",
        "Rachel, we’re sorry for pushing those guys on you.",
        "Oh my God, look! That’s Elizabeth!",
        "Or, y’know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you’ve got y’know a little of this (she sticks her chest out and shakes it) goin’ on. Wow! I still have it!",
        "Hey!",
        "Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!",
        "Now, we can kick anybody’s ass!",
        "Yeah it is! It is! It’s freshwater eel!",
        "(deadpan) Come on Ross. We’re sorry. Please tell us what it is.",
        "You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?",
        "No.",
        "Ooh, Joey, that’s actually a really good idea!",
        "You guys!",
        "Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?",
        "What is that?",
        "Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! (She takes out a sock that’s been made into a bunny with eyes, nose, mouth, whiskers, and two other socks sown onto it for ears.) Oh for crying out loud!",
        "Now, it’s you little bunny friend. (She sticks it in Rachel’s face and they both laugh.)",
        "Ross!!!",
        "Ohh, you’re a freak!!",
        "Pat Sajak?",
        "Alex Trebek?",
        "Chuck Woolery?",
        "Say we are unagi!",
        "(stopping her) No Rachel! They got here first!",
        "Why is Ross doing that?",
        "We should help him!",
        "Now, have you told anyone else?",
        "You told me.",
        "Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn’t been on the toilet.",
        "Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?",
        "Yeah, coffeehouse.",
        "So how are things going with Paul?",
        "That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won’t open.",
        "No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.",
        "(To Rachel) Watch this.",
        "Hi Paul!",
        "So how are things going with you?",
        "Yeah! That was so weird, huh?",
        "I didn’t do it! It was Chandler! He’s… He’s mad at you!",
        "Please, I think you know why.",
        "Come on Ross, you’re a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.",
        "Do you think that’s something that he’d be mad at you for?",
        "Well then I think that’s it.",
        "Oh, if that’s what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.",
        "Okay, so maybe you don’t get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y’know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y’know? Or an engagement tiara? Or—ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.",
        "Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?",
        "(coming over after returning the musket) Wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.",
        "Or not, whatever.",
        "Chandler, I-I will handle this! (To the jeweler) How much is it?",
        "We will give you $10.",
        "We stand firm at $10.",
        "Okay. (To the jeweler) Listen, I’m sorry about before. Do you have anything her for $10.",
        "I’ll give you $1 for them.",
        "Okay umm, I’d also like to try on the tiara. (The male jeweler hands it to her.) Oh yeah. Okay. (Puts it on.) (To the jeweler) What do you think, too much?",
        "Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. (He hands it to her and Phoebe poses in front of one of those small mirrors.) Something’s missing. It’s not… Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.",
        "Oh my God!! (She runs after him, but sets of the security system, which locks the store’s door and brings down a set of bars behind her, caging her in.) No! What?! Help me! Let me out! Now! (Points the musket at them.)",
        "Chandler, I found the perfect ring. (Holding it out for her.)",
        "Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It’s over!",
        "Some guy bought it. I’m sorry. I tired to stop it but they (points to the jeweler) put me in jail!",
        "The little jail between the doors!",
        "I know, I’m sorry! But y’know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.",
        "Maybe it was the guy.",
        "(entering from her room) Hey.",
        "It’s not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It’s a beautiful ring!",
        "Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. ‘Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.",
        "Well you certainly can’t give her that stupid gumball ring.",
        "There he is! (Points.)",
        "Wow! You’re good! After this, we should solve crimes.",
        "Oh, okay. (Walks over to him.) Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.",
        "It is your office.",
        "John?",
        "(To Chandler) Here he is.",
        "Wow! I would trade.",
        "Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman’s heart?",
        "Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I’m not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity…",
        "(entering) Hi.",
        "What?",
        "Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.",
        "You’ve got to get out of here! Save yourself!",
        "Don’t worry about me, I’m a robot! I’m just a machine!!",
        "(she stops reading from the script) Oh my God.",
        "I am extremely talented!",
        "(interrupting) No, I mean I was really acting my ass off.",
        "Oh yeah, you’re solid. Yeah, you’re just no me.",
        "(tremendously overacting) Fine! I’ll do it without you! (Joey gives her thumbs up) I don’t need you or anybody else! I’m gonna make it on my own! (Joey closes the door to his bedroom.) You’ll see!! You’ll all see!!",
        "I am.",
        "(overacting with a song this time) (singing) Gooood luck! Gooood luck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!",
        " Well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until... (The flashback shows Paulo lying face down on the massage table and slowly moving his hands up Phoebe's legs and grabbing her butt.)",
        " And all of the sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. (The flashback shows Paulo rolling over and showing Phoebe his equipment.)",
        " Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under it!",
        " It's not that bad.",
        " Chandler, Chandler.",
        "Oh!  All right.  Now, let's not do this!",
        "Happy thoughts!  Happy thoughts!",
        "OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.",
        "I know!  I know!  I know!",
        "Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.",
        "There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.",
        "(overacting badly) I can’t! My circuits are fried! They’re fried I tell you!!",
        "I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like, \"Ooh, where’d Ross go?\"",
        "Yeah?",
        "(To Ross) He’s holding us back.",
        "No! Joey, you’re going to be great!",
        "(in a sexy voice to Chandler) I’ll be waiting.",
        "No, I’m just deciding which one to use—I’m gonna start writing another book!",
        "Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one who has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received.",
        "Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut.",
        "I want to see what he wants first.",
        "You’re Elizabeth’s father, huh? I can see now where she gets her rugged handsomeness.",
        "Yeah. Not looking for dates. (Monica turns in horror.)",
        "(sympathetic) Ohh!",
        "(writing frantically) You guys, I’m sorry, could you please talk a little slower?",
        "Yeah, it’s about relationships. Y’know? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!",
        "And how none of it matters when the people really love each other. (Chandler and Monica kiss.) And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it’s a compliment.",
        "Hey!",
        "Well, why don’t you just get him fired?",
        "(writing in her book) \"You wish.\"",
        "I’m not writing about you! I’m writing about other people.",
        "Marcia and Chester.",
        "I see what you’re doing!",
        "Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!",
        "(Turning around in the chair) Hi!",
        "I know what time you said.",
        "Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.",
        "Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it’s my book to the rescue, huh? (Reading her book) Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.",
        "I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.",
        "Thanks! So are you.",
        "(reading from her book) Mon… (Pause as she restarts) Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they’re supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it’s at seven.",
        "That’s right.",
        "(writing in her book) Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.",
        "Yeah!",
        "If she says no, can I have the ring?",
        "If!",
        "(with her mouthful) Hi Monica.",
        "It’s gone.",
        "(To Chandler) We’re practically kissing. (Makes a kissy face and winks at him.)",
        "Open bar?",
        "I can do that for the kids.",
        "Y’know, you are 12 years older than her.",
        "Oh! Oop! (Hands him back the ring.)",
        "Here.",
        "So now what’s going on here?",
        "No, I know what a silent is I meant, what’s going on with your hair?",
        "No! It’s nice!",
        "Oh, hi. (They shake hands.)",
        "Hey you guys! Look!",
        "I got me some drinks!",
        "Open bar!",
        "You just can’t stand anyone else enjoying themselves can’t you?",
        "Forget her! You enjoy this!! (Pulls him back up and starts applauding again. Joey waves and does a salute.]",
        "Well, just buy the damn boat! (She’s still working her way through her tray of booze.)",
        "I’m just helping the kids!",
        "Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.",
        "Oh, okay.",
        "It’s a trip for two! (She gets up and takes off her blouse-type thingy she’s wearing over her dress.) Excuse me. (She walks over to table four.) Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?",
        "Oh, enchantée. (She holds out her hand for him to kiss it, but he only shakes it.)",
        "Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand! (Chandler is frantically trying to wave them off.)",
        "I wanna see what’s in your hand. I wanna see the trash.",
        "Eww! Oh, it’s all dirty. You should throw this out.",
        "What happened?",
        "Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor…",
        "Good one! Yeah.",
        "Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn’t know for sure, so just throw her off the track.",
        "Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you’re scared of commitment! Convince her that you’re a little coward!",
        "No, you’re too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!",
        "I know, they’re gonna be so happy together.",
        "Not that often!",
        "Me too! So happy for them!",
        "Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!",
        "Totally. I’m like 90/10.",
        "Definitely!",
        "What do you mean?",
        "You mean a backup?",
        "Yeah, yeah I got that.",
        "Hm-mmm.",
        "Joey.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yeah, I locked him years ago!",
        "Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.",
        "Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were… (She makes two clicking sounds with her tongue and purrs.)",
        "Well hey, it’s just a backup.",
        "Of course I can! It’s just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I’ve already lost Chandler!",
        "I don’t—Look I don’t know what you’re complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!",
        "Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we’re married!",
        "All right well let’s see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat—This is hard!",
        "No wait! Just—Okay—Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don’t make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week.",
        "(To Rachel) I’m talking about massages.",
        "Good!",
        "Left! (Rachel hands her the napkin in her left hand and they both unfold and read them.) Thank you.",
        "(reading) Ross!",
        "Yeah absolutely! (They both switch.)",
        "Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn’t here!",
        "Oh no, let her stay out there. It’s sweet.",
        "So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y’know, I’m kinda musical.",
        "Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?",
        "Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!",
        "Oh honey no, you ate it all.",
        "Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. (Singing)",
        "If you would’ve let me finish, it goes on to say that he’s probably not gay.",
        "I’m sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out. (Gets ready to play.)",
        "Really?! Oh that’s so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I’ll have to pound on you for a little bit.",
        "Okay. (She goes to get ready.)",
        "You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?",
        "What a great night, Chandler can’t do it, these guys kissed… (Points to Ross and Rachel.)",
        "Well yeah, that and Chandler’s problem.",
        "Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we’ll get us some Mai Thai’s, (To Chandler) maybe no more for you though.",
        "Why?!",
        "(she’s strumming something) Yeah? (Joey nods yes.) Okay, I think I’ll play it at the wedding.",
        "Well, I don’t think Monica is gonna take this away.",
        "Would she?",
        "Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I’m just gonna need a small deposit.",
        "Y’know, just some good faith money to hold the date.",
        "Oh, I see. (Exits angrily.)",
        "Y’know, I don’t really need their permission.",
        "Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you… You gotta do something about your eyes.",
        "They give you away! There’s just-there’s just too much wisdom in there. (Joey nods in agreement.) Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.",
        "Maybe just 10 minutes for you.",
        "(singing, angrily)",
        "(singing)",
        "Oh thank you.",
        "Now… (Starts singing again) \"Who will perform the ceremony! Who will perform the cer—(Chandler enters and grabs her guitar and closes the door behind him)—Oh—oh! All right, I’ll pound on him in the morning.",
        "It starts?",
        "That is so smart! (To Chandler, under her breath) Break it off. Break it off now.",
        "Hey! Ross!",
        "I need to talk to you, it’s pretty urgent. It’s about Monica and Chandler.",
        "Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y’know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?",
        "Nothing—Why?!",
        "Oh yeah it is! I’m going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.",
        "(to the students) Oh, I’m sorry. I’m so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?",
        "Oh Ross, hi.",
        "I’m sorry, I’m with a client right now.",
        "Okay, let’s talk outside.",
        "What’s the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler’s!",
        "(pause as she considers it) Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?",
        "Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don’t know what the big deal is!",
        "(gasps) My God! What did you order?!",
        "Look, why don’t you just pay for it yourself?",
        "(reading the slip of paper) Wow! (In a sultry voice) Hello, Mr. Chandler.",
        "Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.",
        "(entering) Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!",
        "My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.",
        "He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.",
        "Well, he’s never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!",
        "Oh, it’s my fault?! You didn’t have to massage him! You could’ve sent him away! You could’ve not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!",
        "I don’t know. I don’t know. I can’t lie to him again. Oh no I—no! I’m just gonna press my breasts up against him.",
        "Uh-huh, yeah that’s right.",
        "What? You mean behind my back?",
        "Oh, that’s great!!",
        "(gasps) Oh God!",
        "Oh hey!",
        "Ahhh!!",
        "(To Monica) Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.",
        "Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don’t hire an assistant because they’re cute, you hire them because they’re qualified.",
        "Let’s see. (Looking at the picture) Oh my God! Oh… But no! No! You can’t-you can’t hire him, because that—it’s not professional. Umm, this is for me (The picture) yes? Thanks. (Puts it in her pocket.)",
        "Hey—Ooh, how’s Hilda? Is she working out?",
        "Sorry.",
        "What happened?",
        "You! An actor?! That’s madness!",
        "Hi!",
        "You must be Hilda.",
        "Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number.",
        "So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?",
        "But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.",
        "So what do you guys want for an engagement present?",
        "Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.",
        "You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?",
        "You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?",
        "Break my heart—Oh, all right.",
        "If you don’t sail your boat, what do you do on it?",
        "Your own boat?",
        "I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!",
        "(pauses as he figures out how to answer that) Because I’m normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.",
        "Okay, here I wish you health and happiness. (She hands Monica a cookie in a plastic baggie.)",
        "See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.",
        "Why not?",
        "Really?!",
        "You do?",
        "That and arrogance.",
        "No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!",
        "I can’t believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother’s legacy is this crumb. (She picks it up with her finger and holds it out to Monica.) I wish you a long and happy marriage.",
        "Come on, it’s not that big a deal!",
        "Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?",
        "Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.",
        "Are there any more from the good batch? ‘Cause we could just work off of those.",
        "Y’know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we’re trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she’s l-l-lookin’ up at us and smiling right now.",
        "Oh yeah—No, she was really nice to me, but she’s in hell for sure.",
        "Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that’s not happening ‘til October 15th, 2032.",
        "That’s what you think.",
        "Well, y’know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.",
        "Nesele Toulouse.",
        "Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.",
        "(reading the recipe on the back of the bag) Yes!! (Realizes.) Oh.",
        "I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why (Looking down) you’re burning in hell!!",
        "Oh Willie’s still alive!",
        "Oh my God! That’s the creep that you’re with at the Statue of Liberty.",
        "Hey, why don’t you guys go get portraits done by a professional photographer.",
        "Yeah that’s great! Next to that, Chandler won’t look so stupid.",
        "(returning) Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out!",
        "He is! But he’s getting divorced—Ross! Maybe you know him.",
        "You don’t have to be back for a half-hour!",
        "So you wouldn’t mind if he was dating someone else?",
        "I’m having a really good time!",
        "Ohh. No that’s okay, he’s a friend.",
        "Yeah, I… Well y’know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I’d just be lost.",
        "Okay, don’t freak out. I’ll go.",
        "Okay, I know. Hold on. (She walks over to the couch.) Hey Ross?",
        "Yeah, umm that’s Whitney (Points), Kyle’s ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can y’know divert her so that we can slip out?",
        "Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals. (She holds up the tickets that Kyle gave her.)",
        "Hi Ginger.",
        "I don’t have it!",
        "Ugh, okay Sherlock! (Hands over the key.)",
        "All right, well I just wanted to say thank you though, for diverting Kyle’s ex.",
        "Okay.",
        "(To Ross) Kyle’s ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her, not date her!",
        "Watching ballroom dancing?",
        "Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.",
        "Like she’s really mean, and she’s over critical, and-and—No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!",
        "And! She uses s*x as a weapon!",
        "You’re still gonna go out with her?!",
        "Well, didn’t you just hear what I said?!",
        "(interrupting him) No listen to me! She is crazy!",
        "You see? Nothing is good enough for her!",
        "Hi.",
        "So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?",
        "Yeah well, maybe she should’ve spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.",
        "You think he’s emotionally unavailable?",
        "Well, maybe he wouldn’t be if she didn’t bring the office home every night!",
        "Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year’s Eve 1997.",
        "(gets up and starts to leave) We want the last six years back!!",
        "Oh, I’m sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how’s Whitney?",
        "Oh he knows! (Quietly) For the most part.",
        "Both of you together?",
        "What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!",
        "Oh right, because you’re so capable of change.",
        "Yeah, and y’know what? I don’t give a tiny rat’s ass.",
        "Oh. Y’know, he hums while he does other stuff to.",
        "And y’know, even if they break up again, you’d better not let him in your sad men’s club!",
        "Potato, Potaato. (She’s pronounces potato with the both the short and long As.)",
        "Ooh, let’s see it!",
        "You guys make a very attractive couple. (The camera cuts to a shot of the picture and we see that Monica is posing with Joey instead of Chandler.)",
        "I hope it’s you.",
        "Yes!!! Oh!!",
        "Still.",
        "Yeah, I’ll do that. So who gets to be yours?",
        "Wh-why is that the best part?",
        "Aww, and good luck to you too! (To Monica and Rachel) What a nice lady!",
        "Hey Rachel?",
        "Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?",
        "Uh-hmm.",
        "Oh! Well, if that’s what you want…",
        "But why does it even matter?!",
        "Because this one is now! And-and it’s two of our best friends! Who knows what you’re gonna marry!",
        "(gasps) You wouldn’t! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I’ve never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you’ve done it at least twice!",
        "And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. (Rachel stops talking.) Oh I guess that was it.",
        "Oh, thank you so much! (They hug.) Okay.",
        "Oh I know.",
        "See? This is exactly why you shouldn’t lie!",
        "Na-uh, I am!",
        "Because I cared enough to lie!",
        "What are you talking about?",
        "Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?",
        "(To Rachel) Well, it’s better than us deciding.",
        "No! Coins hate me!",
        "Hey there, you handsome thing. (Rachel and Phoebe exit.)",
        "Ugh, what a kiss ass.",
        "Yes! Your honor?",
        "Oh!",
        "Hey! Do you want, do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!",
        "Okay, I can’t believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this today with Rachel while we were showering together, naked. (Raises her glass and drinks.)",
        "Really?! I won!",
        "The coins have finally forgiven me!",
        "(running after her) Rach, it’s gonna be okay! (To Ross and Joey) You guys are the best!",
        "Hi!",
        "That’s ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. (Rachel looks at her.) Oh, you mean today.",
        "Oh yeah!",
        "Oh that’s so sweet thanks.",
        "Ohh.",
        "This stuff is great!",
        "Y’know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica’s maid of honor.",
        "Because I think it means more to you.",
        "It's fine. I mean, this is something that you’ve been thinking about since you were what, 14? (She’s referring to the Halloween picture.)",
        "(looking at the picture again) Man alive!",
        "Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.",
        "His first big kid’s bike, this is so exciting!",
        "I never had a bike of my own.",
        "Well, we didn’t have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.",
        "No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front. (They’re all speechless) So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.",
        "Not really, I got to drag him around too! (They all nod, \"Oh.\")",
        "Yeah, and they’ve been coming by all day. They love it!",
        "Sure!",
        "(gasps) Oh my God Ross!!",
        "I love it!!",
        "Ohh!! Ohh!! And I love you!",
        "Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!",
        "Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I’ve ever gotten.",
        "(starts to leave, but stops) Oh and Chandler’s about to cry.",
        "Oh hi!",
        "Ohh, uh-huh so much!",
        "Of course!",
        "Okay. (The gang is giggles then as Phoebe gets the bike out of the rack, gets on, pushes off, rolls a few feet, and falls over.) See?",
        "(hopping off the bike) Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat—or a beanbag chair!",
        "Why? Why do I have to learn?",
        "What kind of an emergency?",
        "Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.",
        "You won’t let go?",
        "Swear?!",
        "(thinks it over) Okay.",
        "All right.",
        "Well…",
        "Okay. (Does so.)",
        "Okay.",
        "Weee!!! (Ross pushes her and lets go.)",
        "Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!",
        "I am shocked! Shocked!! (She storms off leaving Ross to defend himself from the angry looks from onlookers.)",
        "(seeing him) Oh, hello liar.",
        "I could’ve been killed I hope you know!",
        "Well, I would love to but…the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects. (Ross just happens to have his hand on a sheet that is covering something that suspiciously looks like a bike.)",
        "What?! (Ross rings the bell.) What the hell?!",
        "What?! Why?!",
        "All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.",
        "(sarcastically) Okay Ross! (Ross exits and she says quietly to the bike) Please don’t die!",
        "I can’t believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I’d be able to do that! Thank you Ross.",
        "Don’t be so corny Ross, it’s not an after-school special. (She rides off and the camera pans down to reveal two shiny, silver training wheels firmly attached.)",
        "Okay!",
        "And call me!",
        "We want you to marry her!",
        "She is so amazing! You have no idea.",
        "Joey, she’s so cool. She speaks four languages.",
        "Yeah, but you always say that.",
        "Whatever.",
        "Secret affair!",
        "(entering with Erin) Oh. Hey!",
        "Oh no.",
        "Hey!",
        "Yay!! Oh so, you’re not, you’re not mad at us anymore?",
        "Didn’t you sleep together?",
        "Then change it back!",
        "No spark? Didn’t you sleep together?",
        "Does Joey have any idea?",
        "Yeah, you mean like that you’re kind of a loner.",
        "Yeah, and maybe that you’re a real (She says something in Italian, and it doesn’t matter what she said. It’s not important so I don’t need everyone who speaks Italian telling me what she said.)",
        "Oh well, I guess Italian isn’t one of the four languages you speak.",
        "No, just a regular old flying dwarf.",
        "Hey!",
        "So how was, how was your date?",
        "Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?",
        "Hey Joey, y’know what? You are way too good for her.",
        "(entering carrying a skull) Hey!",
        "Haaaa... (Puts the skull on the table) ... ahhhh!",
        "Huh?",
        "Oh, yeah, it's my mom's.",
        "No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people still die. And, you can put candy in it. (She grabs the skull, pulls out a stick of licorice, and takes a bite.)",
        "And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.",
        "(entering) Oh, hey, you guys!",
        "Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out.",
        "Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.",
        "Yeah, why not?",
        "Why do you think she's having so much fun living with Joey?",
        "Really? So she said, she didn’t wanna live with me anymore?",
        "You're sure? You're absolutely sure?",
        "Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. (Chandler and Monica look surprised) Kind of what ‘probably’ really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, \"Your mom probably won't kill herself,\" y’know? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on \"Probably!\" Y’know? You gotta take care of yourselves! (She starts to walk out) In this world history teaches us nothing! (Exits)",
        "So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y’know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!",
        "That's fun. (She exits disappointedly.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey! (she sits down next to him)",
        "Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.",
        "Maybe on some level.",
        "(entering with an aquarium covered by a towel) Hey, Joey, I got you another present. (She puts it on the counter)",
        "It's a…tarantula! (Joey almost falls down from his drum-stool jumping up) Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?",
        "(sarcastic) Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here. (She turns around, about to leave)",
        "Our apartment is ready.",
        "Because you would rather live here with Joey.",
        "Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.",
        "Hm?",
        "(nods along) Fish!",
        "Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here…",
        "We did have fun, didn't we?",
        "Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.",
        "Yay, okay!",
        "Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.",
        "Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they’ve made so many changes I can’t even feel my grandmother’s presence anymore—Ooh! New sconces!",
        "What?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Oh no! (She runs to see.) (Running back, excitedly) Oh! Wow!!!",
        "Well, I guess we’ll just have to put the wall back up.",
        "There’s a skylight?! (Runs to see and yells from the bedroom.) Wow!!",
        "(returning slowly) Y’know I’m-I’m sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.",
        "A little bit, yeah.",
        "You heard her too?! You have the gift!",
        "Are you sure?",
        "Oh me too.",
        "No, I do not hear that.",
        "Oh.",
        "Oh.",
        "Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny’s funeral?",
        "Shhhh!",
        "Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of celery, and I have one: regular celery.",
        "Regular Celery! (Starts to write that on her list) Oh, I already have that. (She gets up and heads for her room)",
        "Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.",
        "Oh, it's not!",
        "It's just my knitting that's all! (A dog sticks its head out of Phoebe's bag. Everyone looks puzzled.) Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.",
        "(answering the phone) Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?",
        "I'm sorry, who's this?",
        "No, there's no dog here?",
        "Oh my god! Where are you? (Looks around.)",
        "(Phoebe hangs up and someone knocks on the door. She gasps.) They're here already? How are they doing this?",
        "There's no dog in here.",
        "No that's just me coughing! (Doing some weird coughing noises and the dog barks again. Phoebe comes out of the room.) Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.",
        "Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. (She bends down, picks up the dog, and waves with one of its paws) Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?",
        "That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days",
        "Why?",
        "Are you crazy?",
        "Why?",
        "You don't like ice cream?",
        "All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross’s. We'll be back in a minute. (Gets up with Monica to do so.)",
        "Oh, I'd say about a month.",
        "(doing Clunkers) Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.",
        "Yeah, okay.",
        "You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.",
        "I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.",
        "Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?",
        "Where's Chandler?",
        "Wash your hands!!!",
        "(interrupts him) No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.",
        "See, this is exactly what we do not have time for. (She rushes into her room)",
        "(opens her bedroom door and peeks out) Hey, is Chandler here?",
        "Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look who's back!",
        "Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!",
        "(interrupts her, to Monica) Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.",
        "We have good news, look who's back!",
        "It's a Thanksgiving miracle!",
        "Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in…(Realizes, that Chandler starts to not believe her) I went too far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?",
        "(looking up) There it is! Oh, look at that! Isn’t Mother Nature amazing?",
        "Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that’s pretty amazing too.",
        "Oh! I won’t say, ‘no’ to a movie!",
        "Shh! Get me out of here.",
        "(crossing her fingers and closing her eyes) Please don’t be a space ship. Please don’t be a space ship. (She turns on the light and looks around and finds that it’s the smoke detector that’s beeping.) Oh thank God! (She moves a chair over and starts to investigate how to make the beeping turn off, in frustration she yanks the thing off of the wall. She sets it down and heads for bed, just as she gets there it beeps again. She opens the cover and removes the battery, but it still beeps.) How could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can…",
        "Don’t interrupt me!!",
        "Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. (She points at each as she says it.) Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to do… (She picks up a shoe and proceeds to pummel the smoke detector. She then gets up and heads to bed, stops, quickly turns around, and is satisfied that the beeping has stopped.) Well done, Pheebs. (She resumes her trek to bed, but is stopped at the entrance to the hallway by the now steady and extremely loud tone emanating from the smoke detector.) (Yelling.) What do you want from me?!!!!!!!",
        "Okay, this is where you and I part ways. (She drops the blanket into the chute.) Noisy bitch!",
        "Oh my God! How did you get back here?!",
        "(scared) Fire alarm? (She opens the door to reveal a fireman holding the blanket with the smoke detector.) Oh! Hi, officer—fireman, can-can I help you?",
        "That’s not mine.",
        "How do you know?",
        "Okay do you—Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!",
        "Fine! (She takes the blanket.) But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!",
        "There’s a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! (He exits and she goes to shut it off.) There’s a reset button! My God! Why didn’t I see that! (She takes off the plastic cover and looks for the button.) Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button? (Finds it.) Oh here it is! (Picks it up off of the floor.) Oh! (She presses it hard, but of course it would help if the button was still attached to the detector. In frustration she presses it so hard it causes pain in her thumb.) Ohh, God!",
        "Absolutely!",
        "Okay. (Joey exits.)",
        "Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.",
        "Duly noted.",
        "Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!",
        "Well, I’ll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note. (Hands it to Rachel.)",
        "Oh that’s a nickname we were trying out.",
        "Oh! Here’s Joseph Francis!",
        "So what?! That doesn’t give you the right to ditch me!",
        "I don’t accept this rule. When we make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can’t just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better! Y’know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this (Motions that their friendship) is for life!",
        "Well, it does.",
        "Okay, you wore me down.",
        "(gasps) (whispering) Oh my God! That’s David!",
        "David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!",
        "Oh, you say someone’s name enough, they turn around.",
        "David! (He kisses her cheek) What-what are you doing here? Aren’t you supposed to be in Russia?",
        "Well… Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Well, of course I would want to see you. I…I think about you all the time.",
        "Really?",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Yeah.",
        "(excited) Yes! Oh no!",
        "I can’t. I can’t believe I have plans, I can’t. Can you do it tomorrow night though?",
        "Uh-huh. (They go over and talk.)",
        "Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.",
        "No he won’t. And that’s not even the point! Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y’know what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don’t have my principles, I don’t have anything!",
        "Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!",
        "Hey!",
        "Yes! I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and water’s fine.",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh Joey, we’ve heard the specials three times! Okay? There’s prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli. (She grabs his menu and hands it to the waiter.)",
        "Huh?",
        "(checking her watch) Yeah, I’m very wise. I know.",
        "What?",
        "God Joey, this is taking forever!",
        "W-w—I just—it’s that—I have—y’know I have-I have an appointment. And it’s very important.",
        "Well… It’s a date.",
        "Come on Joey, don’t make me feel badly about this.",
        "That—It’s not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he’s very special to me.",
        "She was?",
        "Okay, whatever. Y’know what? I don’t have time to convince you because he’s only here for four hours, and I’m gonna go see him! (Gets up and leaves.)",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yeah! (She exits.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, I wouldn’t miss this.",
        "Oh, you’re such a gentleman. (Grabs his arm.) Come on! We’re going to my place! (Drags him off to her place.)",
        "Are you sure? I’ll bet there’s another flight to Minsk in like…",
        "That’s really beautiful. What does it mean?",
        "That’s good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.",
        "You’re right! You’re right. Don’t say it.",
        "I do too. (They kiss.)",
        "(seeing him) Okay, now’s not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.",
        "No I’m not okay. The only guy I’ve ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never…I may never see him again. (Crying.)",
        "Oh right, like they’re gonna let me have a passport.",
        "Well—But—Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y’know before he does, then he can come back. (They hug again.)",
        "What? What happened to the window in the attic?!",
        "I can’t believe I still don’t know what happened to the window in the attic!",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "Ugh, I hate this year!",
        "Well okay, it’s already February and I’ve only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!",
        "Oh that’s right!",
        "Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y’know, I probably wouldn’t have to say spank as much. (Monica and Ross are shocked.)",
        "Oh yeah, like you never called!",
        "Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.",
        "Oh okay. Umm, all right. (Picks up the phone and starts reading from the script.) Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?",
        "Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.",
        "Oh okay, well I’m sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. (Hangs up the phone.) Yeah you’re right, this is easy.",
        "Oh well, all right…um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.",
        "Oh.",
        "No. (Pause) Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?",
        "(on phone) Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please? (Listens) Earl, thanks. (Listens) Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies I’d like to talk to you about your toner needs. (She’s reading from the script.)",
        "I’m hearing what you’re saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner.",
        "May I ask why?",
        "I surely do!",
        "(doesn’t have any luck) Umm, is-is that because you’re out of toner?",
        "No-no wait-wait! I can’t just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.",
        "Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?",
        "Chandler?",
        "No look, I-I’m sure that people know you exist!",
        "Earl, you’re not hearing me! All I’m saying is that you’re not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with! (One of her coworkers overhears that, and she mimes that she didn’t mean him.)",
        "Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.",
        "All right so Earl, let’s just forget about the people at the office, okay? There-there’s gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?",
        "Oh sorry, boyfriend!",
        "No, whatever! Anything!",
        "Yeah, he’s gotta go.",
        "No! I’m not finished yet! Don’t! Don’t you dare hang up on me!!!",
        "(to Marge) Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He’s the supply manager around here.",
        "(goes over to his desk) Earl! I’m Phoebe.",
        "Umm, look it, you-you can’t kill yourself.",
        "No-no I can’t! I can’t let you do it!",
        "Because it was fate that made me call you today!",
        "No! Think about it okay? This isn’t even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job, you’re my first call! And-and somebody else might’ve hung up on you, but I wouldn’t do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself.",
        "Yes.",
        "I’m not gonna give you tips! Look don’t you see that this-this…this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.",
        "No, it’s fate!",
        "Oh. Well umm, okay here’s a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.",
        "Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.",
        "Sure! (Thinks.) Umm, where are you from?",
        "Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I’ve got-I’ve got goose bumps. (She holds out her arm.)",
        "Well, y’know I’m wearing layers and it’s warm.",
        "But if—no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!",
        "Y’know, I don’t-I don’t think it’s you. This is a freaky place. (To All) Hey! Guys! (Everyone looks up.) (To Earl) Oh no, it’s you.",
        "Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!",
        "Yeah, but you shouldn’t compare yourself to me.",
        "I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That’s it!! That’s everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay!! (They all cheer again.) And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean. (Rachel and Monica look intrigued and as they all head into Central Perk, Rachel picks up the hippity-hop that Phoebe left behind.)",
        "Oh, well get in line missy. (To Ross) So, can I have a ride stud?",
        "(getting out) Okay, who’s next?",
        "Really?! ‘Cause y’know that hurts.",
        "Least of all you.",
        "(running up) Okay. Okay, here’s what we’re gonna do. Okay, I’m gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right, here we go. (She opens her coat and reveals that thing car thieves use to break into cars as Ross jumps in behind the wheel. She inserts the device, unlocks the door, opens it, and the alarm goes off.) Haul ass!!!! (Runs off.)",
        "Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! (Hands her the hippity-hop.) It’s for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!",
        "Because it’s our thirtieth birthday.",
        "Wait! (Knocks on the door and Ursula opens it.)",
        "Yeah. What?!",
        "Nu-uh!",
        "You have your birth certificate?",
        "Our mom.",
        "Do you have my birth certificate?",
        "(reading the certificate) Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31.",
        "I just lost a whole year of my life.",
        "Your middle name is Pamela?",
        "Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?",
        "That’s my first name.",
        "Hey, what’s going on?",
        "Yay! I love drunk Monica!",
        "Ohh! All right! All right. Here’s what we’ll do, I’ll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one will even notice her.",
        "Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.",
        "If you could do that, I’d marry the hippity-hop.",
        "(clinking two glasses together) Speech! Speech! Let’s hear from the birthday girl! Huh?",
        "Don’t you see? Everyone’s looking at me! The plan’s working! I didn’t even have to take off my top yet!",
        "(screaming) Wooo!! Hoo!!",
        "(To Joey) Okay quick, help me get this off! (Motions to her top.)",
        "I lost a whole year! I can’t believe it! This is so unfair!",
        "Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?",
        "Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I…I haven’t done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!",
        "Like okay I-I-I, I haven’t met any Portuguese people! I, I haven’t had the perfect kiss! And I haven’t been to sniper’s school!",
        "No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I’ll see you guys later. Thanks. (Gets up and exits.)",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "Oh! (Phoebe walks away smiling.)",
        "You did the right thing.",
        "(Clears Throat) Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?",
        "Yeah? Why?",
        "Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there. (Pointing to an attractive man sitting at a table behind them.)",
        "(A woman with large breasts walks in the door) Ohh knockers will help us figure it out. (She walks by and he checks her out.)",
        "Ohh, he left his cell phone.",
        "Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.",
        "Yeah… That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone. (They both get up.)",
        "I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.",
        "That wasn’t a date! That was, that was just friends getting together…(quietly) having s*x.",
        "No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.",
        "Nice try.",
        "I don’t know.",
        "Ah-ha! Too cocky!",
        "Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.",
        "(handing Rachel the phone) Fine all right, but I’d bet you’d be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.",
        "Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.",
        "Did I use that already today? I’m sorry.",
        "Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that’s one for you.",
        "So you don’t know that’s Barney’s the store! That can be y’know his friend’s house, or a bar. Who has Barney’s the store on their speed dial?",
        "Hi!",
        "Good.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah!",
        "Ooh, now you lost me.",
        "No I didn’t!",
        "No. Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag. (Rachel dials her phone and Phoebe’s bag starts to ring.) Oh, it does work! (Rachel grabs the phone and takes it out of Phoebe’s handbag.)",
        "That is a different phone.",
        "That is damning evidence.",
        "(on phone) Hello? (Listens) Yes, I’m the one who found your phone.",
        "(To Rachel) Shhh! I’m on a call! (On phone) Umm well yeah, you can pick it up tonight, say 8:30? At-at my apartment. It’s umm, it’s umm 5 Morton Street, Apartment 14, umm and then maybe y’know after we can grab a bite to eat or whatever. (Listens) Okay, well okay I’ll see you then. (Listens) Bye. (Hangs up.)",
        "Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?",
        "Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just…be alone y’know to think about my mom and her suicide.",
        "What?! That’s the first time today!",
        "Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?",
        "Because it’s my apartment!",
        "Okay. All right. (Hands her the phone.) Good luck explaining all the calls to China.",
        "(To Rachel) Wow! How long were we arguing for?",
        "Could you-could you umm, give us one second?",
        "Wh-what do we do?",
        "Can you believe this? (Rachel exhales in amazement.) We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!",
        "Hmm, they just don’t make ‘em like that anymore!",
        "Rachel, listen—I mean, if you let me have him then I will really owe you one.",
        "Yeah! You’re such a great friend!",
        "Oh that’d be me. Sir. (Hands him the cell phone.) After you.",
        "(whispering) Nice!",
        "Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!!",
        "(returning with Joey) With what?",
        "Oo! You should have one of us do it!",
        "No! No! It’s-it’s uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!",
        "Yes! A friend of mine did it and it’s totally legal!",
        "What?! No! It was my idea!",
        "Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache!",
        "Oh my God, you’ve got to stop chattering!",
        "What is it?",
        "Oh no, I don’t believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here. (She’s pinching the bit of skin between her right thumb and forefinger with her left hand.) Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks. (Takes the pills.)",
        "Oh.",
        "It’s amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?",
        "Oh, I love you Hexadrin! (She kisses the box.) Oh look! It comes with a story! (She pulls out the instructions and side effects paper.)",
        "Say what?",
        "Oh my God! (Starts reading them.) Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache—Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don’t recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I’m sorry, extra strength death capsules!",
        "Why?",
        "I have liver damage. Ow! Oh! (She grabs the left side of her torso.)",
        "Okay, then I must be disoriented.",
        "I feel like my face is swelling. (To Monica) Is my face swelling?",
        "Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one! (Holds up the warning label.)",
        "Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?",
        "Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side effects!",
        "Yeah, it’s totally meant to be. (To Monica) Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.",
        "(To Joey) What?!",
        "I know! Robin is so gay!",
        "I’m really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two (Points to Monica and Joey) actually had hooked up.",
        "(still reading the label) Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! (Checks her watch) That’s it! I’m out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!",
        "Oh, it’s like a huge weight has been lifted! ‘Cause look, (reads the side effects) no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I’m just so happy! Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria—Oh.",
        "I like our way. Oh! (Grabs a piece and jumps a bunch of Joey’s like in Checkers.) Chess!",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?",
        "What is this? What’s going on?",
        "Joey’s!",
        "(laughs) Yeah, I’m sure that happened.",
        "Sure!",
        "(To Joey) Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.",
        "Okay! I just—I didn’t know that you are a lesbian. (Joey smiles and nods lewdly.)",
        "Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you’re so—y’know so…vanilla.",
        "Yeah.",
        "To Ross.",
        "Okay! All right! Yeah! ‘Cause I just can’t picture it.",
        "Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.",
        "Yeah! Y’know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.",
        "Really?!",
        "Oh, somewhere Joey’s head is exploding.",
        "Rachel, it’s okay. You don’t have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.",
        "I know.",
        "I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.",
        "I’ve had better.",
        "Since when are you into swing music?",
        "What is your job?",
        "(wearing a veil) Am I crazy or does this totally go?!",
        "(To Rachel) Thank you Rachel but, look at Monica!",
        "Ooh, is that spelled with a ‘C’ or a ‘K’? Oh my God! It doesn’t matter; they’re both great!",
        "Got it.",
        "(coming back out) Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!!",
        "(hearing the signal) I’m coming! I’m coming! (She takes off towards the signal and almost knocks another woman over.)",
        "Okay! (Runs that way and hears another whistle blast.) Hey! (Heads the other way and hears another blast.) What do I do?!! (She runs in the second direction and finds that the whistling is coming from inside a rack. She moves the dresses out of the way to find Rachel curled up in a fetal position frantically blowing on the whistle.) What are you doing? (Rachel doesn’t stop.) Did you find the dress? (Rachel won’t stop so Phoebe pinches her nose shut which causes her to spit the whistle out.)",
        "Did you find the dress?",
        "I—We gotta get Monica. (She starts to leave.)",
        "Oh my God!! (She grabs Rachel’s hand and drags her towards Monica.) Excuse me! Excuse me! (She’s knocking women and veils out of the way as she moves.)",
        "I know. Hand me a tissue. (Monica hands her one.)",
        "What?!",
        "(gasps) Does that mean Carcass is available?",
        "Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.",
        "Yeah, swing music is so out.",
        "Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y’know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts—They just stop living.",
        "Oh my God! (Joey looks at her.) I’m sorry, too soon. You go.",
        "Good for you!",
        "Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!",
        "Go for it.",
        "I’m just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and can’t perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.",
        "I did, but that was really fun.",
        "Oh hey!",
        "Oh, great! We couldn’t keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y’know, he’d kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck. (Does that to Monica.)",
        "(laughs) All I could think of was y’know, \"Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?\"",
        "I’m a lady Monica, I don’t kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself. (She starts to open up her blouse.)",
        "I just like him so much that I just feel like I’ve had 10 drinks today and I’ve only had six.",
        "You sound like a guy.",
        "You’ll have a last kiss.",
        "Okay bye. (They kiss.)",
        "Bye! (Phoebe goes over and joins Monica on the couch.) We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.",
        "(yelling back) I miss you too!!!! (He walks away.)",
        "No. Why?",
        "Okay, don’t sweat it. (Looking around her.) Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy’s cute. (Points to a guy sitting behind Monica.)",
        "No that is the last thing you want to do!",
        "Because you’re marrying him!",
        "All right, I’ve never been engaged and I’ve never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.",
        "That is correct! Yes, you’re supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.",
        "Yes!",
        "Oh my God! You’re right! Go! (Monica starts to leave.) Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it’s too late! Wait no! (Monica stops.) Does this also mean putting out doesn’t get you love? (Monica is shocked.)",
        "Rach?",
        "Oh. (Picks it up.) It’s just so unexpected! I…I uh…Boy I’ll tell you it’s just such an honor to be nominated for a Nobel Prize and y’know to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tony award for best actress in…",
        "…in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon. (To an imaginary Neil Simon) Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words. (Blows him a kiss.)",
        "Please, don’t play the music. Just uh one more. LIVE FROM NEW YORK! IT’S SATURDAY NIGHT!!",
        "(To Joey) Oh hey! How was your audition?",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Oh! You got it?!",
        "The next next?",
        "What’s the matter?",
        "Grandma’s gonna have to get in line.",
        "Hey, the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?",
        "Sure.",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah!",
        "What?!",
        "Well, when can we have this shower?",
        "Well that’s only two days away. What is the other option?",
        "Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We’re done!",
        "Rachel, calm down!",
        "(grabs and shakes Rachel) Just calm down woman!",
        "Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.",
        "Uh, here. What time?",
        "Finger sandwiches and tea.",
        "And chili!",
        "Both!",
        "Neither.",
        "Lusts of the flesh.",
        "I don’t know. (Timidly) A cowboy theme?",
        "Hey! I’ve got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone’s names in them and inside is everyone’s individual birth stone.",
        "Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that’s coming? Me. Are you?",
        "Hey!",
        "Okay but look! Look at what I got! It’s her address book! (Holds it up.) We have a guest list!",
        "Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party. (Holds up $40.)",
        "Hi!",
        "How are you? (The woman nods) Good. (She goes over to another couple of women.) Hi, thanks for coming.",
        "Thank you. (To the other woman) No? (She nods.) All right. (She goes to another pairing.) Oh, it’s so nice to see you.",
        "Okay. (Goes over to Rachel.) Hey Rach?",
        "Who the hell are all these people?",
        "Hmm, y’know there’s another word for people like that: Losers!",
        "You were supposed to tell her!",
        "Fine, I’ll go call her.",
        "And then for forgetting to invite you to it.",
        "Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and a bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.",
        "We ruined everything.",
        "Sur-surprise.",
        "Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?",
        "Oh! No problem! I… (Cassie emerges from the bathroom and we once again visit slow motion Barry White background music land with the sexy hair-flipping thing going on, only this time Phoebe is entranced. For more information on Denise Richards you can visit your local library or look her up on the Internet at her official website at www.deniserichards.com.)",
        "(in her head) Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! She’s not your cousin!",
        "What?!",
        "Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small. (Points.)",
        "Oh! Yeah! (Monica glares at her.)",
        "Well maybe you don’t talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about, y’know, all the things that he’s taught you. Like… (They all try to think about one example and don’t succeed.) Or all the things you taught him.",
        "Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.",
        "Hey!",
        "Well let’s just say its.. she’s lucky she has a sweet ass, ‘cause she’s not so good at the writing.",
        "Well let’s just hope it works. Y’know, nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?",
        "Yeah, you’re right. How’s the Mrs.?",
        "(looking out the window) Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! (Starts yelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothes off.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!",
        "(screaming) Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!",
        "CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!",
        "OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!",
        "NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!",
        "YOU KNOW?!!!",
        "(Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her and Rachel.)",
        "Okay, so now they know that you know, and they don't know that Rachel knows?",
        "Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own",
        "Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She pinches his butt.)",
        "I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!",
        "No!",
        "God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey, you can't say anything!",
        "He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.",
        "Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you didn’t rip off any buttons.",
        "Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is showcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra.",
        "You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now.",
        "Ooh.",
        "Here it comes. Our first kiss.",
        "And why not?!",
        "You're-you're what?!",
        "I just—I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!",
        "Y’know, you’re friend’s getting married, it’s gotta change things.",
        "How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having kids, and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they’re gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.",
        "Hey.",
        "Oh!",
        "Okay.",
        "(To Monica) Oh, that’s beautiful.",
        "Hey!",
        "I’ve never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time.",
        "Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding. (Rachel glares at her.)",
        "Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.",
        "Okay, I think I need to do some shopping. (Gets up and leaves.)",
        "Hey sweetie!",
        "Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica’s. I’ll be right back. (She goes to get it.)",
        "What? (He leans in to kiss her.) Oh. (They kiss and Phoebe pauses.) Ooh. (Pause) Whoa! That one kept going. (Exits.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Yeah!",
        "I know. They were mine.",
        "No, it’s not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.",
        "I’m wearing his briefs right now.",
        "I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.",
        "And! Y’know what Jake says? That women’s underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.",
        "There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I’m thinking even more than you.",
        "I’m just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women’s underwear! I don’t think you could ever do that.",
        "Okay, whatever.",
        "Hey!",
        "Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Huh.",
        "That’s great Joe!",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Hmm?",
        "I think it’s important that you do.",
        "Feel better?",
        "Yeah, I understand.",
        "Why?! What’s happening to the coffee house?! (Monica looks at her.) Oh! (Realizes.)",
        "What are they?",
        "That play?",
        "The movie?",
        "Ohh!",
        "Oh, yeah! Back then y’know, we called it the Great War. It really was!",
        "Congratulations!",
        "Go ahead.",
        "Yes! Very good.",
        "Ross, please! My make-up! (He walks away angrily.)",
        "(walking up) What’s up? (Rachel hands her the note and she reads it.) Tell Monica I’m sorry. (Pause) Tell her yourself!",
        "Oh my God! Chandler just left though!",
        "Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he’s changed his name, y’know? Tell Monica I’m sorry.",
        "Don’t be so negative! Good God! Isn’t it possible that Sorry is sitting in there (Joey and Rachel’s apartment) right now?!",
        "(pointing at Ross) Okay but if you don’t find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!",
        "Oh man.",
        "Okay. Well there’s one down.",
        "Y’know she might not even notice he’s gone.",
        "Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can’t do this here! (She drags her into the bathroom.)",
        "Yeah, but you’ve got to pull yourself together! Monica can’t see you like this! Then she’ll know something’s wrong!",
        "Yeah. (Looks.) Oh, that’s gone too. This is Monica’s bathroom right?!",
        "No-no! I-I…I found one.",
        "(looking into the trash can) Sure. (Reaching into the trash can.) Do you need some floss? (Grabs a piece of it.)",
        "Oh here’s a whole bunch.",
        "(finding something interesting in the trash can) Oh my God!",
        "There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it’s positive. Monica’s pregnant. (Rachel covers her mouth.) So I guess she won’t be totally alone.",
        "I know! Monica’s gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her something new?",
        "Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?",
        "Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is pregnant. The groom is missing. And I’m still holding this. (She throws the test back into the trash.)",
        "Right.",
        "Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?",
        "Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.",
        "You told them he was missing?",
        "Okay. I’m going with you.",
        "Ross, you’re tired. You’ve been looking all night. And clearly you suck at this.",
        "Okay. Wait, do you know how you’re going to stall her?",
        "All right. Good luck.",
        "Oh my God! Is that him? (She points at someone.)",
        "He could be in disguise, y’know.",
        "What the hell are you doing?!",
        "Why not?!",
        "But look Chandler, right now no-one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.",
        "(entering) Found the vest! I mean we’re gonna have to keep an eye on it, y’know make sure we don’t lose it again…",
        "So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?",
        "Oh my God Monica!",
        "(To Rachel) Wait! Maybe, maybe you’re overreacting! You do that y’know.",
        "Okay. Oh but don’t tell them Monica’s pregnant because they frown on that.",
        "Okay.",
        "Yeah!",
        "What’s going on?",
        "Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!",
        "Hey! Oh!",
        "You know?!",
        "What? You’ll hi-ya?",
        "Well you obviously didn’t see Chucky 3.",
        "What?",
        "Oh and they’re gonna have a baby.",
        "Okay. (Phoebe and Rachel join Monica and Chandler on the altar.) Hey Mon, why did you tell the guys you weren’t pregnant?",
        "We found your test in the trash, if you’re not pregnant—(She sees Rachel shaking her head)—It’s because I am.",
        "Yes, I…I am with child. (Flash) And I didn’t want to say anything because it’s your day; I didn’t want to steal your thunder.",
        "I can’t say.",
        "I can’t say because he’s famous.",
        "Okay, okay. It’s James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby.",
        "What?! Well he never said that to me!",
        "How about just the bridemaids?",
        "It is.",
        "Oh my God!",
        "So instead you told me Monica was pregnant.",
        "Sneaky.",
        "Uh-hmm.",
        "Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered he’s gay.",
        "(intrigued) Really?!",
        "So, are you ready to talk about it?",
        "Now?",
        "Okay, we’ll talk about something else then.",
        "Who’s the father?!",
        "Yeah. That’s fine. That’s fair. Is it Tag?",
        "Okay, I’m sorry. I’ll stop.",
        "Is it Ross? It’s Ross isn’t it—Oh my God, it’s Joey!",
        "Ah-hah! At least we know it’s a him.",
        "Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolin…",
        "Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would leave her for me. And I said, \"James, James Brolin, are you sure?\" James Brolin said…",
        "(shocked) What?! (deadpan) Why bother?",
        "Calm down. Maybe you’re not pregnant.",
        "When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure.",
        "I’m-I’m just saying, don’t freak out until you’re a hundred percent sure.",
        "I’ll run out and get you one.",
        "Oh no, she won’t tell us.",
        "See? This is why you register.",
        "30 seconds.",
        "It’s time.",
        "Okay.",
        "Umm, it’s negative.",
        "It’s negative.",
        "Here. (Gives Rachel a tissue.)",
        "No, it’s positive.",
        "It’s-it’s not negative, it’s positive.",
        "Well yeah, I lied before.",
        "Now you know how you really feel about it.",
        "With who?",
        "Oh! Joey uh, were you in our room last night?",
        "Hey!",
        "Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?",
        "A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman.",
        "Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "Okay.",
        "Well I guess it’s okay to open one more if it’s part of a set. Y’know, it’s probably this one. (Grabs another small one.)",
        "Yeah that’s right Chandler does still think I’m pregnant. He hasn’t asked me how I’m feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him. (Monica looks at her.) After you of course.",
        "Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor?",
        "What?! I think he’s cute.",
        "Believe me I’m trying.",
        "Yeah. You’re just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. You’re like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism.",
        "Pretty big? It’s huge! God, this guy doesn’t have a clue! He’s just walking down the street thinking, ‘I had s*x with Rachel Green. I rock!’ then bam! He’s a father and everything’s different.",
        "Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he’s walking around thinking, ‘Do I want to be a dad?’ and then bam!",
        "I don’t. He got…he-he-he-he’s hit by a bus.",
        "Oh yeah. That’s me.",
        "Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, I’m gonna have a baby! (Joey and Phoebe hug.)",
        "You don’t know him. It’s not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby. (She sits down like she’s pregnant.)",
        "David Lynn.",
        "Oh some guy from my gym. A little annoying.",
        "Hey! Ooh, did you do it yet?",
        "Oh, well what are you doing here? Are you about to do it? (Gasps) Is it Gunther?",
        "Thank God, ‘cause that hair on a baby…",
        "Why not?",
        "Bus?",
        "Well-well but it is huge.",
        "You’re thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it over with. It’s like, it’s like ripping off this Band-Aid. (On her arm) Quick and painless, watch. (Rips it off.) Oh mother of…See?",
        "(entering) Hey.",
        "All right. (She sits down like she’s pregnant again.)",
        "Hell yeah! I’ll marry you! (She grabs the ring and puts it on.)",
        "Hey lady, your day’s over! It’s my turn!",
        "I can and I will! (Kisses him.)",
        "Hey!",
        "It’s Joey! (Joey turns and looks at her and she mouths ‘I love you’ to him.)",
        "We don’t know.",
        "Who? Who is it?",
        "Was that story over?",
        "(gasps) Oh my God! I know who the father is… (She walks into Monica and Chandler’s.)",
        "Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go!",
        "I may play the fool at times, but I’m a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won’t quit. (She takes the sweater out of her purse.) I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.",
        "Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?",
        "Really? Are you sure?",
        "Okay, sorry. Yeah. (They go inside to confront the father.)",
        "Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater.",
        "Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or…poison? No? Just for me? Okay. (Walks away.)",
        "What?!!",
        "No!!",
        "I can’t say that didn’t hurt. But I’ll take you back Joey Tribbiani.",
        "Ooh! A Salami Buddy!",
        "Wait you stole those from these people’s wedding?",
        "Oh my God!!",
        "Yeah! Have a great honeymoon!",
        "It was his sweater, but—Oh my God!",
        "Me too! (Joins the hug.)",
        "Yeah, bye.",
        "Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.",
        "All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment. Well you can let me in later.",
        "What?! They took mine to give to you!",
        "Maybe they don’t trust us.",
        "You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monica’s guest towels?",
        "No you didn’t.",
        "Well, what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar!",
        "What stuff?",
        "Did Rachel find you?",
        "Oh she was looking for you.",
        "Well, she really wanted to talk to you now.",
        "What?",
        "(deadpan) And?",
        "Oh sorry. (Shocked) And?!",
        "(To Joey) Maybe it’s something you ate?",
        "Of course I do! And I’m gonna give it back to you as soon as they’re done with it at the key shining place.",
        "Well why don’t you use your key?",
        "Oh! We could have done that.",
        "Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and Monica about this? ‘Cause y’know umm, they don’t-they don’t have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.",
        "Oh no.",
        "Didn’t you two already talk?",
        "(simultaneously) Holy mother of God!!!",
        "That is brand new information!!",
        "A little bit.",
        "Oh Ross.",
        "Oh hey hi, he’s doing it. He’s breaking down the door. (The chair breaks in half.) Okay, we’re in. (She hangs up the phone.)",
        "Hey! So how was the doctor?",
        "Good.",
        "Oh.",
        "Hey!",
        "Dinner was good!",
        "I’m just saying hi! Now I’m gonna go!",
        "(To him) Oh, well hello there.",
        "(To Monica) I didn’t see this on the menu.",
        "Oh, so you're Monica’s boss?",
        "Oh! I sous stand.",
        "Oh you…you made pesto?",
        "Would you say your pesto is the best-o?",
        "I made it myself.",
        "Well, it’s no pesto.",
        "Ooh Monica!",
        "Oh my God! I had the best time with Tim last night. He is so sweet! Oh, I can’t wait to get sous-neath him.",
        "But why?!",
        "Well maybe he was just nervous, y’know you can be very intimidating. And besides I’ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.",
        "But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?",
        "That’s fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.",
        "Love it!",
        "Hey!",
        "But…",
        "Okay. Okay, but you can’t fire him today.",
        "Because I’m dumping him today.",
        "He is sweet. He’s too sweet. He calls me all the time. (Mimicking him) \"So did-did you get home from work okay?\" \"Did-did you get out of the shower okay?\"",
        "Then he comes over! (Mimicking him) \"I’m so worried about you.\" Uck! Be a man!",
        "You can’t fire him and dump him the same day, he’ll kill himself.",
        "Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I’ll kill myself!",
        "Okay. But the question is who’s gonna go first. ‘Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.",
        "Come on! The boss that fires a guy that’s just been dumped, bitch! And the woman who dumps a guy that’s just been fired, blond bitch!",
        "All right, that makes sense. (Starts towards the door.) Ugh. But—Screw you I’m going first! (She grabs her purse and runs out.)",
        "Hi.",
        "It will be…in a minute. Listen, Tim you’re a really great guy.",
        "Aw. (Phoebe gets a bad taste in her mouth when he looks away) I’m just—I’m in a place in my life right now where I…I…",
        "Oh-oh no she doesn’t! I know what that is. You can stay.",
        "Monica!",
        "(simultaneously) I’m breaking up with you!",
        "I’m, I’m breaking up with you.",
        "I’m sorry, I’m just—I’m…I’m just not ready for a relationship right now.",
        "Oh that’s good, the chemistry thing for us too.",
        "And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here. (Shakes his hand and leaves, which disgusts Monica.)",
        "Huh?",
        "Sure. Yeah, he’s kinda sexy.",
        "Okay so, we’ll just come up with some kind of signal if it’s going well you can take off.",
        "Oh. Why not?",
        "Oh Rachel, this is all so ‘Papa don’t preach.’",
        "Wow! Oh well, I will be there!",
        "Gosh. I’m not gonna let that man make you eat your baby. (They both sit down by the rest of the gang and Phoebe recognizes a man by the window.) Oh. Hey! Who is that guy? I think I know him.",
        "Oh my God!!! Monica!! He’s the stripper from your bachelorette party!!",
        "Your secret bachelorette party…",
        "She untied his G-string with her teeth. (Pause) Somebody stop me!",
        "Oh, I-I don’t eat meat.",
        "Yeah, I don’t eat that either.",
        "He’s right though, the ’74 is absolute piss.",
        "Rachel!",
        "Why, so he can get mad at the baby?",
        "It’s slang for pregnant.",
        "I’m sorry I won’t be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but I’m really busy that day. Yeah, I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.",
        "It’s Lafite. The ’74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.",
        "I’d better go. (She goes and sits down in the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000, the chair that Sit magazine called chair of the year, and they both look at her.) Just over here: I don’t want to miss the fight.",
        "That’s it?! You call that a fight? Come on! \"We were on a break!\" \"No we weren’t!\" What happened to you two?!",
        "(entering, quietly) Wow, you told your dad the truth.",
        "Wanna go see a movie?",
        "Oh good! (And there’s general excitement.)",
        "Now wasn’t Joey hitting on her at the wedding too?",
        "Ursula! (Ursula turns, smiles, and continues walking.) Wait! Err-err, it’s me! Phoebe!",
        "Wait a second! So, what’s new with you?",
        "What?!",
        "Huh. Okay. Well, I’m really happy for you. (Starts to walk away.)",
        "Really?",
        "Yeah. Okay. Umm, y’know, my friends are having a Halloween party tonight at my old apartment so, you could come. Maybe I could meet the guy you’re marrying.",
        "By the way, it’s a costume party.",
        "(looks down) No. But thanks. (Walks away.)",
        "Ah, Catwoman. So we meet again.",
        "No, it’s me. Phoebe!",
        "(To Chandler) That is so you!",
        "No wonder your pregnant.",
        "Okay, I will. But right after you tell me who the hell you are.",
        "Ursula’s fiancée?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "My mother killed herself.",
        "No-no! That’s okay, we’ll just start over. Okay? Hi! I’m Phoebe.",
        "Why are you looking at me like that?",
        "Okay. (Hands him a napkin.) So, what are you?",
        "(laughs) No I-I meant your costume.",
        "I love the second grade!",
        "Yeah! It’s so much better than first grade when you don’t know what’s going on and definitely better than third grade. Y’know with all the politics and mind games.",
        "Umm, I’m a masseuse…by day. (Stands with her hands on her hips like a Supergirl pose.)",
        "No I’m having fun. I’m really—And I’m really-really excited for you and Ursula.",
        "Thank you.",
        "(walking over) Hey. Ursula’s fiancée is really sweet! He’s a teacher, he does all this volunteer work. Y’know normally y’know, I don’t like really sweaty guys. But this one? I could just mop him up!",
        "What?",
        "No I’m not! You are!",
        "Hello handsome. (Sees Ursula over her shoulder) Oh God. (Walks away in shame as they kiss.) Oh look at you two. So when did you guys meet?",
        "Two weeks? That’s it?",
        "Oh really?",
        "Huh? (Ursula motions for Phoebe to keep quiet.)",
        "Peace Corps, really? (Ursula motions, \"I don’t know.\")",
        "Hi liar!",
        "Y’know the only reason he’s marrying you is because he thinks all the things you were saying about yourself were true.",
        "But they’re not!",
        "Why are you lying to him?",
        "You too. And Ursula?! It was really nice meeting you tonight!!",
        "Hmm?",
        "Oh.",
        "Sure it does. Yeah, yeah.",
        "Umm listen, I don’t think…I don’t think I’m gonna make it to the wedding. So I just want to wish you all the luck in the world.",
        "Okay I can’t let you do this! She’s lying to you.",
        "She is lying! And I bet I can prove it. Excuse me. (She grabs Ursula’s purse and starts going through it and finds some papers.) Okay. Okay. Yeah—Not a prayer chain, but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan. (Holds up her nametag.) Okay, here’s the nametag from the restaurant where she works as a waitress! Not a teacher, a waitress. All right, here’s her driver license, this oughta be good, she always lies about this. How old did she say she was?",
        "Oh, I almost don’t want to show this. (Hands it to him.) Just remember I’m a minute younger.",
        "No. You’re not, you’re not stupid.",
        "That’s good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic. Just…you did it with the wrong person. (He looks at her.) What?",
        "Yeah, you should. (They shake hands.)",
        "(looking around) Who’s cell phone is that? It’s just so annoying; everywhere you go.",
        "(checks) I never get calls!! (Answers the phone) Hello?",
        "Oh my God Eric hi! Wait, how’d you get this number?",
        "Wow! What an incredible violation—and wonderful surprise.",
        "Oh you did? (To Rachel) He did it! He did it!",
        "Shhh! I’m talking.",
        "Are you asking me out? ‘Cause it would be kinda weird since you just broke up with my sister.",
        "No! Wait! I was just saying that so you’d think I was a good person. Fight for me.",
        "Not great, but we can work on it at lunch. Okay, I can be at your apartment in two hours.",
        "I’ve got friends too. Okay, bye.",
        "Oh my God! I’m going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can’t make lunch. (Exits.)",
        "Hi!",
        "Yeah, me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though.",
        "Oh.",
        "Yeah. (Covers her face with her hand.) Yeah.",
        "Maybe this is too weird.",
        "No don’t tear out your eyes!!",
        "Oh, yeah try that. (He finishes and looks at her.) So, is that better?",
        "Look Eric, turn around. (He does so.) Look, I like you, but it shouldn’t be this hard. Y’know? This is our first date y’know? First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and ‘Ooh, he just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand?’ and y’know first kisses and…(He kisses her)…second kisses. (Motions for him to kiss her again which he does and they start to make out.)",
        "Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.",
        "No, I got in trouble for that before. I’ll see you later.",
        "Really? That’s the thing I’m worse at! You’ll see. (Exits.)",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Hey! (Jumps on the bed with him.) Can we pick up where we left off?",
        "Why?",
        "What s*x?",
        "We didn’t have s*x.",
        "(simultaneously as Eric) Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!",
        "You-you…you had s*x with Ursula?!",
        "You didn’t notice she was wearing different clothes?!",
        "Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y’know what? This is too weird.",
        "So I guess this is it.",
        "Yeah, so do you.",
        "How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?",
        "Ohh! Okay! Okay, cause when-when he said, \"I can’t wait to hear your first words,\" I thought, \"There’s a trick.\"",
        "Okay.",
        "Hey Ross! Doesn’t Ben go to the Smithfield Day School?",
        "Sting has a son that goes there too!",
        "You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?!",
        "Sting’s son, seven years old and there’s a picture.",
        "No, it’s New York magazine. It’s an article about the best schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting?",
        "Uh-huh, yeah that’s too bad. I really want to go to his concert Friday night, but it’s totally sold out. I know! Why don’t you meet him and get tickets?! If you get two I’ll take you.",
        "There you go! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting tomorrow! That’s why you have kids!",
        "Wow! They’re beautiful!",
        "What?!",
        "Well then get your money back and return them!",
        "Oh no! Why not?",
        "How come?!",
        "Wait! But Ross if they don’t get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends.",
        "Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!",
        "Your kid is seven?! (Ross nods, \"Yes.\") (To the rest) He’s really small. (To Ross) Please! Please get the tickets!",
        "Yes you can! Sting says so himself!",
        "(singing) Rosssss can!",
        "(singing) Rossss can!",
        "(singing) Rosss can! Give me the tickets! Ross can give me the tickets!!",
        "Oh, there you are Ben!",
        "Well, I heard you’re having a problem with one of the boys in your class. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay. Now umm, the boy’s name is Sting’s son.",
        "Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers.",
        "Him you’re friends with. (Starts looking at the children trying to find Jack and a teacher notices her.)",
        "Yes! Yes you can, I’m looking for Jack’s parents.",
        "Uh-huh, I’m with Ben.",
        "I am one of Ben’s mothers. I’m a lesbian. It was, it was difficult coming out to my parents.",
        "Oh.",
        "Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.",
        "Yeah! Let’s do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and talk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings. Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?",
        "Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? ‘Cause Carol threw it out, she lost ours. She’s such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass.",
        "Wow! This place is incredible! (Gasps) Sting’s pen…that he gave to Phoebe. (Puts the pen in her purse and goes over to a floor-to-ceiling bookcase) Come on! Secret passageway! (Starts pulling books at random as Trudie enters.)",
        "Hi!",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Why else would I be here?",
        "Uh-huh. (They go and sit down.)",
        "Yeah.",
        "Umm, I’m sorry. Won’t-won’t Jack’s father be joining us?",
        "Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday night perhaps at 8 o’clock?",
        "Concert. Yeah. That does put us in…quite a pickle. Because you see I’m very busy before and after the concert, and he’s obviously busy during.",
        "Unless! Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course.",
        "Oh, thank you. Four would be great.",
        "Oh good! Then you’re in luck! Ben’s not my son!",
        "The Police? Here? A reunion?! (She gets out her camera.)",
        "Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!",
        "Oo, where are the seats?",
        "Okay, now would you say that that’s more than 50 yards away from Sting, his wife, or a member of his family?",
        "Then that’s not breaking the law! I’m there!",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "I brought you my old maternity clothes! (Sets a bag on the counter.)",
        "Yeah! And look, (Grabs the pants) see how they expand as the baby grows? (There’s a stretchy part in front.) And then after the baby’s born, they’re great for shoplifting melons.",
        "Turkey’s are beautiful, intelligent animals!",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Happy Thanksgiving!",
        "Anything I can do to help?",
        "Sure!",
        "Okay. (She starts folding the napkins in half.)",
        "Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me. (Monica exits.) (To Chandler) So how’s the game?",
        "What?",
        "I don’t believe you! That is…brilliant! And Monica has no idea?",
        "Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I don’t think I can help you after all, I didn’t realize this game was on.",
        "Well normally I don’t, but y’know…(looks at the TV)…Green Bay is playing.",
        "Well it’s only like my favorite bay! {Actually, it’s not bad. It just gets a little cold in winter, but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August to June. J }",
        "(nonchalantly glancing) Hey. (Turns back around.) Wow! (Looks up.) Well done.",
        "Oh okay.",
        "Noooo!! Damn you ref! You burn in hell!!!",
        "Yeah.",
        "(simultaneously) Green Bay.",
        "Well the Lions technically won, but it was a moral victory for the Green Bay…Mermen.",
        "I think you do.",
        "What?! What else did you do?",
        "Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!",
        "Oh! (They all look.) Wow!",
        "So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?",
        "I wanna join!",
        "I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I never got to be in a club. I-I didn’t go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn French. Bonjour.",
        "Okay. (Goes over and hugs him.) It’s exactly how I’d imagined it would be.",
        "Joey! Those are my maternity pants!",
        "Is there anything we can do for you?",
        "Yeah?",
        "He’s awfully short and I think he’s talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he’s not that good in bed.",
        "Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?",
        "This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.",
        "Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, y’know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.",
        "Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a Foot Locker.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah. Yeah, that’s what you need a good…pill.",
        "(sitting down next to Ross) Y’know she has a face Ross!",
        "Bye.",
        "Wait, I’m-I’m sorry. What’s the big deal about a holiday card?",
        "Oh hey! So, how did your doctor’s appointment go?",
        "Oh my God.",
        "Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?",
        "You wish.",
        "Oh yeah? Come and get it.",
        "Ugh! Women!",
        "Give her a key to your apartment.",
        "No, we hate that.",
        "(entering with some guy) Hey. Ooh Ross! How’d the conversation go?",
        "Where?! (Ross exits.)",
        "Hi! Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger.",
        "So umm, I’m gonna get us some drinks. (To Rachel) Would you help me out?",
        "Umm, he’s here to have s*x with you.",
        "You’re welcome.",
        "It’s okay, he’s a virgin.",
        "Yeah, okay let’s leave these two alone.",
        "Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this! (Phoebe exits.)",
        "Hi. Listen, I’m sorry about that whole thing with Roger. It really wasn’t right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something that I think you’ll really enjoy. (Goes into the hallway and returns carrying the Evander Holyfield cutout.) Now, this is just a loan. Okay? I’m gonna, I’m gonna want him back. So… (Looks at him longingly) I’m gonna go now. (Exits.) (Pause) (Entering) I’m sorry, I thought I could do it and I can’t! (She grabs the cutout and exits for good.)",
        "Hey! I got you a present!!",
        "I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago, and it finally got here!",
        "It’s a Ms. Pac-Man machine!!",
        "I didn’t know where to put it so I just left it here for now.",
        "Do you really like it?",
        "Oh really? What was your first?",
        "No. No! Yes! Ahh. Oh, would you look at that Monica? I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.",
        "Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t hear you over all the winning.",
        "Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you, then maybe I should just keep it.",
        "Yeah! It’s not like it spits out a Clark bar after every game.",
        "(entering) Hey, you guys. Listen, I’m sorry that I was hogging the game before—(Sees the top ten list)—Oh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!",
        "Chandler sucks! He couldn’t have gotten this good!",
        "I know!",
        "Don’t touch me!!",
        "I can’t!! I can’t!! (She dies.) Noooooooo!!!!!!! You son of a bitch!!!!!",
        "Oh hi Ben—No!! Don’t look at the machine! (Covers the screen.)",
        "Hey, are you going to find out the s*x of the baby?",
        "Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking of names yet?",
        "Me too!",
        "Uh huh! If it’s a girl, Phoebe, and if it’s a boy, Phoebo!",
        "Yeah, by Sandrine.",
        "How-how about you each get five vetoes?",
        "I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!",
        "Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?",
        "(from outside the bathroom) You guys?",
        "Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Oh, just as well, I broke this one.",
        "What?",
        "Okay.",
        "Fine.",
        "Then it’s really too bad that you can’t tell me.",
        "(Groans) Is it Chandler?",
        "Well, then tell him to stop staring!",
        "Really?! Joey?! You don’t say.",
        "I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know. You know, I mean, on the one hand, Mother may I? But y’know on the other hand… No. No, I can’t. We’re friends. No, oh, no. I don’t want to risk what we have.",
        "Sure, yeah. I mean, it’s Joey. I don’t want him to get hurt. Well, I must say, I am on fire! First Chandler, now Joey!",
        "Sure.",
        "Hey.",
        "Umm, Joey, I know.",
        "I knooow.",
        "I know about your feelings.",
        "Yes, and I’m sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica, but that’s very rare.",
        "For God sakes, it’s Rachel!",
        "Yeah that’s Rachel. (To herself) Beat me over the head with it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Joey, I just think you’re getting worked up over nothing. This is probably just a crush.",
        "Absolutely! Y’know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away.",
        "That’s right, there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I know I’ve had them for all you guys. Well, except for Ross and Chandler. And I’m sure you’ve had them for us.",
        "Mm-hmm. (To herself) Throw me a bone here.",
        "Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey.",
        "Well, you were wrong, he doesn’t like me!",
        "Yeah! How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors’ house and told you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he didn’t like you? How would you feel?",
        "Really? Lee Majors is hot!",
        "We’re in the bathroom!",
        "(checking for herself) (To Monica) Mazel tov.",
        "Tell us what?",
        "Well, I left my guitar here again.",
        "Okay. (Monica closes the door, gets the guitar, and then hands it out.)",
        "Oh.",
        "Okay.",
        "Great! Umm…(Monica closes the door again and Phoebe knocks again.)",
        "So do you want to hang out or something?",
        "Oh are you and Chandler…",
        "Okay. Do you guys want me to play for you?",
        "You ask an intriguing question Chandler Bing.",
        "Oh my God! You’re getting a massage! You never let me massage you!!",
        "You told me you hate massages!",
        "I can’t believe this! How long as this been going on?",
        "Oh, it has a name?",
        "Okay—Oop! Too late! I’m leaving! Come on Chandler let’s go! (She storms out.)",
        "(entering) Hello Chandler, lovely day huh? (To Monica) You!",
        "Why won’t you let me massage you?",
        "Monica! We lived together for years! I’ve seen you naked!",
        "I’m curious about the human body.",
        "But I’m a professional! And I’m really good! Look, if you’re uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance, okay. Please?",
        "It does! How would you feel if you couldn’t share your cooking? Or-or imagine how Ross would feel if he couldn’t teach us about dragons.",
        "Potato, potaato.",
        "(calling from her room) Are you under the sheet?",
        "(in a soothing voice) Great, let’s begin. (She starts the massage.) How’s the pressure?",
        "Stating the obvious, but thank you. And it’s not weird is it.",
        "That’s right, you just enjoy.",
        "(getting uncomfortable) Okay.",
        "Hey.",
        "No-no, I got that.",
        "Okay. Okay but you should know though, I’ve raised my rates to $200 an hour.",
        "I mean $500.",
        "600.",
        "Oh, you make s*x noises when you get massaged!",
        "Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.",
        "Really? There’s nothing sexual about this? (Sexily) Oooh. Oo God! Ohh. Ohhhh. Ohh. (Some cute guy is watching closely.) (To him) What are you looking at?! (Pause) I mean hi.",
        "No, you can’t let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!",
        "Well not clients, lovers. But let’s just y’know, try it again. Come back and-and we’ll work through it.",
        "Yes.",
        "Great! Okay, if you’ll just excuse me. (To the guy) So, did you hear something you liked?",
        "That’s it. Just relax.",
        "Come on more!",
        "Yeah, you like that don’t you?",
        "You want it there? You take it there baby!",
        "Yeah, say my name. Say it! (She stops when she realizes what she’s doing.) And now I’m going to cover you back up, and umm we’re never doing this again.",
        "(entering) Oh hey you guys!",
        "Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?",
        "Uh-huh, (To Chandler) and you?",
        "Okay, good.",
        "Well last night, I met Monica’s.",
        "Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half.",
        "Well he’s tall.",
        "He has brown hair.",
        "He works with food!",
        "Obviously, and he’s British.",
        "Yeah? And, he’s-he’s so centered and mature and confident.",
        "Oh, I’m so sorry. Um, and maybe I’m wrong! I but—y’know I’m gonna go out with him again, I’ll find out more.",
        "Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl’s gotta eat.",
        "Oh! Hi!",
        "Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.",
        "(mouths to Chandler) Soul mate.",
        "(cough talks) Soul mate.",
        "Nothing! I swear to God I didn’t know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didn’t believe in soul mates. So…",
        "They’re just talking, and y’know what? Just because I think they’re soul mates doesn’t mean anything’s gonna happen.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Don’t worry, we’ll find you someone else.",
        "I’m so sorry.",
        "I don’t know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I don’t know how you fight that.",
        "Okay, so when you’re done with your tea I’ll look at your leaves and tell you your fortune.",
        "Oh yeah, I’ve done it for years. I actually stopped because I was so accurate. Y’know, and-and y’know, one of the great joys of life is it’s-it’s wondrous unpredictability. Y’know? And also tea tends to give me the trots.",
        "Okay. (Looks at the leaves.) Ooh, I see a ladder. (Checks the book) Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.",
        "Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm, who’s next?",
        "Okay. (Reads the leaves) Umm, oh! Okay, I see a circle.",
        "Oh! (Checking the book) Which can either mean you’re having a baby or you’re gonna make a scientific discovery!",
        "Umm… Wow, all right. (Checks the book.) Wow! Yay! Ooh, I’m gonna meet a guy! And really soon! And he’s gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night. (Points at Chandler.)",
        "(noticing a guy sitting by the green post looking at her) Oh wait a second you guys…for the last couple weeks I’ve been that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he’s the tea guy. (He gets up to leave, and smiles at Phoebe.)",
        "Oh hello.",
        "Oh Jim, Jim Nelson I’m Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. We certainly have been seeing a lot of each other lately.",
        "Well, maybe we will. (Starts to walk away.) Oh! (She turns around and the exchange information.)",
        "Isn’t it funny how we kept running into each other? It’s as if someone really wants us to be together.",
        "Oh, witty banter. Well done.",
        "Oh okay, well I’m a masseuse, and I used to work at this place…",
        "I-I-I like, I like parties.",
        "Yeah I guess, a little.",
        "(a little freaked out) So! Umm, anyway I-I lived in New York, someone wildly I guess, for umm—Well since I was fourteen.",
        "Oh stop it.",
        "Okay. Umm look, you’re coming on a little strong. But I’m going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together. So, why don’t we just start over okay? And you can just tell me about yourself.",
        "Okay.",
        "What?!",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Wow! You do?",
        "All right. (Gets up and walks out.)",
        "Oh there it is.",
        "I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store…",
        "A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and that’s what they gave me? (Looks up) When I get up there I’m going to kick some ass.",
        "Yeah, we both can. And we both will.",
        "Oh, you didn’t have to come in with me.",
        "Okay.",
        "What?",
        "Oh yeah well, I’m sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?",
        "A little. (She turns around and looks up.) (To the universe) Now you’re talking.",
        "I-I-I’d love to. Let me just tell my friend.",
        "(looking around) She must’ve left.",
        "Oh! Hey, Rach!",
        "Oh, you, too.",
        "Okay.",
        "(sighs) Honey, I wish you would get over her. I hate seeing you like this. Is there anything I can do for you? Do you want to look down my top?",
        "Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone?",
        "So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?",
        "Ugh. Come on, Mona, don’t kiss ass.",
        "All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape!",
        "It’s a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back to your apartment?",
        "Yeah. Candy’s the mother, Cookie’s the daughter. The father’s also Cookie. Why am I friends with these people?",
        "Oh, Monica, grow up!",
        "(knocking and entering) Hey. Look, I know you’ve been really depressed lately, so I brought someone over to cheer you up. Right outside this door is a real, live, furry playmate.",
        "He-hee!",
        "This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy. Now, you can only keep him until he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up!",
        "How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?",
        "Taffy, really? I’ve never had any.",
        "Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats. (Ross hands her one) Thank you! So what, you’re just never going to tell her?",
        "If I haven’t said it before: she’s a lucky, lucky lady! So, where are you going to—what the mother of crap is up with this stuff? (Referring to the taffy, which she’s been chewing this whole time.) Oh, God. Is it gum, is it food? What’s the deal? (she swallows it, finally) Oh, it’s nice! May I try a pink one?",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Hey, buddy. How’s my favorite dog, huh? How’s my favorite dog? (the dog doesn’t move) You’re subdued. (to Joey) Did you give him a beer?",
        "Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.",
        "He’s miserable! What happened to him?",
        "What stuff?",
        "Oh…Joey, you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world, and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!",
        "Okay, I’m going to take him back to Wendy’s.",
        "Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parent’s anniversary party?",
        "Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.",
        "Yeah, he’s really great though. He has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.",
        "Hey!",
        "Everybody, this is Parker, Parker this is…",
        "Hey!",
        "I’ll go with you",
        "Were you guys making fun of Parker?",
        "So, he a little enthusiastic, what’s wrong with that?",
        "Well, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people you’ve dated? Tag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends don’t do that. But, do you want my opinion? Do you want it? ‘Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the who’s who of human crap. (Walks off)",
        "No, I’m fine. I’m great. I’m with you.",
        "Hm huh, yeah.",
        "No, that’s not necessary.",
        "No, actually I don’t eat…",
        "Okay, fine! Fine! (Takes the oyster and pretends to eat it while dropping it on the floor) Mmm…hmmmmm….",
        "Why don’t you just try one?",
        "Then you better do it now.",
        "Because I’m going to kill him",
        "You guys were right. He’s just too excited about…everything. I mean I’m all for living life, but this is the Geller’s 35th anniversary. Okay? Let’s call a spade a spade this party stinks.",
        "Are you sure it wasn’t an oyster?",
        "He’s just such a great guy I’m so excited about him.",
        "You think?",
        "You’re right. You’re right, he’s just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I’m a sunny, positive person.",
        "What’s that now?",
        "Oh look it’s Parker!",
        "Oooh I love it!",
        "Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!",
        "Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?",
        "Oh thank God.",
        "Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don’t we just um, sit and relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly!",
        "Let’s try something else, let’s play a game.",
        "Shocking! Let’s play the game of who can stay quiet the longest. (Giggles)",
        "But, let’s play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses!",
        "Oh my God! Oh my God!",
        "Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn’t perfect? Everything isn’t magical? Everything isn’t a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker!",
        "You don’t have to put a good spin on everything.",
        "No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland, getting laid!",
        "Much less happy!",
        "So long! Don’t let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out! (He exits and she slams the door behind him.)",
        "Uh huh. (Closes door)",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Oh. Finally! Oh. (Sits back in relief.)",
        "I’m gonna get some coffee, anyone want anything?",
        "(interrupting him) I was just being polite!",
        "Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!",
        "Umm, I…I just think you don’t expect someone so hot to be so sweet.",
        "Umm, Phoebe Buffay.",
        "Oh okay, it’s P as in Phoebe, H as in hoebe, O as in oebe, E as in ebe, B as in bee-bee and E as in (In an Australian accent) ‘Ello there mate!",
        "Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!",
        "Ohhh.",
        "(turning from Ross.) No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!",
        "Ohh, tough call.",
        "Hey!",
        "Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.",
        "Oh, please!",
        "Well that’s no way to sell newspapers. Why don’t you try, \"Extra! Extra! Read all about it!\"",
        "Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?",
        "What?!",
        "Well did she know you two weren’t married?",
        "Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man, we-we must alert the church elders!",
        "Sounds like you’re a little jealous.",
        "Is that a real place? (Rachel’s stunned) Are they hiring?",
        "Hey Chandler, why so fancy?",
        "Wait, I think I know someone who does that.",
        "Yeah, just don’t get your hopes up.",
        "Well, the interview…",
        "Y’know! You don’t make a very good first impression.",
        "Oh you don’t know.",
        "Yes, when I first met you, you were like, \"Blah, blah, blah.\" I was like, shhh!",
        "Well it’s just like you’re trying too hard. Always making jokes, y’know, you just—You come off a little needy.",
        "Oh! It’s okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are.",
        "All right, don’t freak out! Okay? I-I will help you. How long before you have to leave?",
        "I can’t help you.",
        "All right, all right, we’ll just do our best. Okay? So let’s say I’m the interviewer and I’m meeting you for the first time. Okay. \"Hi! Come on in, I’m uh, Regina Philange.\"",
        "Bing, what an unusual name.",
        "Um-hmm, that’s good to know. But let’s stop focusing on what you don’t do, and start focusing on what you do do.",
        "I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.",
        "You gotta go!",
        "Okay, don’t worry. You’re ready.",
        "Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you’ll be great.",
        "Hey!",
        "About twenty, a couple people from work who had something else to do.",
        "Well I don’t, I don’t have a mother so often I forget that other people…",
        "No. (Pause) Neither is mine.",
        "I know. I know, what’s her number?",
        "Isn’t it at three?",
        "Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. That’s good right?",
        "What? He’s gonna be dressed as a baby! (Mrs. Green enters.) Oh hi Mrs. Green!",
        "I’m so glad you could make it.",
        "Yeah I know. Isn’t it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.",
        "No look, we’ve apologized twice! I can’t do anymore than that. I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it.",
        "For how long?",
        "She can’t hear you.",
        "Well, if you don’t want your mother to move in with you, just tell her.",
        "I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! It’s time to open the presents!",
        "How about you less important people, let’s open your presents!",
        "Okay, come on Rach it’s present time! Y’know you’re the glue that’s holding this whole party together. It’s kinda falling apart here.",
        "Okay, this is from your friend at work.",
        "Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?",
        "Not if you were here.",
        "No, not a thing.",
        "Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and she’s been nothing but terrible to you. And don’t forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasn’t even thanked you for it.",
        "Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, I’d tell her off.",
        "Uh-huh!",
        "(To Monica) Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up…",
        "You were fantastic! I’m so proud of you!",
        "You should be!",
        "You got it!",
        "I started that!",
        "Oh I know, I’ve been there. I remember toward the end…",
        "Or you can do volunteer work.",
        "Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart. What does it tell you? (Mimicking a heartbeat and tapping her chest.) Phoebe, Phoebe.",
        "(still mimicking a heartbeat, only faster) Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe—Burrrrr! (Mimics the sound of a cardiac monitor going off.)",
        "Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.",
        "When she comes out, you hold her nose, I’ll blow in her mouth, and the kid will just (makes a popping sound) right out of her.",
        "I don’t know. I-I think it’s still gonna be a while.",
        "You’re on!",
        "One hundred thousand dollars!",
        "Fine! I’ll call Zurich and move some money around.",
        "No one’s here! (Monica looks at her.) Oh damnit!",
        "Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, you’re still pregnant. Oh, I’m sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Y’know what? You look great. Yeah, like fifty bucks.",
        "It’s interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?",
        "Fine! You’re on!",
        "Until then, General Grant, why don’t you set up camp (She puts the bill in her bra) right there.",
        "Good God man don’t anger it.",
        "Oh I-I don’t know about that. No, I think that if the two of you had s*x the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic.",
        "Thank you!",
        "Okay.",
        "Is Rachel having the baby?",
        "They’re at the coffeehouse.",
        "We know it’s a girl! (Exits.)",
        "(To Monica) Oh and I need to talk to you.",
        "To see if know what these guys are talking about.",
        "(taking Ross aside) Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and Rachel?",
        "Yay! It’s so exciting! Wow, you could’ve done that with us there.",
        "Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you can’t talk to Rachel.",
        "Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy.",
        "Hey!",
        "Are you all right?",
        "Oh my God! He did it?",
        "Are you kidding? I’m like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.",
        "I just talked him into it, don’t tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.",
        "Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.",
        "Especially Ross!",
        "There he goes, your fiancée.",
        "Although he does play with himself in his sleep.",
        "Oh hey! Wait up!",
        "Congratulations! I didn’t want to say anything in front of Joey ‘cause I didn’t know if he knew yet.",
        "No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!",
        "Oh, it’s a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven’t done the secret thing in a long time.",
        "Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?",
        "All right, me too. (They go into her room and see that she’s sleeping.) Should we wake her up?",
        "And so engaged. (Points to the ring that Rachel is wearing.)",
        "Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y’know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.",
        "Really?",
        "So whose ring is it?",
        "Is it an engagement ring?",
        "But you didn’t give it to her?",
        "But you were going to propose?",
        "Huh, I might be losing interest in this.",
        "Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.",
        "No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.",
        "Oh you made it!",
        "(looking at the clock) Oh wow, three hours and still no baby. Ugh, the miracle of birth sure is a snooze fest.",
        "Sure! What?",
        "Oh, this is fun.",
        "Yeah. (Pause) Why aren’t you with Rachel?",
        "But y’know what? It just seems that you two belong together.",
        "Right. And with who again? (Ross exits.)",
        "I know!",
        "Oh, it ate your money?",
        "All right, I’ll see you downstairs then.",
        "All right.",
        "Hi.",
        "Oh down please. (The guy tries to reach the button, but can’t.) I-I hate to be a ball buster can I just do it? (She pushes the button.)",
        "Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.",
        "Well, it’s a long story. It’s kind of embarrassing. Let’s just say there was a typographical error with a s*x manual. (The guy laughs.) How about you?",
        "Oh.",
        "Uh-huh, yeah.",
        "Oh yeah! I-I would like that.",
        "Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!",
        "(to the nurse) Excuse me? Could you help me with something? The patient I’m looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. And umm, he’s like early to mid-thirties, very attractive.",
        "Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?",
        "Hands.",
        "Thank you. (Starts to exit.)",
        "(coming back for Joey) No! (Grabs Joey and drags him away.)",
        "Ooh, this is it! (Looks in the window.) Oh, that’s him! That’s him!",
        "Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.",
        "No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what’s he like. People tell doctors everything.",
        "But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.",
        "What else? What else?",
        "Oh. Ah-uh.",
        "Oh.",
        "Enter Pheebs.",
        "Okay I’ve got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?",
        "Somebody went to college. Wow. (Cliff gets uncomfortable) What is it? I’m sorry. (She moves her arm, which was resting on the same pillow his leg is.)",
        "Oh, I’ll get it. (She gets up and grabs a spoon.)",
        "Relax, it’s not like we’re forking.",
        "Y’know what? This one is. (Eats another spoonful of pudding as Cliff sees something on TV.)",
        "Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet.",
        "Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?",
        "Okay. Okay. I—Okay umm…this…I-I sent my friend Joey in here to find out stuff about you. Umm y’know, if it helps you came off great. A lot better than I’m coming off right now.",
        "You’re right, that was wrong. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. It’s just that I liked you so much. Can we just, can we just start over?",
        "Uh Joey, we’re trying to dial down the crazy.",
        "Umm, look we don’t, we don’t really know each other so it would be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between us. And I don’t know about you but that doesn’t happen to me a lot.",
        "Can we come in?",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh, she’s so beautiful.",
        "Okay, my turn. My turn. (Joey hands her to Phoebe.) Oh! You’re so cute! Oh, I could squeeze your little head! (Pause) I won’t.",
        "Ohhh. (Hands her back to Rachel.)",
        "Oh, wait a minute it’s not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!",
        "Yay!",
        "Is she in there?",
        "Oh!",
        "I just can’t decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?",
        "I’m sorry, for the last time, why aren’t you two together again? (Silence from Ross.) No, I know. I know, because you’re not in that place. Which would be fine, except you totally are.",
        "Yeah that’s true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.",

        "I can say I told you so but she’s kinda doing that for me.",
        "It really does… how long do you think we have to stay?",
        "Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her, oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!",
        "Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from having s*x with Ross!",
        "Alright you guys, we can’t turn on each other, Okay? That’s just what she wants.",
        "Oh I’m kinda part of this.",
        "I knew I should have married Chandler.",
        "Well alright, looks like you guys have got it under control so I’m just gonna go. (She gets up and Rachel looks at her, upset, and Monica just stares.) No! Really? Misery really does love company. All right! (She sits back down.)",
        "Alright, I’ll try, fine! Yes, Okay!",

        "I'm not going along with some lie you made Ross, No I'm just gonna be honest with him.",
        "yeah I've nothing to be ashamed of ok so I haven't been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. Ok I haven't had a real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave. which he will and that's ok. so I'll just be alone forever you know alright I'll be. it'll be fine. it'll be fine.

        "well there is no Vicrum, Ross made him up because I never really have been in a long-term relationship, I've never lived with a guy, and I've never even celebrated an anniversary so. (Pause) if that's too weird for you and you wanna leave I totally understand. In fact I'll close my eye's make it less awkward (She sits with her eyes closed and Mike kisses her, Phoebe opens her eyes and like a little child says.) You kissed me.",
        "so you don't think I'm a total freak",
        "I guess so, can I. can I think it's cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again (they get closer to kiss and Phoebe pulls back) and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers.",
        "you know maybe this is a wake up call, about your whole dating attitude. Your in your thirty's and you've never had a serious relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship, here you go from woman to woman, meaningless experience to meaningless experience never even worrying that it doesn't tern into anything serious.",

Because of this stupid thing (Points to her wedding ring.)\nChandler: There is nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh?\nJoey: Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot, but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week.\nChandler: I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it.\nJoey: We were gonna go see the Jets!\nRoss: You can't go, I mean you're the glue that holds this group together!\nChandler: Really?\nRoss: Not you.\nJoey: I can't believe you guys are moving.\nPhoebe: I call their apartment!!!\nEveryone: No!!! Ah!! Ahh!!!",

One cup of coffee won't affect your milk.\nRachel: Yeah. Just to be sure I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.\nJoey: (Laughs)\nRachel: Every time? (She takes up her cell phone and starts dialing.)\nJoey: Uhuh.\nRoss: Rach, you don't have to call whenever you have a little question, okay? Trust me, I know this.\nRachel: All right, I trust you. (Continues to dial)\nRoss: Rachel, I can see you dialing! I don't understand why...\nRachel: I'm on the phone! (On the phone) Dr. Wiener? (Ross and Rachel walk away)\nJoey: (Laughs)\nPhoebe: It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby. It's just so grown up.\nJoey: I know, yeah. I feel like we're all growing up. Person named Wiener, God that kills me. (Laughs)\nPhoebe: Look at you all grown up.\nJoey: Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship. You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot.\nPhoebe: You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you set me up with someone, and we double date!\nJoey: I can do that, yeah. How is Friday?\nPhoebe: Done. Oh good, really?\nJoey: Yeah!\nPhoebe: Let's see! (Opens her address book.) Oh, you know who's great? Sandy Poophack.\nJoey: (Laughs) Poophack... (Laughs)\nPhoebe: Yeah... All right, well that rules out Lana Titweiller\nJoey: (Laughs)",

(She is all dressed up)\nJoey: (Realizes that he has forgotten all about the double date) Oh my God!\nPhoebe: Ooh, great! Just the reaction I was hoping for.\nJoey: Yeah, so you found someone for me. You didn't forget?\nPhoebe: Of course not! And you're gonna love Mary Ellen. She's really smart and cute and funny, and I can't tell you how I know this, but she' not opposed to threesomes. So tell me some about my guy.\nJoey: No.\nPhoebe: Come on, give me something. What's his name?\nJoey: Mike.\nPhoebe: Mike? Okay! What's his last name?\nJoey: Damnit! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?\nPhoebe: All right, we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant in a couple hours.\nJoey and Phoebe: (Ad-lib good-byes) (Phoebe leaves)\nJoey: Why did I have to say Mike? I don't know a Mike! Why couldn't I have said... (Looks through his address book) There's no guy in there!",
        "I gotta tell you, I can't believe I'm doing this with you. Although I did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so I guess I should be open and taking some risks.\nJoey: Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay? All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.\nMike: I am Mike.\nJoey: Atta boy!\n(Phoebe and Mary Ellen enter.)\nJoey: Okay, look...\nEveryone: (Ad-lib hellos)\nPhoebe: Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do you and Joey know each other anyway?\nMike: How do I and Joey know each other? Wow, if I had a nickel for every time somebody has asked me that.\nJoey: (Laughs) From school.\nMike: Yeah, we met in college. (Off Joey's look) I mean, high school.\nPhoebe: Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up to these days?\nMike: Well, I'm a lawyer.\nJoey: Mike, 'attorney at law'!\nMike: Actually, I just gave up my practice.\nJoey: What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.\nMike: I always wanted to play piano professionally, and I figured if I don't do this now, I never will.\nPhoebe: Wow, that's great! I liked that better than the law thing, so...\nJoey: Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to Mike.\nMary Ellen: I thought you thought he was still a lawyer.\nJoey: No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail.",
        "You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.\nJoey: Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out. Mike hit my mom with a car.\nMike: No, I didn't.\nJoey: That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're friends again everything's great!\nMary Ellen Wait, is your mom okay?\nJoey: Please, we're trying to have a conversation.

That's why you look so familiar!\nPhoebe: What?!\nMike: What?!\nJoey: What?!\nPhoebe: Do you not know each other?\nJoey: (Laughs) Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that we used to play in high school. Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other. We played all kinds of games. (To Mike) Hey, remember the one where I punch you in the face for not being cool?!\nPhoebe: Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters does Joey have?\nMike: (Joey holds up six fingers) Six!\nJoey: What are you doing? I said seven! (Holds up six fingers.) (Realizes his mistake) Argh!!!\nPhoebe: Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?\nJoey: Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.\nMike: I'm sorry too. And just to be clear, I didn't hit his mother with a car.\nPhoebe: (To Joey) You are unbelievable! I spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and cute and loose.\nMary Ellen: Hey!\nPhoebe: Who are you kidding? (To Joey) You just find some guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!\nJoey: Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like this guy I can find you a better one. (Looks around) Mike!! Mike!!\nPhoebe: I'm out of here (She leaves)\nMike: It was nice meeting you!\nJoey: (To Mary Ellen) You're leaving too?\nMary Ellen: I'll stay if you can tell me my name.\nJoey: Good night!",
        "Excuse me, hi. I was hoping I would run into you. Can we talk?\nPhoebe: Sure.\nMike: I'm sorry, really, I'm so embarrassed. Really, I'm a pretty nice guy. Just ask my parole officer...Apparently I'm not a funny guy.\nPhoebe: Why did you go along with that?\nMike: Because I was told I'd get a free dinner, which I didn't. And that I'd meet a pretty girl. Which I did.\nPhoebe: That's true. (Pause) Well, is anything you told me about yourself true?\nMike: My name in Mike, and I do play piano.\nPhoebe: Prove it.\nMike: There isn't a piano here.\nPhoebe: That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.\nMike: (Plays 'air piano')\nPhoebe: You are really good! I play a little guitar myself.\nMike: Really?\nPhoebe: Uhuh.\nMike: That's great. What kind of music do you play?\nPhoebe: Well, like acoustic folksy stuff. You know? But right now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers.\nMike: Do you think that maybe, sometime, I could...\nPhoebe: It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.\nMike: Okay. Do you think maybe sometime I could take you out?\nJoey: (Walks In)\nPhoebe: (To Mike) Oh, you just caught me off guard! Yeah, that would be nice.\nJoey: Look at this.

        "Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go. (Both Phoebe and Mike look really proud.)",
        "It really is.",
        "(gasps) Oh my God! David!",
        "(excited) No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW, hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?",
        "Who cares, it got you here.",
        "Wow. Where is your luggage? (David thinks for a while)",
        "A-Allright, well... I'll call the cab company.",
        "Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually, no, I look pretty good.",
        "No...",
        "I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?",
        "He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no...",
        "Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking, I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's here. He's just, he's so irresistible.",
        "Really? Chandler?",
        "Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night.",
        "I know! (points at herself) Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!",
        "(sarcastically) Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am.",
        "I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong...",
        "Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey.",
        "Hey!",
        "Okay. (and she walks away)",
        "No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...",
        "Oof...",
        "Oh, wait, wait!",
        "No, no, it's not that. (they go sit on the couch) Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike.",
        "Yeah, I should have told you.",
        "I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",
        "I am happy.",
        "Well... but David, just... I just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.",
        "Of course, yeah.(they hug and Phoebe sighs... a little after that also David sighs and makes his way to the door) You know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate...",
        "I mean... (David kisses Phoebe on the cheek, makes his way to the door and turns around again)",
        "Yeah?",
        "Well, if that's what they do in Minsk... (They kiss 2 on each cheek... and then they pause... David turns to the door) In New York... it's... (and then David grabs her by her neck and kisses her full on the lips... They kiss passionately and cannot seem to stop.)",
        "Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this. It's bad.",
        "No, no. No.",
        "Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with Mike and I really care about him...",
        "(points to David) And you thanks for the face massage. Thank you.",
        "No, no, no, no, no... It's not... it's not... i'ts not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend.",
        "No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years ago, and he lives in Minsk. He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days.",
        "No, no...",
        "Oh, well, yeah...",
        "Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt! (they stop and Phoebe gets David's jacket and gives it to him) Here David, you should just go.",
        "Okay, well... guys?",
        "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your key back, I totally understand.",
        "Right! Never! Never! I swear! (They kiss... The door opens and David comes in again.)",
        "Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving!",
        "Hey, what's going on Joe?",
        "Oh okay. How about the whole \"man walking on the moon\" thing. You know? You. you could. You could see the strings people!",
        "Ooh, honey. You stink at lying.",
        "Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday at the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin was gone-who took it?",
        "Don't worry, don't worry. We'll come up with a good lie. I'll help you practice it.",
        "Sure, what.. what was the work thing?",
        "\"Pick up grandma at the airport\"?",
        "Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying.",
        "Thats a great movie. <she claps>",
        "Emma, Ross wants you.",
        "PHOE-BE.",
        "There's your movie! <claps>",
        "It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency.",
        "Ooh, what happened?",
        "No! Nothing with a raccoon.",
        "Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.",
        "Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?",
        "It's all right. You can mourn.",
        "Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?",
        "Broke them all, huh?",
        "You gonna tell her?",
        "No problem! Next week: stealing... (Chandler walks away to store the box of broken china.)",
        "Hi!",
        "Ooh. You’re first night out, indeed!",
        "Oh, god. Do you remember the girls’ nights that we used to have? Sitting around, talking about you and Ross?",
        "I know.",
        "So what’s going on with you and Ross?",
        "Woah! Oh my god! I love things! What happened?",
        "Eye contact?",
        "I hope you were using protection.",
        "Should we send them something back? Yes, let’s do! Let’s send them mashed potatoes!!",
        "So, what if they do?",
        "Yeah, but, um, nothing has to happen. Just having fun. You know, not everything has to go as far as ‘eye contact’.",
        "Yeah, I’m sorry. We weren’t really looking for anything to happen with you guys. I-I have a boyfriend.",
        "Oh my god! You’re giving your real number!",
        "Bye",
        "Wow. So that's great. You, Bill, Ross and Emma are going to be so happy together. What were you thinking?",
        "But what about Ross? What about your moment? Don’t you want to talk to Ross about it?",
        "Yeah, I see what you mean. By the way, nice Ross imitation. But your Rachel was not whiney enough.",
        "Better!",
        "So, really? Are you moving on from Ross?",
        "You kinda just did. That guy’s gonna call you tonight. Ross is going to pick up the phone. That’s a pretty clear message.",
        "[As Rachel] “Ah, I have to get my number back!”, “Oh my god! He’s gone!” Dead on!",
        "Hey Mike, it’s me. Listen: Is Ross near you?",
        "Well, you have to go back in.",
        "I’m so sorry, honey, but, okay. Rachel gave this guy her number, and, erm, she does not want Ross to answer the phone, so you have to intercept all of his calls.",
        "[To Rachel] He says that he can’t do that",
        "Alright, give it here. [Phoebe takes the phone] Hello? I'm sorry about her, but, she wasn’t wrong about the dirty stuff.",
        "Oh, oh, Mike! Bye. [Hangs up]",
        "Hey!",
        "Well, goodbye!",
        "I’ll be right back. I just have to go to the bathroom.",
        "...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle;\nand away they all flew like the down of a thistle;\nbut I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,\n\"Merry Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!\"",
        "(smiling) Uh-huh.",
        "Oh, I like my job.",
        "So here is a, a very special holiday song that I wrote for some\nvery important people to me.",
        "Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern\nyou.",
        "No-no, we do it every year!",
        "No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us, that\nwily... minx.",
        "Oh no, we have to!",
        "Well then, you should look with us.",
        "Oh, that's it? (Mimics Chandler) A great idea! Oh yeah.",
        "Ooh ooh, we have a live one!",
        "Ooh, who's it for?",
        "Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I\nwas getting gas?",
        "You guuuyys.",
        "(simultaneous to the others) Ble-blah-blar Blargh!",
        "(simultaneous to the others) Blah blargah, blar-blab.",
        "(at the window) Hey look, you guys, it's snowing!",
        "Aren't we done with that?",
        "Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could\nhave ever imagined.",
        "Now give me my real gift.",
        "(to Chandler) Thank you.",
        "Joey, can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?",
        "I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash.",
        "Oh no, no, no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore.",
        "You could do that?",
        "Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV!",
        "Oh, really?",
        "Wow! Hey, why are you all dressed up?",
        "Joey, look at me! I'm a nurse!",
        "Yeah! But I'm a little shaky and nervous.",
        "Okay, now. What?",
        "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.",
        "Okay, that helps.",
        "Hey. So, what did he say?",
        "I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm not an actor.",
        "Joey.",
        "Who dies?",
        "Yes, doctor.",
        "Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch, your tray is coming!",
        "(Does the scene) Yes, I did it!!! I nailed it!!! Yay! What's next?",
        "Okay, from the top, people!",
        "Joey, listen. I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?",
        "Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I'm the waitress? That's gonna confuse my fans.",
        "Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children.",
        "Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him?",
        "About what?",
        "And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.",
        "Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back.",
        "I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process.",
        "Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. You're threatened.",
        "Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus from you. Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni 'cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here!",
        "Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?",
        "No. It starts with a \"v\" and ends with an \"x\". Helpfully with a \"to\" in the middle.",
        "What?",
        "(relived) Oh, whew, no, that's Bob.",
        "Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies.",
        "What are those?",
        "OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob.",
        "So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers. (Mike throws out everything in his mouth)",
        "Hey Mikey",
        "What are you doing?",
        "To kill Bob??",
        "No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.",
        "I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob? (starts looking) Bob! Robert! (looks at cabinet under sink) Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom!",
        "I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.",
        "Oh my god, we killed Bob!",
        "Suzie? (Runs over there to check)",
        "Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!",
        "I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother.",
        "No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed them.",
        "Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone can afford help. (she and Mike leave)",
        "Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.",
        "Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now.",
        "Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.",
        "No. (opens the box) wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then each of those have 7 rats? That's like ... (starts counting with her fingers) That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?",
        "Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away. But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's favorites.",
        "You must think I'm crazy.",
        "Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go. I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to my brother's triplets and I had to give them up. (Mike is shocked) I haven't told you about that yet, have I?",
        "(walks in) Hey",
        "Listen, I think I've left something here.",
        "(likes the jacket) No, but I like it. I think I left one of my rat babies.",
        "(realizes) Ooh, maybe that's him!",
        "Well it depends.",
        "On how far along he's in the s*x change process!",
        "Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...",
        "Wow! Talking about high maintenance",
        "I'm a woman!",
        "Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?",
        "But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped out",
        "Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?",
        "OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing.",
        "While drinking...",
        "Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out there",
        "Oh my god.",
        "It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper.",
        "Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!",
        "\"No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world...!\" Thank you!",
        "Hi hi...Oh you have got to sing.",
        "But you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice.",
        "All the time when you're cooking.",
        "Yeah you're always singing \"Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in my tummy\"",
        "OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?",
        "Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyone",
        "Can you totally see through her shirt ?",
        "Every little bit of you!",
        "Mon', not that you didn’t sound good, but...",
        "Oh you’ll probably take care of that on your hands.",
        "Yes, she gives the people what they want.",
        "Oh? Isn’t that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have let her go up again.",
        "Hey.",
        "What you got?",
        "Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart from the great food.",
        "Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.",
        "I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.",
        "I just wish they'd realise they should be together.",
        "I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.",
        "You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.",
        "So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?",
        "Yeah. (BEAT) Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together.",
        "Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my \"plan-laugh.\" (A maniacal laugh follows.)",
        "Ooh, Joey. ",
        "Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight. ",
        "Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "A teacher?",
        "Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman! ",
        "Yeah.",
        "How do you even know a woman like that?",
        "Joey.",
        "So now what do we do?",
        "What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!",
        "Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together.",
        "It's not Santa's plan. No, it's... (Laughs the real \"plan-laugh.\")",
        "No, I think we killed it.",
        "Hello?",
        "Hey, Rach!",
        "You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends. ",
        "Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned.",
        "Did he go out for a cigarette? ",
        "My dear, sweet Rach.",
        "By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny Mexico. (BEAT) Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan.",
        "Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?",
        "How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?",
        "Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes.",
        "Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working.",
        "Don't, don't do the plan-laugh.",
        "Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again.",
        "Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out. They're coming this way. Run!",
        "Mexico!",
        "What's your news?",
        "(inquisitive) Gosh, what's the pay like? (Everybody stares at her indignantly) Oh, come on people… (defending) come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most! (She looks at Joey) Hey Joey! (Joey winks at her)",
        "(enthusiastic) That's great.",
        "Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight?",
        "Oh, I hear divorce bells. ",
        "No.",
        "Lowell, is that you?",
        "(simultaneously) Oh my god! ",
        "(excited) I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the streets. Lowell, Ross.",
        "Ah, it's been so long, so long. (They hug again) I can't believe you're still doing this!",
        "Good for you! ",
        "Ouh… (she nods)",
        "Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up…",
        "I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us. ",
        "Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know… sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I…",
        "Well, ok, I wasn't rich like you guys, ok, I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony… I had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer…",
        "She was a drug dealer!",
        "(laughing) Okay…",
        "Why?",
        "(worried) You were?",
        "(shocked) Oh my god…",
        "No… actually, you might wanna stay away from Jane street… that's where stabby Joe works. ",
        "Okay, I think we have a problem here. ",
        "Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics. ",
        "Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat. ",
        "Well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said-",
        "I know… I mugged Ross! ",
        "(spotting Ross) Hey, you!",
        "Hey, how was class?",
        "Nothing, I really wanna know.",
        "(interrupting) Alright, nothing is worth this. Uhm, I have a confession to make… uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid…",
        "You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl.",
        "Yes, it was. ",
        "(interrupting, pinching his year) \"Gimme your money, punk!\"",
        "(apologetic) Yeah, and I'm so, so sorry, Ross, I'm sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it's kinda neat. (She smiles at him, but he doesn't understand) I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have… have a great one! ",
        "I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say…",
        "Really? Even more humiliating than…",
        "Hey, Ross! (He lowers his newspaper and scowls at her) I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second? ",
        "I just really wanted to apologize again and… and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting. ",
        "Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell… or smoke. (Ross looks at her in astonishment) Anyway, I was looking through it and I found \"Science Boy\" (She holds up some sheets of paper and hands them to Ross)",
        "I can't say, I just thought it was really good… and… maybe would be worth something some day. ",
        "Yeah… but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here. ",
        "You're welcome. And thank you for \"Science Boy\". I learned a lot from him ",
        "Hey!",
        "Sure!",
        "Well, I can't give you a massage, because my licence has been revoked again!",
        "Well, it was an accident...You know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips!",
        "Oh no!You guys aren't supposed to get divorced for 7 years!",
        "Oh, good!Ok, good for you!Try to recapture the magic!",
        "And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing!",
        "(playing guitar and singing) And there's a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I've never seeeeen. But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. Humaaan spleeeeen. Olè!",
        "Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so I am here to entertain!",
        "Yeah! It really has been great too, you know, some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! Yeah, \"You suck\" and \"shut up and go home\".",
        "Yeah.",
        "But what?",
        "(pause) Ok, say no more.",
        "(with a fancy dress, still playing and singing): It wasn't just that she was fat, the woman smelled like garbage! Everyone! It wasn't just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbaaaaaage! (to Monica, showing her dress) Classy, uh?",
        "Hey!",
        "Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant (she dons a top hat) uh, huh wait! (she raises a pair of spectacles to her eyes) Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.",
        "Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.",
        "Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back (she puts the hat in a bag and she crushes it angrily on the floor with her foot).",
        "My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?",
        "Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?",
        "Yeah well, \"excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but (peering through her spectacles) I can't see it, I can't see it\"!",
        "Well...it's not about quality.",
        "Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.",
        "Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?",
        "What are people having, the garlic Martini?",
        "(singing) Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you..",
        "You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.",
        "Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!",
        "(while Monica drags her in the restaurant) Get your garlic-peelers off me!",
        "Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? (a few people raise their hands) Ha!",
        "Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?",
        "Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? (all raise their hands).",
        "Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! (raises her hand)",
        "I'm sorry too... (they hug)",
        "Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p...",
        "(smiling, raising her hand) Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?",
        "Why??",
        "Oh...you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you.",
        "I want you to stay.",
        "Why don't you turn them inside ou...",
        "I'll miss you.",
        "Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top.",
        "Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say \"Hell yeah!\"",
        "Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together! (They embrace and Mike kisses Phoebe) Oh god, we're really going to move in together!",
        "I've always wanted to live with a guy. \"Pick up your socks!\" \"Put down the toilet seat!\" \"No! We're not having s*x anymore!\" It's gonna be fun!",
        "Hey you guys! Ok, we've got great news.",
        "I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before.",
        "Okay, well you put down the toilet seat.",
        "Uh huh...we're playing you two.",
        "Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah. Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do.",
        "I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a soccer mom!",
        "Yeah! You bet roomy!",
        "Oh please, these guys, we haven't even moved in yet and they have us picking out china patterns. (Mike seems to gag a little...and laughs nervously. They begin to leave. Phoebe bolts back)",
        "China patterns!!!!!",
        "Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's a play on the word roomy.",
        "Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where it goes.",
        "What do you mean?",
        "Oh. Wow.",
        "Was it really that bad?",
        "Ok, well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different with someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in the ocean.",
        "But it's just...",
        "Oh!",
        "No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!",
        "Yeah I get that.",
        "Hi",
        "Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage.",
        "No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.",
        "Mike doesn't ever wanna get married.",
        "Never.",
        "I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks!",
        "That's not how you really feel is it?",
        "Seriously? You divorce-o?",
        "It's ok that's how you feel.",
        "I do love Mike.",
        "Yeah I guess you're right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks.",
        "It's not cooler.",
        "Better.",
        "Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you.",
        "What do you mean?",
        "They are awfully boxy...",
        "Uh huh.",
        "Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle room? None at all?",
        "Right. Except that I do want to get married.",
        "Someday.",
        "I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the regular stuff.",
        "Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and I wanted to live with you.",
        "But I don't think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn't know what was gonna happen, but I can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen.",
        "Are you gonna change yours?",
        "Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.",
        "I don't want it to end either.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hey will you get me tickets too?",
        "You don't wanna win the lottery?",
        "(excited)Hey you guys! Ok, you're not going to believe this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!",
        "Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. It's really not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!",
        "I hope I win!",
        "One, two, three!",
        "Get a room!",
        "Oooh, I like that, \"daddy\" (in a sexy tone)",
        "(still in sexy tone) Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna spank me?",
        "Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?",
        "Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.",
        "Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets together (takes the bowl from Ross and puts it on the table)",
        "(she takes the bowl from Rachel's hands and she starts running around the room and yelling) OOOOOHHHHH!",
        "(keeping on running and yelling) OOOOOHHHHH! (she stops) Fine, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this! (she goes out to the balcony)",
        "If we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at all! So, say goodbye to your tickets! (She holds out the bowl, and makes as to drop the tickets on the street).",
        "Don't come any closer!",
        "No, what's more important, your friends or money?",
        "Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?",
        "Ok, good! (pause) You guys were so scared! There was no way I was gonna dump this...(a pigeon swoops down, scaring Phoebe who drops the bowl on the street) Oh God, no! (pause) I think I broke your bowl.",
        "What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.",
        "So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I was gonna win, remember?",
        "As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die. (pause ) So, excuse me for being a little skittish.",
        "Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.",
        "Guys, the drawing is about to start!",
        "I'm still looking through mine...",
        "You guys, what was the Powerball number again?",
        "We won.",
        "We won!",
        "Don't tear it.",
        "I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number, we've won 3 dollars!",
        "(still very excited) I don't care, I've never won anything before, I can't believe this!",
        "It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents.",
        "I beg to differ (shows him her cup of coffee and her plate of cookies).",
        "(hides her mouth behind the cup and speaks in the \"pigeon voice\" from before) Coo, again. Don't blame the pretty lady. It was not her fault. It was me, the pigeon, coo! (pause) Seriously, stop staring at her.",
        "Hi.",
        "Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!",
        "Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!! (pause) Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this...",
        "Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you.",
        "Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.",
        "(after a pause) Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.",
        "That was a test and you just failed.",
        "God, I wish Mike were here.",
        "I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.",
        "Here.",
        "Okay (she takes a huge, clearly obsolete cellphone she keeps in a closet and gives it to Monica)",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.",
        "You can't have it.",
        "No (tucks it in her pants)",
        "(disbelievingly) Oh yeah.",
        "Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!",
        "You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.",
        "Those are my shoes.",
        "Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.",
        "I ordered Chinese food.",
        "What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?",
        "I'm sorry, I broke down... I wanted to see him.",
        "There is a speakerphone on the base unit...",
        "Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?",
        "Sit down.",
        "Thanks, you look good too.",
        "So how's the piano playing going?",
        "I've missed you too.",
        "I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?",
        "What?",
        "Oh, I missed you so much! (she kisses Mike)",
        "Who is this?",
        "Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid!",
        "(entering) Hey!",
        "Hey you guys! Look what I just got. (she shows them a pair of slippers)",
        "I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania Twain.",
        "Oh... then I overpaid. (she goes to the bathroom)",
        "(coming back from the bathroom) What's up? (she sees the gift certificate in Rachel's hands) Hey, Rachel!!",
        "No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these \"big massage places\"! They're putting people like me out of business!",
        "Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about... it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.",
        "Well, do you care about friendship?",
        "I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend.",
        "Promise?",
        "Thank you. (she tears up the gift certificate)",
        "Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around? (She sees Rachel) Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone who can fill in for me?",
        "But that woman can't know I work here. She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this massage chains are.",
        "'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!",
        "(watching around and whispering) Ok, are they listening?",
        "(In a strange heavy accent) Hello \"ja\", it's time for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole.",
        "Okay, then I'm Swedish...",
        "It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea...",
        "Ja!",
        "(pushes her head back down) Time for your scalp massage!",
        "Is something wrong?",
        "(Thinks for a few moments) Uhm... Stockholm.",
        "(Singing) \"Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! \" And that is the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking! (looks annoyed)",
        "Oh, Ja! Ja!",
        "Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?",
        "Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass!",
        "You know it's me?",
        "How can you come here?",
        "I don't have to tell you everything!",
        "Tips not included.",
        "Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know... you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! paying taxes!",
        "You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time I took my life back!",
        "Ok.",
        "Okay (walks out and closes the door behind her, looks up and whispers) If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any of that. I love you.",
        "(imitating the receptionist's tone) Good morning receptionist.",
        "Rachel Green? (angrily) Son of a bitch, she came back?",
        "(through the door, with a Scottish accent) Are you ready for your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole, lassy.",
        "What is it?",
        "I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too! (pause) Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?",
        "Ah, ah.",
        "Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!",
        "Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?",
        "And that horrible museum tour!",
        "We know about your party Joey.",
        "Hey!",
        "Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway? (Looks around)",
        "Hey Ross!",
        "Oh, What's the matter?",
        "Worse?",
        "(still laughing) No. (points to Rachel who stuck two straws in her mouth to look like a mammoth's tusks)",
        "Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?",
        "Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe Phd.",
        "You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny...",
        "Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!",
        "Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!",
        "Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.",
        "(entering and talking on mobile phone) Ok, great! All right, bye! (she hangs up) Pain in the ass!! (she looks at the others, then back at the phone) That's off, right?",
        "Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. And she was like \"Oh, don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you!\". So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!",
        "Exactly!",
        "(after a short pause) I didn't even think about that! (pause) Aaargh, sexual politics!!",
        "Ok, that'll be great!",
        "Oh, I'll take some of that.",
        "No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy. (to the shop assistant) Yeah.",
        "Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. (to the shop assistant). Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!",
        "(picks up a dress) Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?",
        "Ok!",
        "So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?",
        "Why?",
        "Who else?",
        "You like Joey?",
        "(whispering) Oh my God!",
        "Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?",
        "Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Sure!",
        "Oh.",
        "Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?",
        "Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me.",
        "(sticks her head out) I didn't say anything yet!",
        "(goes back in) I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.",
        "(comes out too) Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.",
        "Ooh! We have a problem.",
        "Good plan.",
        "Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at \"who's more over who\"! (at which she walks away)",
        "Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party.",
        "Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture.",
        "You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room.",
        "David?",
        "Oh my God! (they hug)",
        "Yeah. What-what are you doing here?",
        "What happened?",
        "Yeah?",
        "Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?",
        "Good!",
        "(disappointed) Oh, good for you.",
        "Mike and I broke up.",
        "Really?",
        "I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That's so not like us!",
        "Well... (pause) no.",
        "I'd love to.",
        "Ok. (they walk away together)",
        "Oh, got it, stay upwind of me.",
        "Hey!",
        "Well, okay, Mike's taking a shower, which by the way there's no law against. And then we're gonna grab some food, so if you want...",
        "Is that Ross?",
        "Sounds like he's with someone.",
        "Oh that tart... floozy... giant...",
        "Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business.",
        "Oh, I'm not gonna do this, okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.",
        "(whispering) Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!!!",
        "Get over here!",
        "We've got shoes being kicked off over here.",
        "You gotta hear this, it's great... It's like free p0rn! (Chandler eagerly rushes over)",
        "That's the door. He's gone...",
        "Oh, we're just... we're sad to go so we're just saying goodbye to the hotel. (hugs the wall) I love you... Paradise Hotel, Golf resort and Spa... (she walks away from the wall)",
        "Shhh... This is the listening side of the wall.",
        "YE-AH!",
        "Now, what is this?",
        "Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?",
        "Hey, have you guys seen Monica?",
        "Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright...",
        "Who's day just got better? CHANDLER!",
        "Uhm... You know, once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin...",
        "Aaah... you're not good at this...",
        "No, I think I can come over. It's Saturday, right?",
        "What?",
        "Why not?",
        "You have a... You have a date? With who?",
        "(lets go of his hand) You have... have a girlfriend?",
        "For how long?",
        "Three months? Okay... This is probably none of my business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?",
        "Oh, okay... good. You do that. And then when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you.",
        "You know what, we're gonna have s*x. Let's just leave it there.",
        "Hi, Mike's place.",
        "Ooh, that was fast.",
        "Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know, women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F.Y.I.",
        "Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?",
        "Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout. (laughs and hangs up the phone)",
        "(stunned) I... I'm Phoebe.",
        "Enchanté (she holds out her hand, and they shake hands)",
        "Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is... I'm gonna take off.",
        "Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?",
        "Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.",
        "Well, I don't...",
        "Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.",
        "Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have some pride, for the love of God.",
        "Okay, not a fan of the tough love.",
        "But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...",
        "Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.",
        "You're welcome!",
        "I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.",
        "No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die.",
        "Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.",
        "Mike?? Who's Mike?",
        "That's right! Oh, yeah... Well, I've totally forgotten about im! AH! That's-That's... a blast from the past!",
        "Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!",
        "I'm sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away, right?",
        "Yeah.",
        "You just did it again. Chandler, your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone!",
        "(shouts after David) Oh! David, get one for us too! Oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! And with mirrors on the ceiling!",
        "Not Joey.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Are you leaving \"The Supremes\"? (Monica and Phoebe go to one side)",
        "Wow? Really? That's fantastic!",
        "Oh, ok, you want me to marry Mike? Alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. I can just see it: \"Mike, do you take Phoebe...\" (gestures with her hand as if someone is covering her mouth and tries to shout \"No! No!\") You know, it's every girl's dream!",
        "Sure! Look, ok, bottom line: I love Mike... David! David. I love David. Don't look at me that way, Roseanne Rosannadanna!",
        "Sure, ok, yeah.",
        "Oh my God, Mike!",
        "No, Mike's here.",
        "What are you, what are you doing here?",
        "(smiles at him happily for a few seconds before answering) No!",
        "I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.",
        "David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.",
        "Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.",
        "Yes! (they hug)",
        "Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. (Grabs a drink and notices that the two men are upset) Not you guys. You got it going on!",
        "... and...?",
        "All right, all right... I'll play if we don't keep score!",
        "Nobody wins!",
        "Yeah, I'm out.",
        "Mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing!",
        "No idea! I though he was soft like you!",
        "(picks up a coin from her bra) Monica, you call it.",
        "Tails!",
        "(smiling proudly) He was a lawyer!",
        "(looking at Mike) Oh, yeah! (turning to Chandler) Are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by Monica, right now?",
        "C'mon Mike, you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head!",
        "(pointing at Mike and shouting) I sleep with him!",
        "(to Mike) Ok Mike, better come back Mike, better come back.",
        "Mike wins?",
        "You can't do that!",
        "Ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister.",
        "It's like watching p0rn!",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, you won't believe who moved back to town.",
        "You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on the phone? (apes Amanda in a british accent) \"Oh, so sorry to catch you on your Mo-Bile!\" If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don't call me on my mo-Bile!\"",
        "Oh, I know! \"Oh...I slept with Billy Joel\". All right, who hasn't?",
        "Ugh, Let's just cut her out!",
        "Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!",
        "Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again.",
        "Oh, you’re right! I was just kidding about Rachel. Babysitting is a gas!",
        "Ok, don’t hold thy breath!",
        "Why, why, why didn’t you just say no!",
        "(leaving) Fine, fine! You would not hold up well under torture!",
        "I did!",
        "Hey!",
        "No.",
        "Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?",
        "(makes a face) Are you kidding, I love it!",
        "Hi!",
        "Musty!",
        "Well...kinda.",
        "Yeah well, in America you're just an \"ass\".",
        "(Also gets up and starts taking her purse) Oh my God. Was Mike with him?",
        "Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can I talk to you outside for a minute?",
        "Please, Monica? In the hall?",
        "It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.",
        "You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!",
        "Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.",
        "Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you.",
        "Yeah, I guess you're right.",
        "Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!",
        "Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!",
        "Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.",
        "Joey, it's a birthday party.",
        "So you’re gonna... hit on her?",
        "Oh!",
        "Or you could stick a fork in an apple!",
        "Separate performances.",
        "Sure, yeah!",
        "(to Joey) Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?",
        "That’s right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to hers. For there’s no greater gift, than the gift of music. (she starts singing) Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy birthday Emma!",
        "No, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading (she picks up a book). “s*x and the single mother. (pause) Finding your G-spot.",
        "And you know, I have a massage client soon.",
        "Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go.",
        "Oh no! He's not getting away that easy! (Phoebe and Joey run towards the bathroom and enter)",
        "No, it did not.",
        "Joey? How could you just let them leave?",
        "Wh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!",
        "Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as the person who realized that, I get to go!",
        "No, lets just draw straws.",
        "(Visibly excited) Yeah!! Let's do that!",
        "Ok! I want the dolphin!",
        "I'm too excited!",
        "Go! Go!",
        "Good job Alan!",
        "Yeah, see you later!",
        "Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?",
        "Oh good, I didn't miss the party.",
        "I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something, you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright.",
        "(pointing at cake) Hey, you made it into a bunny.",
        "(yelling at the top of her voice) Go, go, go Alan! Run you, hairy b*st*rd!\nend",
        "(she enters) Hey...",
        "Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this... (she shows her ring) HUGE engagement ring!",
        "Well, it was really sweet, and like the most romantic thing ever.",
        "Thank you! (to Rachel) Oh, and I have something for you!",
        "It's, yes, my little black book. It's got the numbers of all the guys I've dated.",
        "I would, but you're the last one.",
        "Oh, my first love!",
        "Dead. (everyone is a bit upset) Oh, it's OK, no, he was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave at Omaha Beach.",
        "(proud of herself) Oh yes, they are.",
        "(looking at Monica entering) Hey!",
        "Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing out stuff, so Mike could move in.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?",
        "A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me to get rid of Gladys.",
        "Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh, I know!! Oh, you should take her!",
        "Why, you don't like her?",
        "Really? You think?",
        "Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her.",
        "Hi! Sorry, I'm late.",
        "No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news is, Gladys is yours!",
        "Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know, with the woman coming out of the frame.",
        "Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!",
        "Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads, she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. (she flips the coin). Tails! Monica, she's yours!",
        "(smiling from ear to ear) Well, Gladys say hello to your new home! (she holds out the 'painting')",
        "(genuinely excited about it) Yeah, yeah! And you can get rid of that French poster.",
        "Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?",
        "Hey! (there's a pause)",
        "You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her anymore. (she goes out into the hallway and enters with an even more hideous painting/collage. One of those faceles mannequins heads wearing a blueish dress and orange gloves reaching out into the room. Around the head 3 small dolls are hovering.) Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis. (Rachel and Monica are gasping for air at the sight of this monstrous piece of art.)",
        "I knew it!\n[Scene: Central Perk. Some time later that day. The group has left and Charlie is there when Ross enters.]",
        "Hey!",
        "Yes, I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.",
        "YEAH!",
        "Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game.",
        "Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and... I'm gonna put on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have s*x in a public rest room.",
        "Excuse me, anniversary. Excuse me, anniversary. (looking at her ticket). Uhm, sir, could you move your nachos... they’re in my seat. It's my anniversary. (to Mike) Here we are! (Mike nods). Can’t believe it's been a whole year!",
        "ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!",
        "YOU’RE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND (crowd stops cheering) YOU'RE AMAZING IN BED (everyone hears it and stare at them.) (to everybody) IT’S OUR ANNIVERSARY!",
        "Oh how lame... oh, it’s so tacky, and impersonal.",
        "Oh, it’s the worst way to propose!",
        "Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.",
        "Well, mine was worse than that.",
        "We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing...",
        "Well, that’s what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!",
        "Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this!",
        "Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?",
        "(To Rachel and Ross) Well, do you think I should propose?",
        "Ok, ok, so how should I do it?",
        "Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two (points to Ross and Chandler) like that?",
        "No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..",
        "Uhuh, uhuh... (seems distracted)",
        "I'm not. I'm praying. (looking up) Please let the Knicks win... Thank you Thor! (Mike is standing up) Where... where are you going?",
        "Well, I think you should wait.",
        "Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the nutrients.",
        "Mike Hannigan... will you marry me? (Mike looks bewildered)",
        "That's not very enlightened!",
        "Hey, hey! (shouting) Boo us? Boo you!",
        "That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking about. Mike, obviously you have balls.",
        "(the waiter puts a piece of cake on the table) I would love it. Consider it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.",
        "It's in the cake, isn't it?",
        "What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm sorry!",
        "Oh my God!",
        "Wait! Oh wait! (she takes off a ring that was already on her left ring finger. After that Mike starts to kneel again, but then...) Oh no! (She was wearing rings on all her fingers and her thumb, and takes all of these off.)",
        "Uh-huh! (and now Mike kneels properly)",
        "Yes!",
        "I love you more!",
        "Hey guys!",
        "Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.",
        "Hey, what's all this stuff?",
        "Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!",
        "Oh, how does it work?",
        "Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.",
        "Hey!",
        "Good to see you.",
        "Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.",
        "Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.",
        "Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing..",
        "That's a, that's a long time.",
        "Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area.",
        "What?",
        "Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!",
        "What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?",
        "Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?",
        "Insane.",
        "Alice would never go for it, right?",
        "Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?",
        "Frank Jr.Jr.?",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?",
        "Alright, so that leaves Chandler.",
        "Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.",
        "I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I'll be there.",
        "Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together.",
        "Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for.",
        "Hey.",
        "Still, he had to find out sometime.",
        "Oh, right! Your adoption interview!",
        "What are you gonna name the baby?",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, that's Sarah. No, no. Don't you get any ideas, ok? No, I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends!",
        "Because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!",
        "Mandy.",
        "No.",
        "Fine, I'll give you her number.",
        "SARAH!",
        "Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than welcome to come with us, right?",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night.",
        "Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back?",
        "What are you talking about? Sarah's great!",
        "That’s it? That’s why you won’t go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal!",
        "What?",
        "I’m sorry, I can’t believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!",
        "(to Rachel) Oh",
        "Thank God you’re here. Listen to this!",
        "Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...",
        "What? You know about the plate thing?",
        "(to Joey) You wouldn’t let her have a grape?",
        "Well, I still think that it’s a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!",
        "(to Ross) This place is awesome!",
        "Wow!",
        "Yeah!",
        "What? They will be!",
        "Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got.",
        "Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?",
        "oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.",
        "Hey!",
        "It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea how expensive this stuff was!",
        "So what did you two do about it?",
        "But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?",
        "Yeah! Now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at City Hall?",
        "Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.",
        "Well, I think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one (she gives him a check)",
        "And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.",
        "Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.",
        "Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.",
        "Sure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!",
        "Oh, look! And we get these free t-shirts! (she takes a t-shirt which was on the counter)",
        "Mhm... it's moist.",
        "Hello, is this the creepy residence?",
        "Awe, this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I won’t be needing a veil, I actually won’t be wearing a dress at all!",
        "No, no, no, we’re not having a big reception, we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.",
        "We, you know, we’re different! We don’t care about having a huge party. (She picks up the veil) This is really nice for you, but, oh, please, I put this on? (she puts it on) And, ow, I look (she looks her reflex image on a toaster), why, well, radiant. (pause) All right, well, who cares, I don’t need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.",
        "City Hall.",
        "It’s ok, it’s ok. I made my decision. What I really want is a great big wedding (she covers her mouth)",
        "Well, I’ll just ask for it back!",
        "It’s for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight, because one of us gonna have to start flirting.",
        "The donation we made earlier, we k…, we w…, we want it back.",
        "Yeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn’t want, but it turns out we do.",
        "I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me.",
        "Hey, that’s not fair! A person’s wedding is important! And especially to me! Ok? I didn’t have a graduation party! And I didn’t go to Prom. And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to “kill me” or whatever. So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it.( She storms out)",
        "(Lightly) Oh! It ended okay. One of my friends shot him.",
        "Yeah, I really do. You know, I had nothing growing up. (thinks for a few\nseconds) Just like the kids I took the money from.",
        "Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now. It's tainted.",
        "And if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time, my friend hasn't shot\nanyone in a really long time.",
        "(to the Charity guy) We're back!",
        "Yeah, because you know what, it's... it's all about the children.",
        "Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here. (she gives the check and pulls it back again) No... Oh God... Oh!",
        "But... but... but we're giving you this!",
        "(looks at the amount on the check, and gasps) Well, this is very generous!",
        "Oh, is that you?",
        "Hey!",
        "Hey!",
        "Well, personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a break.",
        "Sure. It's just as well... I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch.",
        "Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself.",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.",
        "You're not making the pies yourself?",
        "Hey Rach.",
        "What's Emma doing today?",
        "Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.",
        "Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!",
        "(sarcastic) Oh... okay.",
        "Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.",
        "Well, I was thinking...",
        "Yeah!",
        "Hey.",
        "We can't leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!",
        "Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared. (she looks around) It's okay. Now, the way I see it, our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God, they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man.",
        "(panicking) But Emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way!",
        "Okay. Rachel, the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Yeah!",
        "Good! Oh yay! Let's get down to business! Emma needs some makeup!",
        "Well, she's gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants!",
        "Why not!",
        "Oh!",
        "No, we're late!",
        "Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!",
        "Uh, we were at the Spelling Bee!",
        "And it looks like she put makeup on her!",
        "You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!",
        "Alright, what are we gonna say?",
        "Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged!",
        "We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this: We can say that Monica told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. That way we're right on time! (Others start to agree but she continues) OR... or, we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.",
        "Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.",
        "Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon? (She places her hand over his \"fire\" and mimics a bursting water balloon, thus putting the fire out).",
        "It's locked.",
        "What are we gonna do? I'm starving.",
        "Oh yeah!",
        "Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us.",
        "So bad.",
        "Pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize (goes to the hall and comes back with Emma's trophy in her hand). Here! (gives it to Monica).",
        "Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving.",
        "I'll pull you through.",
        "I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.",
        "Just a sec., we're kind in the middle of something here.",
        "I know. Have you considered pageanting?",
        "If you had to, what would you give up, food or s*x?",
        "Ross, how about you. What would you give up, s*x or food?",
        "Ok, how about... uhm... s*x or dinosaurs?",
        "Oh, how cute!",
        "Oh, she looks just like a little doll!",
        "Oh, thank God, 'cause that thing's really creepy! (looking outside the window) Look, there's Chandler. (he's on the street, talking to a woman)",
        "OH! He's having an affair.",
        "You know, I'm always right about these things.",
        "Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it! (looking outside) See, there's something going on with them. Look, he's getting into the car with her!",
        "Oh yeah? Well, let's see. (she takes her mobile phone) Ok, duck down. (they both get down to hide themselves. Phoebe calls Chandler)",
        "Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so...(back to Central Perk) ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel.",
        "(shocked) Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either \"Liar, Liar\" or \"Betrayal\", or... \"An Affair To Remember\".",
        "Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm...",
        "(glancing at her) What?",
        "(to Chandler at the phone) Okay, we-we'll talk to you later. Okay, bye.",
        "Ok. Quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them.",
        "(patting her bag) I got them!",
        "So, should we tell her?",
        "Why? Who’d you seen him with?",
        "TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!",
        "All right. (she releases him). He is a good guy. You’re right, he wouldn’t cheat.",
        "Well, look, whatever happens, we’re here for you and we love you.",
        "They went in together. So sorry.",
        "What?",
        "Why do you have a realtor?",
        "So you're gonna move?",
        "Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?",
        "Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?",
        "Yeah, but so is this.",
        "You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?",
        "[looking outside the window] Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.",
        "Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.",
        "(walks him to the kitchen) Easy. Step. How did it get on?",
        "Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!",
        "Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey's ass!",
        "Ok, you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore.",
        "You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!",
        "What else?",
        "That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.",
        "Yeah, you don't wanna live in Westchester. That's like the worst of the Chesters.",
        "(to Monica) You're gonna be okay?",
        "Oh! These are the ones I was looking at in the store. (she got earrings)",
        "Great!",
        "Yeah, sorry boys, this ride's closing.",
        "(to Rachel) Thank you so much for this.",
        "Oh my God, it's all so elegant! When's the dirty stuff starting?",
        "You know, the strippers, and the guys dancing, and you know, pee-pee's flying about.",
        "Oh, ok. I see what you're doing, that's fine. This is all there is, just tea, uh, ok. (she drinks her tea) Hmmmm... raunchy!",
        "Really? So this is... this is my big send off in the married life? Rachel this is the only bachelorette party I'm ever gonna have! I've got a big wad of ones in my purse! Really? I mean, really? It's just tea?",
        "(Excited, running back to her seat) Oh!",
        "Oh, God!",
        "Rachel?",
        "Are you kidding?",
        "How old is your phonebook?",
        "Oh God no, I don't wanna see him take his clothes off!",
        "This is how I look when I'm turned on!",
        "Shocking!",
        "Three hundred dollars, are you kidding?",
        "No, you're not gonna pay him, he didn't do anything!",
        "I don't care. We're not paying you 300 dollars for this.",
        "Oh yeah, okay. I'm uptight. Yeah, that's why I don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what I can only assume is a child halloween costume! (turns to look at Monica and Rachel who look like they feel very sorry for the stripper)",
        "I'm sorry, did you say all man or old man?",
        "You know, it's fine. We'll pay you.",
        "Or you could teach stripping. You know, share your gift, pass the torch.",
        "There you go. Okay, do you think you're gonna be okay?",
        "(after a pause) Finish it!",
        "Your last dance. Do it for us.",
        "Yeah, yeah. He deserves to do the thing he loves one last time.",
        "Oh this is so ho-o-ot!",
        "Oh no, no, no, don't stop!",
        "Oh, hey Joey.",
        "Listen, I need to ask you something. Ok, you know how my step dad's in prison.",
        "Yeah. Well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday.",
        "No, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you would do it.",
        "Yeah, you've... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom...",
        "So... what do you say?",
        "Oh, thank you. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me.",
        "Oh.",
        "(her mobile phone rings) Oh, it's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy! (she answers) Hello... Hey, ok, stop screaming! Ok? So, halibut. All right, so salmon, either way. I don't-I don't... it doesn't matter to me!",
        "Well, I don't care, so you pick!",
        "Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.",
        "Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.",
        "Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and...",
        "Ok.",
        "Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.",
        "What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.",
        "She did? Why?",
        "(looking angry) Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free.",
        "Hey!",
        "Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?",
        "Rehearse it!",
        "So Rach.",
        "Where is Emma?",
        "What's up?",
        "Uhm... well, they're not in the wedding.",
        "I'm sorry you guys but, you know, Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were-you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut.",
        "Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!",
        "I don't have a fax machine.",
        "I decided to pee.",
        "Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!",
        "Oh, I don't wanna choose! It's (Rachel is walking by). Oh okay, wait. Rach! Listen I have a very special bridesmaid task for you today.",
        "Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that.",
        "All right, I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid.",
        "Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start. (she reads a note). My friend Joey and I decided to fix each other up with friends so I, I... (Monica is twirling her hands in order to make Phoebe speed up her speech) oh I... hum... I gave it a lot of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen who couldn't be here tonight because... (Monica is tapping her watch with her finger) it's not important... she is in rehab. Anyway, so, ok, Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike, only he didn't have a friend Mike so he just brought, uhm, my Mike and, and (Monica clears her throat) but despite, you know... it got... it got good. Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here...",
        "And... moment's over! (Rachel, Joey and Chandler all turn and look disapprovingly towards Monica but she just shrugs it off) So, ok, uh, I can forget that. I can forget that and uhm... (she's flipping cards skipping half of them) Oh this is funny! Oh, but you need to know that to... that, to... Oh, ok, well, uhm, I (Monica is miming CUT). Ok, ok, I, ok, I.... MONICA I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THIS! THIS IS MY WEDDING! OKAY, I DON'T WANT THIS (she mimes Monica's when she was twirling her hands) OR THIS (she taps her watch) OR THIS (she mimes CUT) OK? I JUST WANTED A SIMPLE WEDDING! WHERE MY FIANCEE CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM ANYTIME HE WANTS! (pause) You know what? You're done.",
        "YOU'RE FIRED! (mimes the CUT again) (pause and she raises her glass) Cheers! (Chandler raises his, smiling and Monica stares at him and he puts down his glass.)",
        "Hey!",
        "Oh, happy my wedding day to you!",
        "Oh, well that's ok. I think you and I will do much better if you're just... here as a bridesmaid.",
        "Wow, this is a lot!",
        "You won awards?",
        "Sven I don't understand what you're saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins?",
        "Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word \"lorkins\" what flowers would that be?",
        "Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!",
        "No! We're gonna do it my way. (listens) Because your way is stupid! Alright I gotta go, I have another call, Reverend. (switches calls) Hello?",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh my God, what's it doing here?",
        "(starting to panic) Oh my God, everything is such a mess. Why is this happening to me?",
        "Alright, wait, so what you're saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? Are you, are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!?",
        "(to Monica) Help me.",
        "I want you to be Crazy Bitch again.",
        "(Nearly in tears) Please?",
        "More than I wanna get married.",
        "(sounds scared already) About what?",
        "I know.",
        "What?",
        "(Turning to Mike) What do you think?",
        "Me too! (turning to Monica) Monica, do you think we could do it?",
        "Oh, okay. Hi new dad. (Chandler waves)",
        "Uhuh, uhuh... Oh my God! This is really happening.",
        "Oh, thank you.",
        "I love you guys.",
        "(nervously) Okay.",
        "Oh wait, oh no. Wait.",
        "I don't care... I'll be my something blue.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Na-ah.",
        "When I was growing up, I didn't have a normal mom and dad, or a regular family like everybody else, and I always knew that something was missing. But now I'm standing here today, knowing that I have everything I'm ever gonna need... You are my family. (She puts the ring on Mikes finger)",
        "Oh wait, oh I forgot... and uhm... I love you... and you have nice eyes.",
        "I do.",
        "I got married! (everyone applauds) Could someone get me a coat, I'm freaking freezing.",
        "Hi",
        "Oh, he's at the doctor, he didn't poop the whole time we were there!",
        "Oh, why? What's up?",
        "Oui, bien sur je parle Français! Qu'est-ce que tu penses alors?",
        "Sure! Tout le plaisir est pour moi, mon ami.",
        "All right, it seems pretty simple. Your first line is \"My name is Claude\", so, just repeat after me. \"Je m'appelle Claude\".",

        "Je m'appelle Claude.",
        "Uh. It's not... quite what I'm saying.",
        "It does, really?",
        "All right, let just try it again. Really listen.",
        "(slowly) Je m'appelle Claude.",
        "Oh, mon Dieu!",
        "Hi!",
        "Oh!",
        "Ok. What are you gonna be doing today?",
        "Je m'appelle Claude.",

        "Hey Joey.",
        "Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought about it a lot and, and I know, I was too impatient. SO lets try it again.",
        "Really, can I hear some of it.",
        "Well, you're not, (she tries to smile and contain her anger, but loses it) You're not... you're not... again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH!",
        "How could you possibly think that?",
        "(in a French accent) Uh, excuse me. Uh, I am Reginé Philange. I was passing by when I heard this man speaking the regional dialect of my French town of Estée Lauder.",

        "Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic. (Chandler and Monica look puzzled) Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one.",
        "Yeah, she was just an agent.",
        "Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge.",
        "Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else.",
        "Hey. Everything ok?",
        "Estelle? Why?",
        "I’m guessing she does.",
        "Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her.",
        "Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason. (she leaves)",
        "Man, tough week for Estelle!",
        "Hey Joey, want come with me to… are you ok?",
        "No, that wouldn’t kill her. Ordinary embolism might.",
        "No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call you (Joey considers it)",
        "Because patience is the road to understanding (she thinks) which ... is the key... to a happy heart.",
        "(picking up her bag) All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?",
        "(on the other side of the line, still pretending to be Estelle) Joey, it's Estelle. (Joey's eyes bulge up, he looks afraid)",
        "Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for firing me.",
        "Well, I didn't think I should just drop by...",
        "Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay.",
        "(Looks around) It's alright. Look kiddo, I gotta go. Good luck with the career. You're gonna be huge.",
        "Morning.",
        "What's that?",
        "It's a baby chick and duck!",
        "I did not see that coming.",
        "Yes.",
        "That is the rule, though.",
        "Guess what? You're almost an uncle!",
        "Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl.",
        "Have you seen him throw a ball?",
        "What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?",
        "But do you wanna get back together?",
        "(screaming) YAY!",
        "(quietly) Yay!",
        "Oh, this is like the best day ever. Ever! You guys might get back together, Monica and Chandler are getting their baby, there are chicks and ducks in the world again! Oh, I feel like I'm in a musical! (Singing) \"Daa - raa... When the sun comes up, bright and beaming! And the moon comes...\"",
        "Guess we'll never know how it ends.",
        "(interrupting) Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm.",
        "Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel!",
        "Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. If she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go.",
        "I'm telling you! Oh, okay! This is the part of the musical where there'd be a really good convincing song. (Singing) \"Bam-bam, don't take no for an answer. Bam-bam, don't let love fly away. Bam-bam-bam-bam...\"",
        "Can't a girl finish a song around here?",
        "Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom.",
        "Unbelievable!",
        "Hey, what are you working on?",
        "How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?",
        "Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel?",
        "What?",
        "How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you slept together last night.",
        "Uh, Joe?",
        "No, you don't! She's going to Paris! She is going to meet somebody. Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It's... It's a city of Gunthers!",
        "Hey! What do you have there?",
        "Honey, that's gorgeous!",
        "Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.",
        "Oh, Jack Bing. I love that. Ooh, it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy, you know? \"Jack Bing, Morning Gazette. I'm gonna blow this story wide open!\"",
        "Oh yeah? Well, tell me which one, and I'll try slip it in my coat.",
        "One? How about a whole bunch?",
        "Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda dull.",
        "So, you just let her go?",
        "But now she'll never know how he feels!",
        "Woo!",
        "Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!",
        "You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to the airport.",
        "Hurry!",
        "That's okay. If - if we hit anything, the engine will explode, so you know, it's better if you're thrown from the car.",
        "Okay!",
        "I - I don't take passengers.",
        "My medallion number is, \"Get out of the cab!\"",
        "Get out of the cab!",
        "You can open your eyes now.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes, she jumped right back up.",
        "Do you wanna get to Rachel in time?",
        "You should have thought of that before you got in!",
        "Toll-booth.",
        "(screaming) Toll-booth! Four bucks. There are quarters in the glove compartment.",
        "Hurry!",
        "Okay.",
        "Damn, that window is clean.",
        "Ross, where are you going?",
        "What? What are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? Have you never chased anyone through the airport before?",
        "You have to get a ticket to get past security.",
        "Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass!",
        "Just one? I drive you all the way down here, and I don't get to see how it works out?",
        "We're on our honeymoon.",
        "I'm so lucky I married you.",
        "No, did we miss it?",
        "Maybe we have the flight-number wrong. God.",
        "Hey, it's me. Here's Ross.",
        "Well, I've never gone this fast before.",
        "She's got her cell, you could call her.",
        "You don't have any other choice!",
        "Rachel? Oh, good. Hey, by the way, did you just get on the plane?",
        "(To Ross) For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport.",
        "Uh, Rach, hang on.",
        "Uhm, actually no. No, you've... You have to get off the plane.",
        "I have this feeling that something's wrong with it. Something is wrong with the left Philange.",
        "I don't see her.",
        "There she is!",
        "(screaming) RACHEL!!",
        "Okay, you're on.",
        "I'm sorry.",
        "Hey.",
        "Yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway.",
        "He went home. He didn't want to see anybody.",
        "Hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment?",
        "So, I guess this is it."

        "Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.",
        "Just us.",
        "Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.",

You know, you just invited me over here for pasta,\n        and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together.\n        And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting\n        a little late, and I-I should just, um...(starts to leave)",

Or, else you're pretending\n        that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic\n        that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So\n        like which of these two guys do you want to be? (another guy\n        walks by)",

        "Oh! You’re right. Oh God. But, before I can say\n        ‘good-bye’, there’s something I really need you to know,\n        Chandler. The way I feel about you, it’s like, I finally\n        understand what Lionel Richie’s been singing about. Y'know, I\n        mean what we have, it’s like movie love, you’re my soulmate,\n        and I can’t believe we’re not going to be spending the rest of\n        our lives together.",

        "Yeah, um, I’m, I’m leaving now. (tries to get her leg out of\n        Chandler’s grasp, she finally does, but Chandler takes off\n        her shoe.)",
        "Good-bye Chandler Bing. (walks out with one shoe)",
        "Oh well, I’m divorced.",
        "Yeah, I’m riding the alimony pony. (Does the now famous laugh.)",
        "I just came up to say, \"Hi!\" Hi! (to Chandler) And you, sweetie, I’ll see you tonight.",

        "Bye.",
        "Bye-bye.",

        "Oh, look at us! Who would’ve thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails. (Does the laugh)",
        "I know! And I’m just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!",
        "Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.",
        "Oh no! Where to? (Gasps) Too Paris?",
        "Janice:Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?",
        "When?",
        "Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.",
        "(entering) Hey there Ross!",
        "Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didn’t really leave me much choice. Did you?",
        "(leaning in from the bedroom) Chandler! Come on, I’m gonna show how to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. It’s a real space saver.",
        "Okay, Chandler, come on!",
        "Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y’know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don’t really seem to care too much that you’re leaving.",
        "On no! No! It’s not good-bye, I’m not leaving until you get on that plane.",
        "What’s the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?",
        "Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I’ll wait for you. Do you even know how long you’re going to be gone?",
        "Oh. Well, I’ll right you everyday. (Reading the address) 15 Yemen Road, Yemen.",
        "Chandler?",
        "Chandler!",
        "No! No! I wanna see you take-off.",
        "(entering) Ross you left you scarf in…(sees everyone.) Hey you guys. (Does the laugh.)",
        "Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in Yemen! I'm a young woman! I have needs! I can't wait forever!",
        "So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me.",
        "Oh! Okay! (To Ross) You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me! (Does her famous, or is that infamous, laugh and exits.)",
        "Actually, I should get going.",
        "Yes! Yes! You did!",
        "What is wrong now?!",
        "I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job! And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee—ahh!! Ross, we need to talk.",
        "No-no-no, no. I'm going to talk. I believe that the sun has set on our day in the sun.",
        "(starting to cry) You're a very sweet person Ross, umm, unfortunately I don't think I can take another second of you whining!!",
        "Well yeah!!",
        "Are you gonna be okay?",
        "Okay.",
        "Oh hi! Well, I guess that's two out of three, Joey. (Laughs and exits.)",
        "I love the way you look every night Chandler! (Monica breaks the kiss and Chandler freezes in terror.) That’s why I made you this tape! Happy Birthday! Love Janice!",
        "Oh.... my.... God.",
        "How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the best chicken ever! (Does the laugh.)",
        "(notices Monica’s engagement ring) Ohh! What is that on your finger?! I’m blind!",
        "So, who’s the lucky guy?",
        "Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!",
        "Oh, what are you, stupid? It’s been three hours.",
        "I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don’t you tell about your lovely wedding?",
        "Oh…wait…you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing Careless Whisper or Lady In Red?",
        "Chandler?",
        "Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I just felt I couldn’t really be alone tonight. (Joey walks into view of the open door behind Janice, sees her, gets a terrified look on his face, and flees in horror.) I was wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with family.",
        "Please, it’s because otherwise I really don’t know what I might do.",
        "(starting to cry) Do you have any tissues?",
        "Okay! (She runs for the bathroom)",
        "Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.",
        "Why not?",
        "Okay, I’m going to need a comforter, but did you have a hypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal. (Makes some weird sound) Do you have a cat? ‘Cause it’s already happening. (Makes a nasal sound) Do you hear that? (She keeps making the nasal sound.)",
        "Why?",
        "He does?",
        "Oh…my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, I’ll go. (Starts for the door.) Good-bye Monica (hugs her), I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. Chandler, (hugs him) you call me when this goes in the pooper. (Hurries out.)",
        "I….can’t….believe this!",
        "I mean this is so great! We’re gonna be baby buddies! (Does the laugh.)",
        "Hi! Hi sweetheart! This is my husband Sid, I don’t think you’ve met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid. I nabbed him a year ago at the dermatologist’s office. Thank God for adult acne huh? (Does the laugh.)",
        "Oh y’know what? You have to speak very loudly when you’re talking to Sid, because he’s almost completely deaf.",
        "So? Congratulations you two, I didn’t even know you got married.",
        "What?!",
        "Why?!!",
        "Oh. Well then shut me up. (Does the laugh.)",
        "Uh-oh, I feel another one coming. (She makes a sound like a goose during the contraction.)",
        "Chandler Bing!",
        "Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler.",
        "It’s you. This is yours.",
        "(laughs) Look how nervous he gets! We haven’t slept together in years! (Laughs again.)",
        "(entering) Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.",
        "He’s a keeper. How are you feeling?",
        "Can I just say, I really admire what you’re doing. Just raising her all alone.",
        "Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?",
        "I’m telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say they’re gonna be there until they start their real family.",
        "Oh well that’s what I thought about my first husband, now I’m lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.",
        "I hate to be the one to say it, but honey you two (Her and Emma) are on your own.",
        "Oh hi!",
        "Say hello to Aaron, your future son-in-law.",
        "I’m gonna leave the three of you alone.",
        "Bye. (Exits.)",
        "OH MY GOD!!",
        "Ah ahahahhahaa! How great is this!",
        "Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time because apparently we...",
        "Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz they have to do it in a cup! (laughs) Oh! They gave you the kiddy size (looking at the cup in his hand).",
        "Please... go! (Then shouts after him) Just let me know if you need a hand!",
        "Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don't allow p0rn at home so this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit?",
        "That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?",
        "Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.",
        "Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children. I am sure it's gonna be just fine.",
        "What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you can't do it at a doctor's office?",
        "Oh my God!",
        "What a small world!\nChandler: And yet I never run into Beyonce!",
        "Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin! (does her irritating laugh). So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too? Ooh! Are we gonna have a bidding war? I'd better warn you, I'm a toughie (playfully punches Chandler, who tries to get away from her)",
        "Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it! (Chandler and Monica are utterly shocked) Ellen, we're going to talk numbers. (Grabs Ellen by her elbow and pulls her outside)",
        "Well... I just talked to Sid, we are definitely putting in an offer on the house... a-a-and I'll bet we get it.\nChandler: The Hitlers will be so disappointed.",
        "All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And... I'll see you later, neighbor. (Janice laugh)",
        "Oh, me too... (laughs)",
        "Huh?",
        "Oh... my...",
        "Chandler, what are you talking about?",
        "I don't know what to say... I mean, you know, obviously we have this... heat between us.",
        "But I love my husband. And I know you love your wife. Now, I don't think we should get this house now.",
        "Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.",
        "Although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness... (she kisses Chandler flat on the mouth. Chandler squirms. When she's finished, he looks at her lovingly but uneasily.) Goodbye Chandler Bing. (She leaves)"
